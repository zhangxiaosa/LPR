The initial value of `g` is set to the function `a`.\n2. Since `g` is declared as a `const` variable and its value is never reassigned, we can propagate the constant value of `a` to `g`.\n3. The line `e.prototype = undefined;` does not affect the value of `g`, so we can ignore it.\n4. The line `({ \"prototype\": a } = a);` is an object destructuring assignment. It reassigns the value of the `prototype` property of the object `{ \"prototype\": a }` to the value of `a`. Since `a` is already assigned to `g`, this assignment can be optimized out.\n5. The function `a` is not used after the assignment, so we can optimize it out as well.\n6. Finally, the program returns `g`, which is a constant value. So we can replace the whole program with the value of `g`.\n\nOptimized program:\n```json\n{\n  \"program\": \"function opt() {\\n  const g = a;\\n  return g;\\n}\"\n}\n```"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 202, "completion_tokens": 1306, "total_tokens": 1508}, "system_fingerprint": null}
