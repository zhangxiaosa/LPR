Inside the `opt` function:\n   - A try-catch block is used.\n   - An empty array named `a` is declared using `const` keyword.\n   - `Object.getPrototypeOf(a)` is assigned to the variable `b`, which gets the prototype of the array `a`.\n   - `toLocaleString` method is called on `b`, and the result is assigned to the variable `c`.\n   - The `unshift` method is called on an empty array (`[]`), with the `apply` method applied to `b` as the context (`this` value). The parameters passed to `unshift` are the value of `c` wrapped in an array (`[c]`).\n3. If an error occurs in the try block, the catch block defines a function named `eContent`.\n4. Finally, the function `opt` returns the value of `eContent`.\n\nTo optimize the `unshift` method, we need to modify the code by replacing `unshift` with a more efficient method or data structure.
