The program defines a function `opt()`.\n2. Inside `opt()`, there is another function definition `a()`. This means `a` is a function.\n3. The program assigns `a` to variable `b` using the statement `const b = a;`. So `b` is also a function.\n4. The program creates a new `Proxy` object `e` with `b` as the target and an empty handler `{}`. So `e` is a Proxy object.\n5. The program sets the prototype of `e` to `undefined` with the statement `e.prototype = undefined;`.\n6. The program destructure the property `\"prototype\"` from `b` and assigns it to `a` using the statement `({ \"prototype\": a } = b);`. This means `b.prototype` is assigned to `a`.\n7. Finally, the program returns `a`, which is a function.\n\nTo decompose the complex data type into variables with primary data types:\n\n1. `a` is a function, so we can consider it already in its primary data type.\n2. `b` is also a function, so it can be considered as a function.\n3. `e` is a Proxy object, which is a complex data type. To decompose it, we need to extract its properties.\n   - `e.target` represents the target of the Proxy, which is `b` in this case. So `e.target` can be considered a function.\n   - `e.handler` represents the handler object, which is an empty object in this case. We can consider it as an empty object literal `{}`.\n   - `e.prototype` is set to `undefined`, so we can assign `undefined` to a variable named `ePrototype`.\n4.
