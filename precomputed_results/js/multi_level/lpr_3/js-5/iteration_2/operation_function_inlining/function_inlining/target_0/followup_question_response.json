Replace the line `let e = new d(b, {});` with `let e = new d(function a() {}, {});` to create the `Proxy` object with the inlined function.\n\n4. Remove the line `e.prototype = undefined;` since the `prototype` property is no longer needed.\n\n5. Replace the line `\"prototype\": a = b;` with `\"prototype\": function a() {}` to assign the inlined function `a` to the property `prototype`.\n\n6. Finally, remove the `return a;` statement as it's no longer needed.\n\nHere's the final optimized program after inlining the function `a`:\n\n```javascript\nfunction opt() {\n    let d = Proxy;\n    let e = new d(function a() {}, {});\n    ({\n        \"prototype\": function a() {}\n    } = function a() {});\n}\n```\n\nNow, I will write the final optimized program into a JSON file using Markdown syntax:\n\n```json\n{\"program\": \"function opt() {\\n    let d = Proxy;\\n    let e = new d(function a() {}, {});\\n    ({\\n        \\\"prototype\\\": function a() {}\\n    } = function a() {});\\n}\"}\n```"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}, {"index": 1, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To optimize the target function `a` by function inlining, we need to replace all occurrences of `a` within the program code with the body of the `a` function.
