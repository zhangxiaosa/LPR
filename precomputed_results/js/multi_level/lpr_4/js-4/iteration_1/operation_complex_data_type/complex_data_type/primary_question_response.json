The `unshift()` method is invoked on the `b` array with the argument `4294967297`. This inserts the given argument at the beginning of the array.\n4. The `length` property of the `b` array is set to `256`, which modifies the length of the array.\n5.

This indicates that `b` is an array.\n3. The `unshift` method is called on the array `b` with the argument `4294967297`. This method adds elements to the beginning of the array. Since the array is modified, its data type doesn't change.\n4. The `length` property of the array `b` is set to `256`. This property determines the number of elements in the array.\n5. The `pop` method is called on the array `b`. This method removes and returns the last element of the array.\n6. The returned value from `b.pop()` is assigned to the variables `f` and `g`. Since the assignment is made from the result of popping an element from the array, both `f` and `g` are assigned the value of the last element in the array `b`.\n7. The value of `g` is returned from the `opt` function.\n   \nBased on this analysis, the only variable with a complex data type is `b`, which is an array.
