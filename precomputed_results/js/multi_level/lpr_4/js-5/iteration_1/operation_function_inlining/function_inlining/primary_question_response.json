The program starts with a function declaration: opt().\n2. Inside the opt() function, there is a nested function declaration: a().\n3. The program then creates a new Proxy object using the function a() as the target and an empty object as the handler. The generated Proxy object is not assigned to any variable.\n4. The statement \"new Proxy(a, {}).prototype = undefined;\" sets the prototype of the Proxy object to undefined.\n5. The program then uses object destructuring to assign the value of function a() to the \"prototype\" property of an object literal. This effectively assigns the function itself to the \"prototype\" property.\n6. Next, a constant variable g is declared and assigned the value of function a().\n7.
