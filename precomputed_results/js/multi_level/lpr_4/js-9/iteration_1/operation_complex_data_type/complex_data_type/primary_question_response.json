This is a method on the prototype object of the JavaScript `Array` constructor that adds an element to the beginning of an array. In this case, the element added is the number `9007199254740991`.\n   - Then, the expression `[][127]` is evaluated. This accesses the element at index `127` in an empty array, which would result in `undefined`.\n\nTo identify the variables with complex data types, we can see that there are no variables declared or used in the given program.
