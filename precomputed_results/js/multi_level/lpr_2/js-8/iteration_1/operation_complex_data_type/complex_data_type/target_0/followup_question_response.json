The variable `b` is being extracted from the empty array `[]` using the property name `\"__proto__\"`.\n5. After the assignment, the `unshift()` method is called on `b`, passing `b.toLocaleString()` as the argument.\n6. In the catch block, there is a function declaration for a function named `e()`.\n7.

The destructuring assignment uses the property `__proto__` to assign the value of `b`.\n\n5. After the destructuring assignment, the program calls the `unshift()` method on `b`. This method modifies the array by adding elements at the beginning. The argument passed to `unshift()` is the result of `toLocaleString()` method called on `b`.\n\n6.
