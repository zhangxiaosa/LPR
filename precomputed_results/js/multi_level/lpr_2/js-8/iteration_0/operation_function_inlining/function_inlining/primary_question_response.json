The program starts with a function named `opt` that takes no arguments.\n2. Inside the `opt` function, there is a `try` block.\n3. Within the `try` block:\n   - An empty array `a` is declared using `const`.\n   - An object destructuring assignment is performed using the `let` keyword. The object being destructured is `{ \"__proto__\": b }`, and it is assigned the value of `a`. This creates a variable `b`.\n   - The `toLocaleString` method is called on `b` and the result is assigned to `c`.\n   - The `unshift` method is called on `b` with `c` as the argument, and the result is assigned to `d`.\n4. There is a `catch` block with no specific error parameter.\n5. Inside the `catch` block, there is another function declaration named `e` that takes no arguments.\n6. The `try-catch` block ends.\n7.
