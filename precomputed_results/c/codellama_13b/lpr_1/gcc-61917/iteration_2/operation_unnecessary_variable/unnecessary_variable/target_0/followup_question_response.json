This is done by the constant propagation optimization.\n\nAdditionally, the variable `p1` in the function `fn3()` is optimized out because it is unused. The function `fn3()` only calls `fn1()` with `k` and `6` as arguments, and `p1` is not used in the function. Therefore, the variable `p1` can be optimized out.\n\nThe resulting optimized code is:\n```\nint fn1(int p1, int p2) {\n  return 6;\n}\n\nint fn3(int k) {\n  for (;;) {\n    for (; l; l++) {\n      k = 0;\n      while (k >= -27) {\n        k = 6;\n        k = k - k;\n      }\n    }\n    k || m[2][5];\n  }\n}\n\nint main() {\n  return 0;\n}\n```\nNote that the optimization of `p1` out of `fn3()` is done by copy propagation.",

Constant Propagation:\n\nIn the `fn1()` function, we can see that `p2` is a constant value of `6`. We can replace `p2` with the constant value `6` throughout the function. This will simplify the function and reduce the number of operations.\n\nHere's the optimized function:\n```c\nint fn1(int p1, int p2) {\n    return p1 - 6;\n}\n```\n2. Copy Propagation:\n\nIn the `fn3()` function, we can see that `p1` is assigned the value of `k - p1`. We can replace `p1` with `k - p1` throughout the function. This will simplify the function and reduce the number of operations.\n\nHere's the optimized function:\n```c\nint fn3(k) {\n    for (;;) {\n        for (; l; l++) {\n            k = 0;\n            while (k >= -27) {\n                k = fn1(k, 6);\n                k = k - p1;\n            }\n        }\n        p1 || m[2][5];\n    }\n}\n```\n3.

Loop Fusion:\n\nIn the `fn3()` function, we can see that the inner loop is a simple loop that increments `k` by `1` each time. We can fuse the inner loop with the outer loop and eliminate the inner loop.\n\nHere's the optimized function:\n```c\nint fn3(k) {\n    for (;;) {\n        for (;;) {\n            k = 0;\n            while (k >= -27) {\n                k = k - 6;\n            }\n            k++;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n7.

Function Inlining:\n\nIn the `main()` function, we can see that the `fn3()` function is called with no arguments. We can inline the function and eliminate the function call.\n\nHere's the optimized function:\n```c\nint main() {\n    for (;;) {\n        for (;;) {\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n9.
