This change allows the compiler to optimize the memory accesses to `m` and improve performance.\n\nWe have also changed the data type of variable `k` from `volatile int` to `int`.

The `volatile` keyword has also been removed from the `m` array, as it is not necessary in this context. Additionally, the `k` variable has been eliminated, as it is not used in the program. The `fn1` function has been inlined to reduce the number of function calls, and the `p1` variable has been optimized by eliminating the overhead of calculating its value on each iteration of the loop. The `main` function has been added to the program, as it is required for any C program.",
