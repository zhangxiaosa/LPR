The program has a function that takes two integers, p1 and p2, and returns their difference. The program also has two variables, k and l, and a 2D array m[5][8]. The function fn3 takes an integer p1 and has a loop that uses k and l to perform some operations. The program also has a variable main that is not used in the optimization process.\n\nThe de-composing of the given program into variables with primary data type is as follows:\n\n1. fn1(int, int): The function fn1 is a function that takes two integers as its parameters and returns their difference. This function is an integer function. Therefore, the function can be decomposed into variables with primary data type as follows:\n\nint fn1(int, int): This function has two integer parameters and returns an integer value.\n\n2. k: The variable k is an integer. Therefore, it can be decomposed into a primary data type as follows:\n\nint k;\n\n3. l: The variable l is an integer. Therefore, it can be decomposed into a primary data type as follows:\n\nint l;\n\n4. m[5][8]: The variable m is a 2D array of integers. Therefore, it can be decomposed into a primary data type as follows:\n\nint m[5][8];\n\n5. p1: The variable p1 is an integer. Therefore, it can be decomposed into a primary data type as follows:\n\nint p1;\n\n6. p2: The variable p2 is an integer. Therefore, it can be decomposed into a primary data type as follows:\n\nint p2;\n\nThe decomposed variables with primary data type are as follows:\n\nint fn1(int, int);\nint k;\nint l;\nint m[5][8];\nint p1;\nint p2;\n\nThe decomposed program without the function main is as follows:\n\nint fn1(int, int) { return p1 - p2; }\n\nint k;\nint l;\nint m[5][8];\n\nint fn3(int p1) {\n  for (;;) {\n    for (; l; l++) {\n      k = 0;\n      while (k >= -27) {\n        k = fn1(k, 6);\n        p1 = k - p1;\n      }\n    }\n    p1 || m[2][5];\n  }\n}\n\nThe target variable p1 is an integer, and the program is optimized to minimize the execution time of the function fn3. The function fn3 has a loop that uses k and l to perform some operations. The program also has a variable m[5][8]. Therefore, the program has two primary data types, an integer and an array of integers. The program is optimized to minimize the execution time of the function fn3, which has a variable p1 as its target.",
