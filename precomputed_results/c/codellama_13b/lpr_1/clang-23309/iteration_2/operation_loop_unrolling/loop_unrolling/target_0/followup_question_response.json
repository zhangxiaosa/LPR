This allows the compiler to see the entire loop at once and optimize it more effectively.\n\nNote that the loop has been unrolled by a factor of 3, since the loop variable `w` starts at 3 and is decremented by 1 each iteration. This makes it possible to unroll the loop by a factor of 3 without affecting the correctness of the program.",

The optimization is based on the assumption that the `w` variable is a small integer, and that the `switch` statement can be used instead of a `for` loop for this case.\n\nAlso, it's worth mentioning that in some cases, the `for` loop can be optimized by using the `while` loop instead of the `for` loop, as the `while` loop can be more efficient than the `for` loop in some cases.",
