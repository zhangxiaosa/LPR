It also has better cache locality because the function `fn3()` is now part of the same function as the caller.",

Here's the optimized version of `fn3()`:\n```\nlong fn3(long p1, long p2) {\n  return p1 - p2;\n}\n```\nIn the optimized version, we can see that the function call to `fn2()` and `fn4()` is eliminated, and the code has been simplified to return `p1 - p2`.",
