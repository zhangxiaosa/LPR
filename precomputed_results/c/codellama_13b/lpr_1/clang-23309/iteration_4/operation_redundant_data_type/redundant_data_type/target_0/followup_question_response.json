Since the function is not used anywhere else in the program, it can be safely removed.\n\nAlso, it's worth noting that in the function `fn13`, the variable `an` is declared as `short`, but it's assigned the value of 250, which is an `int` literal. In C, `short` is a 16-bit signed integer type, so it can only hold values between -32767 and 32767. However, 250 is outside this range, so it will be promoted to an `int` when it's assigned to `an`.\n\nIn the function `fn9`, the variable `ap` is declared as `int`, but it's not used anywhere in the function. It can be safely removed.\n\nFinally, in the function `fn13`, the variable `w` is declared as `short`, but it's used as a loop counter. Since the loop counter is not used anywhere else in the function, it can be safely changed to `int` to avoid any potential issues with the loop.",
