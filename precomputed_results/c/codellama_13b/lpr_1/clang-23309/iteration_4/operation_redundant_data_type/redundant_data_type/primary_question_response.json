It would be more appropriate to declare `v` as a `short` type instead of an `unsigned` type.\n* The variable `w` is declared as a `short` type, but it is only used to store a single value of type `int` in the `fn13` function. It would be more appropriate to declare `w` as an `int` type instead of a `short` type.\n* The variable `an` is declared as a `short` type, but it is only used to store a single value of type `int` in the `fn13` function. It would be more appropriate to declare `an` as an `int` type instead of a `short` type.\n* The variable `ao` is declared as a `short` type, but it is only used to store a single value of type `int` in the `fn13` function. It would be more appropriate to declare `ao` as an `int` type instead of a `short` type.\n* The variable `ac` is declared as a `short` type, but it is only used to store a single value of type `int` in the `fn13` function. It would be more appropriate to declare `ac` as an `int` type instead of a `short` type.\n\nBy making these changes, the code would be more concise and easier to read, and it would also make it easier to understand the meaning of the code and make any necessary changes.",
