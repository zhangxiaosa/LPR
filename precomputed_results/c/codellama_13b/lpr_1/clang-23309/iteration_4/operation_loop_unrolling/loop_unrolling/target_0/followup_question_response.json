By doing this, we have eliminated the loop and replaced it with three separate checks, which can be executed more efficiently.\n\nIt's worth noting that loop unrolling can be a useful technique for improving the performance of code, but it should be used with caution. In this case, the loop is very short and the cost of the three separate checks is likely to be negligible compared to the cost of the other operations being performed. However, in other cases, the loop may be much longer and the cost of the extra checks may be significant.",
