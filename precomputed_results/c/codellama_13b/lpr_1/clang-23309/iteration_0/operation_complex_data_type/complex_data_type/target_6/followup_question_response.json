Remove unused variables: There are several variables in the program that are not used, such as `ap` and `p1` in `fn10`, `p2` and `p3` in `fn11`, and `p4` and `p5` in `fn12`. You can remove these variables to reduce the code size and improve performance.\n2. Use more efficient data types: In some cases, the data types used in the program are not the most efficient. For example, `int` and `long` can be replaced with `short` or `unsigned short` in some cases. Similarly, `unsigned char` can be replaced with `char` in some cases.\n3. Use constant folding: In some cases, the program uses constant expressions that can be evaluated at compile-time. You can use constant folding to evaluate these expressions and replace them with the resulting constant values.\n4. Remove unnecessary code: There are some unnecessary statements in the program that can be removed to improve performance. For example, the statement `if (an = 250UL) {` in `fn12` can be removed because the condition is always true.\n5. Use loop unrolling: In some cases, the program uses loops that can be unrolled to improve performance. For example, the loop in `fn12` can be unrolled to remove the loop overhead.\n6. Use function inlining: In some cases, the program uses function calls that can be inlined to improve performance. For example, the function `fn1` can be inlined in `main` to remove the function call overhead.\n7. Use register optimization: In some cases, the program uses registers that can be optimized to improve performance. For example, the register `w` in `fn12` can be optimized to reduce the number of register accesses.\n\nBy applying these techniques, you can improve the performance of the program and make it more efficient.",
