Similarly, the variable `h_array` is decomposed into two primary data type variables `h_array1` and `h_array2`. The variable `j` is also decomposed into two primary data type variables `j1` and `j2`.\n\nThe `if` condition in the `fn1` function is also decomposed into two conditions `if (f1.e)` and `if (f2.e)`. The `goto` instruction is also decomposed into two `goto` statements `goto i1` and `goto i2`.\n\nThe `main` function is also decomposed into two functions `main1` and `main2`. The variables `j` and `h_array` are not declared in the `main` function, and they are declared in the `fn1` function.\n\nThe optimized code for the program is:\n```\nstruct c {\n  int d;\n  int e;\n};\nstruct c f1, f2;\nint h_array1[6], h_array2[6];\n\nint fn1() {\n  if (f1.e)\n    goto i1;\n  fn1();\n  int j1;\n  return j1;\ni1:\n  f1.d = h_array1[5];\n  fn1();\n  j1 = 0xEEACFBBFL;\n  return j1;\n}\n\nint fn2() {\n  if (f2.e)\n    goto i2;\n  fn2();\n  int j2;\n  return j2;\ni2:\n  f2.d = h_array2[5];\n  fn2();\n  j2 = 0xEEACFBBFL;\n  return j2;\n}\n\nint main1() {\n  fn1();\n  int j1;\n  return j1;\n}\n\nint main2() {\n  fn2();\n  int j2;\n  return j2;\n}\n```\nIn this optimized code, the `if` condition is decomposed into two conditions `if (f1.e)` and `if (f2.e)`.
