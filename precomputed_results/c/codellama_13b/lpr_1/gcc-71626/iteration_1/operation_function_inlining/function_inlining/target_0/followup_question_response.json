The `inline` keyword tells the compiler to replace the call to `fn1()` with the body of the function directly in the code. This allows the compiler to optimize away the function call and reduce the overhead associated with it.\n\nNote that the `inline` keyword is not always guaranteed to be effective, and it may be ignored by the compiler if it determines that doing so would not result in a performance gain. However, in this case, the function is very simple and inlining it should result in a significant performance improvement.",

This is done by defining the `fn1()` function as an inline function using the `inline` keyword. This allows the compiler to replace the call to `fn1()` with the function body itself, making the code more efficient.\n\nAfter inlining the function, we can see that the `fn2()` function now returns a `d` vector with the value `0`, which is the value returned by the inlined `fn1()` function. This means that the `main()` function will now return a `d` vector with the value `0`, which is the same as the original program.\n\nBy inlining the `fn1()` function, we have optimized the program to reduce the size of the code and improve performance. The inlined function can be treated as a normal function call, but with the added benefit of not having to perform a function call. This can make the code more efficient and faster to execute.",
