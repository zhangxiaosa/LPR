Therefore, it can be safely optimized out.\n* `fn1` is also a local variable in `fn2` and is not used in the function. Therefore, it can be safely optimized out.\n* `d f = {c};` is a constant initialization of `f` with the value of `c`. Since `c` is a constant and optimizable, this statement can be simplified to `d f = {fn1};`.\n* Therefore, the optimized program is equivalent to the original program, but with the unused variables removed.",
