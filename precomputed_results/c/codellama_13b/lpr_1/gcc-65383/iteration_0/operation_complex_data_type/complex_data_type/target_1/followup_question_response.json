To optimize the program, we need to reduce the size of the array \"h\".\n\nOne way to do this is to use a smaller data type for the array elements. In this case, we can use \"unsigned short\" instead of \"unsigned int\" for the array elements. This will reduce the size of the array from 32 bytes to 12 bytes.\n\nHere is the modified program:\n```\nunsigned short h[3] = {0x92A1, 0x92A1, 0x92A1};\n```\nThis change will reduce the size of the array \"h\" by 20 bytes, which is the difference between the size of an \"unsigned int\" and an \"unsigned short\".\n\nIt's important to note that this optimization is only valid if the values in the array \"h\" can be represented with \"unsigned short\" without losing any information. If the values in the array are larger than what can be represented with \"unsigned short\", then this optimization will not be possible.",
