This optimization is called constant propagation, and it eliminates the variable `f` from the program.\n\nIt's worth noting that copy propagation is a different optimization technique that can be applied to the same program, but it would require a different approach. Copy propagation involves replacing a variable with its initializer or a value that is computed from its initializer, and it can be applied to variables that are not constants.",
