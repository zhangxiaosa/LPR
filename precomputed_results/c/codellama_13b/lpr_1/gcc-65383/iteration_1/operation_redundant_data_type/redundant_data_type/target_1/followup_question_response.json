We have also changed the type of the `r` array to `int` instead of `unsigned`.\n\nNote that this modification is only a simplified version of the original program, and it may not be equivalent to the original program in all cases. The original program may have been optimized for specific hardware or software platforms, and this simplified version may not be optimized in the same way.

Since the values in `h` are non-negative, they can be represented as an `int` data type.\n* The value of `0x92A1D2CDL` is equal to 2388214644, which is less than the maximum value that can be represented by an `int` data type (2147483647). Therefore, the data type of `h` can be changed to `int` without losing any information.\n* The value of `0xC3L` is equal to 195, which is less than the maximum value that can be represented by an `int` data type. Therefore, the data type of `fn1()` can be changed to `int` without losing any information.\n* The value of `0x06D7L` is equal to 1711, which is less than the maximum value that can be represented by an `int` data type. Therefore, the data type of `r` can be changed to `int` without losing any information.",
