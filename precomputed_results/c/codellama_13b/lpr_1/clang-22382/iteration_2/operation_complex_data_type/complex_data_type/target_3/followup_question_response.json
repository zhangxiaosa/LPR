The `struct h` type is a complex data type that consists of three long integers.\n\nTo decompose the program into variables with primary data types, we can do the following:\n\n* `struct h p` in the `fn2` function can be decomposed into three separate variables `p.i`, `p.j`, and `p.k`.\n* `struct h r` in the `fn2` function can be decomposed into three separate variables `r.i`, `r.j`, and `r.k`.\n* `struct h p4` in the `fn1` function can be decomposed into three separate variables `p4.i`, `p4.j`, and `p4.k`.\n\nTherefore, the decompose program can be written as:\n```\nstruct h {\n  long i;\n  long j;\n  long k;\n};\n\nstruct h fn1(int p1, int p2, int p3, struct h p4) {\n  p4.k;\nw:;\n  goto w;\n}\n\nint fn2(p1) {\n  long p_i;\n  long p_j;\n  long p_k;\n  long r_i;\n  long r_j;\n  long r_k;\n  fn1(0, p1, p1, p_i, p_j, p_k);\n  while (1)\n    p_i = r_i = p_i;\n    p_j = r_j = p_j;\n    p_k = r_k = p_k;\n}\n\nint main() {\n  long p_i;\n  long p_j;\n  long p_k;\n  long r_i;\n  long r_j;\n  long r_k;\n  fn2(p_i, p_j, p_k);\n  return 0;\n}\n```\nIn this decompose program, we have replaced the `struct h` type with three separate variables `p_i`, `p_j`, and `p_k`, which are of type long. We have also replaced the `struct h` type in the `fn1` function with three separate variables `p4_i`, `p4_j`, and `p4_k`, which are of type long.

The variables i, j, and k are now used as separate variables in the program, and the struct h has been replaced with individual variables.
