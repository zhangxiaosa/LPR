The `static struct h fn1()` function has also been modified to use these variables instead of the `struct h` variable. The `fn2()` function has been modified to use the `s` variable, which is an instance of the `struct h` type.\n\nThe `main()` function has been modified to initialize the `s` variable with values for `i`, `j`, and `k`, and then call the `fn2()` function with `s.k` as an argument.\n\nThis is a simplified version of the original program, and the changes made may not be semantically equivalent to the original program. However, they do demonstrate how the `struct h` variable could be decomposed into separate variables with primary data types.",
