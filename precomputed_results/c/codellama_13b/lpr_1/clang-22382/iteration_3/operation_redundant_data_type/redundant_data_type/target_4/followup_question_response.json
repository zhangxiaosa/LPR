The `fn1` function takes four parameters, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `p4`, where `p4` is a pointer to a `struct h` variable.

The `while` loop in `fn2` repeatedly assigns the value of `p` to `r` and then assigns the value of `r` to `p`.\n\nTo optimize the program, we can eliminate the `struct h` data type and replace every instance of it with its associated original data type, which is `long`. This will simplify the code and improve its readability. Here's the optimized program:\n```\nlong fn1(long p1, long p2, long p3, long p4) {\n  p4;\n  while (1) {\n    p4 = p4;\n  }\n}\n\nint fn2(long p1) {\n  long p;\n  long r;\n  fn1(0, p1, p1, p);\n  while (1) {\n    p = r = p;\n  }\n}\n\nint main() {}\n```\nIn this optimized program, the `struct h` data type has been eliminated, and every instance of it has been replaced with the `long` data type.
