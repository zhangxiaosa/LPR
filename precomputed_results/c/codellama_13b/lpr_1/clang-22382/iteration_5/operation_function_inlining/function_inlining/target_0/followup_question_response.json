This is done by replacing the function call `fn1(p)` with the body of the function, which is the `while` loop. This allows the compiler to eliminate the function call overhead and improve the performance of the program.\n\nThe resulting program is still valid, as the function `fn1` is still defined and can be called by other parts of the program.
