One way to do this is to use a single structure to store all the variables that are currently being used as separate variables. For example, we can define a structure `struct h_all` that contains all the variables that are currently being used as separate variables, and then use this structure to pass the variables to the `fn1` function. Here is an example of how this could be done:\n```\nstruct h_all {\n  int i;\n  long j;\n  int k;\n  int l;\n};\n\nstatic struct h fn1(int p1, int p2, int p3, int p4, struct h_all p5) {\n  p5.k;\n  goto w;\n}\n\nint fn2(p1) {\n  struct h_all p;\n  int q;\n  fn1(q, l, p1, 3, p);\n  for (;;) {\n    struct h_all r;\n    p = r = p;\n  }\n}\n\nint main() {}\n```\nIn this modified version of the program, we have defined a single structure `struct h_all` that contains all the variables that are currently being used as separate variables. We have then modified the `fn1` function to take a single argument of type `struct h_all`, and we have modified the `fn2` function to use the `struct h_all` structure to pass the variables to the `fn1` function. This should help to reduce the number of variables with complex data types in the program.",
