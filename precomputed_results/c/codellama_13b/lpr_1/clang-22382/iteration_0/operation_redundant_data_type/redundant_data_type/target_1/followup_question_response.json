In this case, we have:\n\n* struct h.i -> signed\n* struct h.j -> long\n* struct h.k -> unsigned\n\nSo the rewritten program would be:\n```\nsigned l;\nstatic signed fn1(unsigned p1, short p2, unsigned p3, unsigned p4,\n                   signed p5) {\n  p5.k;\nw:;\n  goto w;\n}\nunsigned fn2(unsigned p1) {\n  signed p;\n  int q;\n  fn1(q, l, p1, 3, p);\n  for (;;) {\n    signed r;\n    p = r = p;\n  }\n}\nint main() {}\n```\nThis eliminates the \"struct h\" type and replaces it with its individual members.\n\nNote: In the rewritten program, the return type of \"fn1\" has been changed from \"struct h\" to \"signed\". This is because the original program had a statement \"p5.k\" that accesses the \"k\" member of a \"struct h\" variable \"p5\", and this statement is not valid for the \"struct h\" type. The rewritten program uses the \"signed\" type instead, which is the type of the \"k\" member.",
