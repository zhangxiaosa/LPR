To optimize this function, we can eliminate the `goto` statement and replace it with a loop that will iterate until the condition `p5.k` is true.\n\nHere is the optimized version of `fn1`:\n```\nint fn1(int p1, short p2, int p3, int p4, struct h p5) {\n  while (!p5.k) {\n    /* do nothing */\n  }\n}\n```\nThis optimized version of `fn1` will eliminate the `goto` statement and replace it with a loop that will iterate until the condition `p5.k` is true. This will improve the performance of the function by reducing the number of jumps and the number of times the function needs to be executed.\n\nTo optimize `fn2`, we can eliminate the loop that iterates forever and replace it with a loop that will iterate until `p` is equal to `r`.\n\nHere is the optimized version of `fn2`:\n```\nint fn2(int p1) {\n  struct h p;\n  int q;\n  fn1(q, l, p1, 3, p);\n  while (p != r) {\n    /* do nothing */\n  }\n}\n```\nThis optimized version of `fn2` will eliminate the loop that iterates forever and replace it with a loop that will iterate until `p` is equal to `r`.
