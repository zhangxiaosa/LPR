This means that the `fn1` function has been replaced with its implementation, which is the `while` loop. This allows the compiler to optimize out the function call and generate more efficient code.\n\nNote that the `return` statement has been added to the `fn1` function to return the result of the `while` loop.

This is done by copying the contents of `fn1` and pasting it into `fn2` at the place where the call to `fn1` is made.\n\nThe resulting program is still equivalent to the original program, but with better performance. The function call to `fn1` is eliminated, which reduces the overhead of calling a function and allows the program to run faster.\n\nNote that this optimization is only possible if the function `fn1` is small and can be inlined into the calling function without increasing the size of the code significantly.
