Use a pointer to the structure instead of a copy of the structure. This can reduce the amount of memory used and improve performance.\n2. Use a reference to the structure instead of a pointer to the structure. This can simplify the code and improve readability.\n3. Use a constant pointer to the structure instead of a pointer to the structure. This can improve performance by reducing the number of memory accesses.\n4. Use a pointer to the structure instead of a reference to the structure. This can improve performance by reducing the number of memory accesses.\n\nHere is an example of how these techniques can be applied to the `r` variable in the program:\n```\nstruct h {\n  int i;\n  long j;\n  int k;\n};\n\nstatic struct h fn1(int p1, int p2, int p3, int p4, struct h p5) {\n  p5.k;\nw:;\n  goto w;\n}\n\nint fn2(p1) {\n  struct h p;\n  int q;\n  fn1(q, 0, p1, 3, p);\n  while (1) {\n    struct h *r = &p;\n    p = *r = p;\n  }\n}\n\nint main() {}\n```\nIn this example, we use a pointer to the structure instead of a copy of the structure. We use a reference to the structure instead of a pointer to the structure. We use a constant pointer to the structure instead of a pointer to the structure. We use a pointer to the structure instead of a reference to the structure.\n\nBy using these techniques, we can optimize the program and improve its performance. However, it is important to note that the best approach will depend on the specific requirements of the program and the target system.",
