The function `fn2` takes one argument of type `int` and returns a value of type `int`.\n\nTo optimize the program, we need to decompose the `struct h` variable into variables with primary data types. We can do this by breaking down the structure into its individual components and replacing the structure with the individual variables.\n\nHere is the optimized program:\n```\nint i;\nlong j;\nint k;\n\nstatic struct h fn1(int p1, int p2, int p3, int p4, struct h p5) {\n  p5.k;\nw:;\n  goto w;\n}\n\nint fn2(p1) {\n  int q;\n  fn1(q, 0, p1, 3, i, j, k);\n  while (1) {\n    int r_i;\n    long r_j;\n    int r_k;\n    i = r_i = i;\n    j = r_j = j;\n    k = r_k = k;\n  }\n}\n\nint main() {\n  int q;\n  fn1(q, 0, 1, 3, i, j, k);\n  while (1) {\n    int r_i;\n    long r_j;\n    int r_k;\n    i = r_i = i;\n    j = r_j = j;\n    k = r_k = k;\n  }\n}\n```\nIn this optimized program, we have replaced the `struct h` variable with three individual variables `i`, `j`, and `k` of types `int`, `long`, and `int`, respectively.

To optimize the program, we would need to understand the purpose of the program and the target to be optimized.\n\nBased on the information provided, it seems like the target to be optimized is the `struct h` structure type. To optimize this structure, we would need to understand the purpose of the program and how the structure is being used.\n\nHere is a possible decomposition of the `struct h` structure into variables with primary data types:\n```\nstruct h {\n  int i;\n  long j;\n  int k;\n};\n```\nIn the given program, the `struct h` structure is used to store 3 integer variables `i`, `j`, and `k`.

The `fn1` function is not declared in the program, so it is not possible to optimize it. However, the `fn2` function is optimized by decomposing the `struct h` structure into 3 variables with primary data types `int`, `long`, and `int`.\n\nOverall, the optimization of the `struct h` structure depends on the specific use case and requirements of the program.
