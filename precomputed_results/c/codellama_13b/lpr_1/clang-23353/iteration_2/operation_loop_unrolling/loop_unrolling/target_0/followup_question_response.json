This eliminates the loop and the overhead associated with it.",

This is done by replacing the loop with the following code:\n```\np3 = 6;\nj ^= fn1(p3, i) && 1L;\np3--;\nj ^= fn1(p3, i) && 1L;\np3--;\nj ^= fn1(p3, i) && 1L;\np3--;\nj ^= fn1(p3, i) && 1L;\np3--;\nj ^= fn1(p3, i) && 1L;\n```\nNote that this optimization is not always possible, as the loop may contain more complex instructions that cannot be unrolled.
