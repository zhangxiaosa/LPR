The resulting program is:\n```\nchar fn1(char p1, char p2) { return p1 * p2; }\nint i;\nchar j;\nchar *fn2(int p1, char *p2, char p3) {\n  for (p3 = 6; p3 != -7; p3--)\n    j ^= fn1(p3, i) && 1L;\n  return p2;\n}\nint main() { return 0; }\n```\nNote that we had to change the data type of the variable `j` from struct to char, since we are no longer using it as a struct. We also had to change the data type of the function `fn2` to return a char instead of a char pointer, since we are no longer using it to return a struct.",
