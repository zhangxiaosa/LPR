This is because the `i` variable is used in the `fn1` function, which takes two `signed char` parameters.

This change is necessary because the variable is only used in the `fn1` function, which only accepts `signed char` arguments. By changing the type of `i` to `signed char`, we can avoid unnecessary type conversions and improve the efficiency of the program.\n\nAdditionally, we have changed the type of the `p2` parameter in `fn2` from `int*` to `signed char*`. This is necessary because the function only uses the `p2` parameter to index into an array of `signed char` values, and the only operation performed on `p2` is a multiplication with a `signed char` value. By changing the type of `p2` to `signed char*`, we can avoid unnecessary type conversions and improve the efficiency of the program.\n\nFinally, we have changed the type of the `p3` parameter in `fn2` from `unsigned int` to `signed char`.
