This is because `i` is not used in the function and can be safely replaced with a constant value.\n\nAdditionally, the loop in `fn2` has been modified to use the constant value `6` instead of `p3` for the loop condition. This is because the loop condition `p3 != -7` is always true for the constant value `6`, and the loop can be optimized out.\n\nOverall, this optimized program is functionally equivalent to the original program, but with the unnecessary variable `i` removed and the loops optimized out.",
