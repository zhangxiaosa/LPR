This has resulted in a more efficient program, as there is no longer a function call and return involved.\n\nThe optimized program looks like this:\n```\nint i;\nchar j;\n\nchar fn2(p3) {\n  for (p3 = 6; p3 != -7; p3--)\n    j ^= p1 * p2 && 1L;\n  return 0;\n}\n\nint main() {\n  return 0;\n}\n```\nIn this optimized program, the function `fn1` is no longer present, and the body of the function has been directly integrated into the `fn2` function.

It multiplies the two arguments and returns the result.\n\nTo optimize this function out, we can use function inlining. The idea is to replace the call to `fn1` with the actual function body.\n\nHere is the optimized code:\n```c\nint i;\nchar j;\nchar fn2(p3) {\n  for (p3 = 6; p3 != -7; p3--)\n    j ^= p3 * i && 1L;\n  return 0;\n}\nint main() { return 0; }\n```\nIn this optimized code, the call to `fn1` has been replaced with the actual function body, which is `p1 * p2`. This allows the compiler to optimize out the function call and inline the function, resulting in faster execution.",
