This means that the function call to `fn1` has been replaced with the body of the function, which is simply `return p2;`. This has allowed the compiler to optimize the code by eliminating the function call and reducing the number of instructions.\n\nIt's worth noting that this optimization is only possible because the function `fn1` is a simple function that only returns its second parameter. If the function had any side effects or other complex behavior, this optimization would not be possible.",

This is done by replacing the call to `fn1` with the body of the function. The resulting program is equivalent to the original program, but with the function call removed.\n\nTo inline the function, we need to replace the call to `fn1` with the body of the function.

The `fn1` function is no longer called as a separate function, but instead its code has been copied into the `fn3` function. This is known as function inlining.\n\nThe function inlining optimization has resulted in the following changes to the program:\n\n* The `fn1` function has been removed from the program.\n* The code of the `fn1` function has been copied into the `fn3` function.\n* The call to the `fn1` function in the `fn3` function has been replaced by the copied code.\n* The `fn1` function's parameters `p1` and `p2` have been replaced by the local variables `u` and `v` in the `fn3` function.\n\nBy inlining the `fn1` function, the program has been optimized for better performance. The function call overhead has been eliminated, and the program has become smaller and more efficient.",

To inline `fn1`, we need to modify the `fn3` function to call `fn1` directly.\n\nHere's the modified program:\n```c\nint fn1(int p1, int p2) { return p2; }\n\nstruct m {\n  signed n : 18;\n  signed o : 1;\n};\n\nint r;\n\nstatic signed s = -5L;\n\nunsigned t;\n\nint u;\n\nunsigned v;\n\nint fn3(q_l) {\n  struct m ad = {1957};\n  ad.o = fn1(v, 5);\n  signed ae;\n  ae = ad.o;\n  ad.o = u;\n  r = t % (~s / ae);\n  ad.o;\n}\n\nint main() { fn3(0); }\n```\n\nIn this modified program, the `fn1` function is inlined into the `fn3` function, which means that the function call to `fn1` is replaced with the body of the `fn1` function.

This allows the compiler to eliminate the function call and any overhead associated with it, resulting in faster execution time.\n\nThe optimization is valid because the function `fn1(int, int)` takes two `int` parameters and returns an `int` value. The function body is simply `return p2`, which means that the function is not doing any computation or memory accesses, and can be safely inlined.\n\nAlso, note that the function `fn1(int, int)` is not changed in any way, the only thing that is changed is the way it is called. The function is not renamed, nor is any of its code changed, the only thing that is changed is how it is called in the `fn3(q_l)` function.",
