The `o_prime` field has been replaced with a local variable `ae` in the `fn3` function, which is set to the value of `o_prime` before it is set to 0.

This change was made to simplify the analysis and optimization process. The original data type of `m.o_prime` was a bit field with a width of 1 bit, which is not commonly used in practice. By changing the data type to `int`, we can take advantage of the full range of values that an `int` can represent, which may help to optimize the program more effectively.\n\nIn addition to changing the data type of `m.o_prime`, the program has also been modified to use the `fn1` function instead of the `fn3` function. This was done to simplify the analysis and optimization process, as the `fn1` function is a simple function that can be easily analyzed and optimized.\n\nOverall, the modified program is a simplified version of the original program that is easier to analyze and optimize. The use of `int` instead of a bit field for `m.o_prime` and the use of `fn1` instead of `fn3` are changes that can help to improve the performance of the program.",
