In the line `ad.o_prime = fn1(5, 5);`, the value of `ad.o_prime` is set to `5`, which is the return value of the function `fn1`. Since `fn1` only returns the second parameter, we can optimize this line by replacing `ad.o_prime` with `5`.\n2. In the line `int ae = ad.o_prime;`, the value of `ad.o_prime` is copied to the local variable `ae`. Since `ae` is not used within the function, we can optimize this line by removing it and replacing it with `5`.\n3. In the line `ad.o_prime = 0;`, the value of `ad.o_prime` is set to `0`. Since `ad.o_prime` is not used within the function, we can optimize this line by removing it.\n4. In the line `r = t % (~s / 5);`, the value of `r` is set to the result of the expression `t % (~s / 5)`. Since `s` is a constant value, we can optimize this line by replacing it with `r = t % (~(-5) / 5)`, which simplifies to `r = t % 5`.\n\nThe optimized program has eliminated the unused variable `ae` and simplified the expression `r = t % (~s / 5)` to `r = t % 5`.",
