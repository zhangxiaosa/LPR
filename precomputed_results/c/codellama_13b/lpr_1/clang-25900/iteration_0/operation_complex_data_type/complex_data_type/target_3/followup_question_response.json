Since `struct k` is a complex data type, we can decompose it into its component parts. In this case, `struct k` has one member variable `l` which is of type `unsigned`.\n\nTherefore, we can optimize the program by replacing `q.l` with `q.l.l`, which is the `unsigned` member variable of the `struct k` type.
