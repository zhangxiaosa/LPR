The function is now defined as `fn3(int q_l)`, and the call to `fn3` in `main` is updated to pass in the value `0`.\n\nWe also applied constant propagation to the expression `~s / ae` in the line `r = t % (~s / ae);`. Since `s` is a constant value, we can evaluate the expression `~s / ae` at compile-time and replace it with the constant value. The line is now `r = t % (-1 / ae);`.\n\nFinally, we applied copy propagation to the variable `ad.o` in the line `ad.o = u;`. Since `u` is a constant value, we can replace all occurrences of `ad.o` with `u` in the function. The line is now `r = t % (-1 / u);`.\n\nOverall, this optimization results in a more efficient and smaller program.",
