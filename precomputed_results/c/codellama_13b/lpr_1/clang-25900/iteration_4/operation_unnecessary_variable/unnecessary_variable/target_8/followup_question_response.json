Additionally, the `o_prime_2` field has been removed from the `ad.o_prime_2` expression in `fn3()`.",

The `ad.o_prime_1` variable is assigned the value of 5, which is the return value of `fn1()`, and then it is assigned the value of 0. This means that the first assignment can be optimized out, and the variable `ad.o_prime_1` can be directly assigned the value of 0.\n\nThe `t_high` variable is not used in the program, so it has been removed from the program.\n\nThe `s` variable is a static variable, which means that its value is preserved across function calls.
