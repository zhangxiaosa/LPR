Constant Propagation:\nThe variable `j_hi` is assigned the constant value `0x24F96B7B` and is never modified later in the program.

Since `g` is not modified later in the program, the value of `n` can be replaced with its value in the `if` statement.\n\nThe optimized program is as follows:\n```\nint g;\nint fn1() {\n  long j_hi = 0x24F96B7B;\n  unsigned k;\n  for (int f; f;)\n    for (; j_hi; --j_hi)\n      ;\n  long n = g;\n  unsigned o = n;\n  unsigned p = o;\nq:;\n  k = k >> 1;\n  if (p) {\n    k = k << j_hi;\n    goto q;\n  }\n}\nint main() {}\n```\nIn this optimized program, the variable `j_hi` is assigned the constant value `0x24F96B7B` and is used directly in the `if` statement.

Constant propagation: The variable `j_hi` is assigned the constant value `0x24F96B7B`, so the for loop `for(; j_hi; --j_hi)` is replaced with `for(; 0x24F96B7B; --0x24F96B7B)`. This optimization reduces the number of instructions in the loop.\n2. Copy propagation: The variable `n` is assigned the value of `g`, which is a global variable. Since `g` is not modified within the function, its value can be used directly instead of assigning it to a new variable `n`. This optimization reduces the number of instructions and reduces the number of variables.\n3. Dead code elimination: The variable `o` is assigned the value of `n`, but it is not used anywhere else in the function. Therefore, the assignment can be removed, and the variable `o` can be eliminated.\n4. Unused variable elimination: The variable `p` is assigned the value of `o`, but it is not used anywhere else in the function.
