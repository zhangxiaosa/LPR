I have also removed the typedefs for these types, as they are not necessary in this program.\n\nNote that I have also removed the `signed` keyword from the declaration of `i`, as it is not necessary in this context. The `signed` keyword is only necessary when you want to explicitly specify that a variable is signed, such as in the declaration of `i` in the original program. However, in the optimized program, the default signedness of the `int` type is used, which is signed.\n\nI hope this helps!
