This is because `g` is not used in the program and can be safely removed without affecting the program's functionality. Additionally, I have changed the data type of the variable `j_hi` from `long` to `int` because it is not necessary to use a larger data type for this variable.",

This is because the compiler can represent the range of values that can be stored in an `int` using a `long` data type, and the `long` data type is more efficient for performing arithmetic operations.\n\nAdditionally, the data type `unsigned` has been replaced with the `long` data type to ensure that the resulting value is always positive. This is because the `unsigned` data type can represent negative values, which are not necessary in this program.\n\nFinally, the `goto` statement has been replaced with a loop in order to eliminate the use of a label. This is a good practice in programming because it makes the code easier to read and understand, and it also allows the compiler to optimize the code more effectively.",
