The struct `c` has four members: `d`, `e`, `f`, and `g`. `d` is a signed integer with 18 bits, `e` and `f` are unsigned integers, and `g` is also a signed integer.\n\nTo decompose the variable `j` into its primary data types, we can extract the individual members of `j` and assign them to new variables with the same data types.\n\nHere's an example of how to do that for the variable `e`:\n```\nint main() {\n  struct c j;\n  int e = j.e;\n  i.g = j.h && e;\n}\n```\nIn this version of the program, we've extracted the `e` member of `j` and assigned it to a new variable `e`. We've also modified the line `i.g = j.h && j.e;` to use the new variable `e` instead of the original `j.e`.\n\nBy doing this, we've decomposed the complex data type `struct c` into its primitive data types and simplified the program. We've also made it easier to understand and modify the program, as we can now work with each variable independently.",
