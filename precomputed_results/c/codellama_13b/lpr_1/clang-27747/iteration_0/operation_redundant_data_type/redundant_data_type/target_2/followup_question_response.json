This is because the `int` type is the default integer type in C, and it is implicitly signed. Therefore, the `signed` and `unsigned` modifiers are not needed.\n\nAdditionally, the `p` variable in `fn1()` is declared as `int` instead of `signed int`. This is because the result of the expression `o | -(l.f && l.d) - n` is an integer value, and it is not necessary to specify the signedness of the variable.\n\nOverall, this modification of the program eliminates the use of the `signed` and `unsigned` data types and makes the code more concise and readable.",
