This eliminates the need for creating a separate variable `n` and simplifies the expression `i.h_low = l.h_low | -(165 && l.h_low) - n;` to `i.h_low = h_low | -(165 && h_low)`.",

This allows the compiler to inline the function and eliminate the function call overhead.\n\nThe inlining optimization is done by the compiler's inlining heuristics. The heuristics determine which functions are suitable for inlining and which are not. The heuristics can include factors such as the size of the function, the number of calls to the function, the complexity of the function, and the number of parameters passed to the function.\n\nInlining can also be done manually by the programmer using the `inline` keyword in C++. However, it is important to note that inlining can have a negative impact on the code size and performance if not done correctly.",
