The program then defines two instances of `struct c_new`, `i` and `j`, and modifies the value of `i.h_low` based on the values of `j.h_low` and `l.h_low`.\n\nTo optimize the program, we can eliminate the use of `struct c_new` and replace it with the primitive data type `int`. This will simplify the program and make it more efficient, as it will no longer require the creation and management of a separate data structure.\n\nHere is the optimized program:\n```\nint i, j;\n\nint main() {\n  int l = j;\n  int n = j && l;\n  i = l | -(165 && l) - n;\n}\n```\nIn this optimized program, the variables `i`, `j`, and `l` are all of type `int`, and the program performs the same operations as the original program.

There is no instance of struct c_new that needs to be eliminated or substituted.\n\nHowever, if you are looking to eliminate the use of the struct c_new and replace it with a different data type, you can use the following code:\n```\nint i, j;\nint main() {\n  int h_low;\n  h_low = j;\n  int n = j && h_low;\n  i = h_low | -(165 && h_low) - n;\n}\n```\nThis code eliminates the use of the struct c_new and replaces it with an integer variable h_low.
