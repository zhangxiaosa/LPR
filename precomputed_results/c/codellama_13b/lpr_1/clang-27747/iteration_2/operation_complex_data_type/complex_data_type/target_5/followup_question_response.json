The variable `i` and `j` are also of type `struct c_new`, but they are not used in this program.\n\nThe target to be optimized is `struct c_new l`, which means that we want to optimize the `struct c_new` type itself. To do this, we need to decompose the `struct c_new` type into its primary data type components, which in this case are `int h` and `int g`.\n\nHere is the decompose program:\n```\nstruct c_new {\n  int h : 18;\n  int g;\n} i, j;\n\nint main() {\n  struct c_new l;\n  int h = j.h;\n  int n = h && l.h;\n  int p = h | -(165 && h) - n;\n  i.g = p;\n}\n```\nIn this decompose program, we have created two new variables `h` and `n` to store the values of the `h` and `n` members of the `struct c_new` type. These variables are used to perform the calculations in the program and to store the results.\n\nThe optimized program is the same as the original program, but with the addition of the two new variables `h` and `n`. These variables can be used to optimize the program by reducing the number of operations and the amount of memory accesses.\n\nFor example, in the original program, the expression `j.h` is used multiple times, which means that the value of `j.h` is being calculated multiple times. By using the new variable `h`, we can avoid this redundancy and calculate the value of `j.h` only once. This can improve the performance of the program.\n\nSimilarly, the expression `l.h && j.h` is used multiple times in the original program, which means that the value of `l.h && j.h` is being calculated multiple times. By using the new variable `n`, we can avoid this redundancy and calculate the value of `l.h && j.h` only once. This can improve the performance of the program.\n\nOverall, the optimized program is the same as the original program, but with the addition of the two new variables `h` and `n`. These variables can be used to optimize the program by reducing the number of operations and the amount of memory accesses.",
