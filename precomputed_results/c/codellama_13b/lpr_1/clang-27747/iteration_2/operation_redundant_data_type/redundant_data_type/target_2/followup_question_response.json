This allows the program to use the `struct c` type directly, without having to define a new type `struct c_new`.\n\nAdditionally, the bitfield declaration for the `h` member of the `struct c` type has been simplified to just `int h : 18;`, which is equivalent to the original declaration `int h : 18:18;`. This is because the default bitfield size is the same as the number of bits specified in the declaration, so the `18:18` part is not necessary.",
