It has a single member variable named \"h\" of type `int` with a width of 18 bits.\n\nTo eliminate `struct c_new` and substitute every instance of it with its associated original data type, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Define a new data type `c_new` with a single member variable `h` of type `int` with a width of 18 bits.\n```\nstruct c_new {\n  int h : 18;\n} i, j;\n```\n2. Replace every instance of `struct c_new` with `c_new`.\n```\nc_new l;\nl.h = j.h;\nint n = j.h && l.h;\nint p = l.h | -(165 && l.h) - n;\ni.h = p;\n```\n3. Replace every instance of `struct` with `int` to make the program more readable.\n```\nc_new l;\nl.h = j.h;\nint n = j.h && l.h;\nint p = l.h | -(165 && l.h) - n;\ni.h = p;\n```\n4. Replace every instance of `&&` with `&`.\n```\nc_new l;\nl.h = j.h;\nint n = j.h & l.h;\nint p = l.h | -(165 & l.h) - n;\ni.h = p;\n```\n5. Replace every instance of `-` with `~`.\n```\nc_new l;\nl.h = j.h;\nint n = j.h & l.h;\nint p = l.h | ~(165 & l.h) - n;\ni.h = p;\n```\n6. Remove the unnecessary parentheses.\n```\nc_new l;\nl.h = j.h;\nint n = j.h & l.h;\nint p = l.h | ~165 & l.h - n;\ni.h = p;\n```\nTherefore, the optimized program without the use of `struct c_new` is:\n```\nint l;\nl.h = j.h;\nint n = j.h & l.h;\nint p = l.h | ~165 & l.h - n;\ni.h = p;\n```",

The program consists of a single function `main`, which initializes a variable `l` of type `int` and assigns `j.h` to it. It then performs bitwise operations on `l` and `n` and assigns the result to `p`. Finally, it assigns `p` to `i.h`.\n\nThe program can be optimized by eliminating the custom data type `struct c_new` and substituting every instance of it with its associated original data type, which is `int`. This can be done by replacing `struct c_new` with `int` throughout the program, as well as replacing `l` with `int`. The resulting program is:\n```\nint i, j;\n\nint main() {\n  int l;\n  l = j;\n  int n = j && l;\n  int p = l | -(165 && l) - n;\n  i = p;\n}\n```\nThis optimized program is more concise and easier to understand, as it uses the built-in data type `int` instead of a custom data type.",

The `int` data type is used to represent the custom data type `struct c_new` defined by the programmer. The `int` data type has a width of 32 bits, which is the same as the width of the `int` data type in the original program.\n\nSince the `struct c_new` data type is replaced with `int`, the `l.h` and `n` variables are no longer needed. The `l` variable is replaced with `int l`, and the `n` variable is replaced with `int n`. The `p` variable is also replaced with `int p`.\n\nThe `j.h` variable is replaced with `j`. The `&&` operator is replaced with `&&`. The `-(165 && l) - n` expression is replaced with `-(165 && l) - n`. The `i.h` variable is replaced with `i`.\n\nThe resulting program is a valid C program that is equivalent to the original program, but with the `struct c_new` data type replaced with `int`.",
