Therefore, we can safely optimize it out by removing the variable declaration and the corresponding assignment.\n\nThe optimized program is:\n```\nstruct c_new {\n  int h_low : 18;\n} i, j;\nint main() {\n  struct c_new l;\n  l.h_low = j.h_low;\n  int p = l.h_low | -(165 && l.h_low);\n  i.h_low = p;\n}\n```\nThe constant propagation optimization can also be applied to the program by replacing the expression `165 && l.h_low` with `165`, since `l.h_low` is a constant with a value of 18. The optimized program with constant propagation is:\n```\nstruct c_new {\n  int h_low : 18;\n} i, j;\nint main() {\n  struct c_new l;\n  l.h_low = j.h_low;\n  int p = l.h_low | -(165);\n  i.h_low = p;\n}\n```\nThe copy propagation optimization can also be applied to the program by replacing the expression `l.h_low` with `j.h_low`, since `l.h_low` is assigned the value of `j.h_low` at the beginning of the program. The optimized program with copy propagation is:\n```\nstruct c_new {\n  int h_low : 18;\n} i, j;\nint main() {\n  struct c_new l;\n  l.h_low = j.h_low;\n  int p = j.h_low | -(165);\n  i.h_low = p;\n}\n```",

In this case, the expression is a logical AND operation between two bits, which can be evaluated as a boolean value. Since `j.h_low` is not modified in the code, its value is constant and can be substituted directly into the expression.\n\nThe resulting expression is `l.h_low | -(165 && l.h_low) - (l.h_low && l.h_low)` which is equivalent to `l.h_low | -(165 && l.h_low) - l.h_low` and can be further simplified to `l.h_low | -165`.\n\nThe final optimized program is:\n```\nstruct c_new {\n  int h_low : 18;\n} i, j;\nint main() {\n  struct c_new l;\n  l.h_low = j.h_low;\n  int p = l.h_low | -165;\n  i.h_low = p;\n}\n```",
