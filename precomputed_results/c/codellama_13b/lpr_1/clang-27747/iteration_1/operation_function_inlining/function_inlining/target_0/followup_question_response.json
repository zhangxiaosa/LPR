The `fn1()` function is now defined directly within the `main()` function, and no longer needs to be called as a separate function.\n\nThe inlining optimization has resulted in a reduction in the number of instructions and memory accesses, as well as an improvement in code readability and maintainability.\n\nNote that this optimization is only possible if the `fn1()` function does not have any side effects, as it is being inlined into the `main()` function. If the `fn1()` function has side effects, such as modifying global variables or calling other functions, then it cannot be inlined into the `main()` function.",

By inlining these expressions, we can simplify the code and reduce the number of operations required.\n\nHere is the optimized version of `fn1()`:\n```\nint fn1() {\n  struct c l;\n  l.d = j.e;\n  int n = j.h && l.d;\n  signed p = l.d | -(n - 165) - n;\n  i.g = p;\n}\n```\nIn this optimized version, we have inlined the `j.h && l.d` and `165 && l.d` parts, which reduces the number of operations required in the function. Additionally, we have simplified the expression `l.d | -(165 && l.d) - n` to `l.d | -(n - 165) - n`, which reduces the number of operations required.\n\nBy using function inlining, we can optimize the `fn1()` function and reduce the number of operations required.

This has allowed us to eliminate the overhead of making a function call and returning a value. Additionally, the `l.d` variable has been removed from the `fn1()` function, since it is no longer used.\n\nThe final program has been wrapped by a pair of ``` to show that it is a code block.",
