However, the variable `l` is also explicitly defined as a struct of type `c`, which implies that the type of `l` is `struct c`.\n\nTo optimize the program, we can eliminate the explicit definition of `l` as a struct of type `c` and replace every instance of `l` with its associated original data type, which is `struct c`. This will allow us to access the members of the struct directly, without having to use the dot operator.\n\nHere is the optimized program:\n```\nstruct c {\n  int d;\n  int e;\n  unsigned f;\n};\n\nint main() {\n  struct c l = {24, 6738, 165};\n  l.d = j_e;\n  int n = j_h && l.d;\n  i_g = l.d | -(l.f && l.d) - n;\n}\n```\nIn this optimized program, the variable `l` is defined as a struct of type `c`, and its members `d`, `e`, and `f` are accessed directly without using the dot operator.
