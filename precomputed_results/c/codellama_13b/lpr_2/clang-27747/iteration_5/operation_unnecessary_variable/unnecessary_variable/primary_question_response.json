However, this variable is only used once in the program, so it can be eliminated and the result of the `&&` operation can be directly assigned to `i`.\n2. `l` is a struct variable that is declared and initialized within the `main` function. However, since it is not used outside of the function, it can be optimized away.\n\nTherefore, the optimized program would be:\n```\nint j;\nint i;\nint main() {\n  struct {\n    int d : 18;\n    int f;\n  } l = {24, 165};\n  l.d = j;\n  i = l.d | -(l.f && l.d);\n}\n```",
