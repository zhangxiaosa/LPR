The type of `l` is a structure with three members, and the type of each member is an integer.\n\nTo optimize the access to the member `d` of `l`, we can decompose it into three variables: `d`, `e`, and `f`.\n```\nint main() {\n  int j;\n  int i;\n  int m;\n  int d;\n  int e;\n  int f;\n  d = 24;\n  e = 6738;\n  f = 165;\n  l.d = j;\n  m = j && l.d;\n  i = l.d | -(l.f && l.d) - m;\n}\n```\nIn this way, we can optimize the access to the member `d` of `l` by using the variable `d` directly instead of accessing it through the structure `l`.",

The `d1` variable is the least significant 18 bits of the `l.d` variable, the `d2` variable is the next 18 bits, and the `d3` variable is the most significant 18 bits.\n\nThe optimized program is equivalent to the original program, but it has the advantage of being easier to analyze and modify.

The other variables (`e` and `f`) are no longer used in the program.\n\nIt is important to note that the decomposition of `l.d` is not the only possible way to optimize the program. Other possible optimizations may include changing the data types of the variables, or reorganizing the code to reduce the number of operations performed. The goal of optimization is to make the program run more efficiently and efficiently, while still producing the same output.",
