The program also defines two structures of type `c` called `i` and `j`.\n\nTo decompose the program into variables with primary data types, we need to identify the data types of each variable and break it down into smaller variables that are of primary data types.\n\nThe `c` structure consists of the following variables:\n\n* `d` of type `int`\n* `e` of type `unsigned`\n* `f` of type `unsigned`\n* `g` of type `int`\n* `h` of type `int`\n\nThe program also defines two structures of type `c` called `i` and `j`, which are used in the function `fn1()`.\n\nIn the function `fn1()`, the following steps are performed:\n\n* A structure of type `c` is created with the values `24`, `6738`, and `165` for the variables `d`, `e`, and `f`.\n* The value of `j.e` is assigned to a variable `m`.\n* The value of `m` is assigned to `l.d`.\n* The value of `j.h` is assigned to a variable `n`.\n* The value of `l.d` is assigned to a variable `o`.\n* The value of `o` is assigned to a variable `p` after applying some arithmetic operations.\n* The value of `p` is assigned to `i.g`.\n\nTo optimize the program, we need to focus on the variable `e`, which is of type `unsigned`. The program is written in C programming language, which allows us to perform operations on variables of different data types.\n\nTo optimize the program, we can use the following techniques:\n\n* Use of bitwise operators: The program uses bitwise operators `&&` and `|` to perform operations on the variables. We can use bitwise operators to perform operations on `e` and other variables to reduce the number of operations.\n* Use of bit shift operators: The program uses bit shift operators to perform operations on the variables. We can use bit shift operators to reduce the number of operations.\n* Use of arithmetic operators: The program uses arithmetic operators `+` and `-` to perform operations on the variables. We can use arithmetic operators to reduce the number of operations.\n* Use of logical operators: The program uses logical operators `&&` and `||` to perform operations on the variables. We can use logical operators to reduce the number of operations.\n\nBy applying these techniques, we can reduce the number of operations performed in the program and optimize the execution time of the program.",
