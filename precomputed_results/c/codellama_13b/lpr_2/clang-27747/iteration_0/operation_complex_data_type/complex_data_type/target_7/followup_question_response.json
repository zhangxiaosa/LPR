This is because `n` is not used anywhere else in the program, and it is just a temporary variable that is created to store the result of the expression `j_h && l.d`. By using `l.d` directly, we can avoid the creation of this temporary variable and simplify the code.\n\nAdditionally, we have also removed the variable `o` and replaced it with `l.d`. This is because `o` is not used anywhere else in the program, and it is just a temporary variable that is created to store the result of the expression `l.d`. By using `l.d` directly, we can avoid the creation of this temporary variable and simplify the code.\n\nFinally, we have also removed the variable `p` and replaced it with the expression `l.d | -(l.f && l.d)`.
