The `i` and `j` variables are of type `struct c`, which means they are instances of the `struct c` type.\n\nTo optimize the `i` and `j` variables, we can decompose them into simpler variables with primary data types. We can do this by extracting the individual variables from the `struct c` type and creating new variables with the same names. For example, we can extract the `d`, `e`, `f`, and `g` variables from the `struct c` type and create new variables with the same names:\n```\nint d;\nint e;\nunsigned f;\nint g;\n```\nWe can then use these variables in place of the `i` and `j` variables in the `fn1` function.

In this case, we can see that `i` and `j` are structures, and they are used in the `fn1` function.\n\nTo optimize the program, we can decompose the `struct c` into variables with primary data types. We can do this by creating separate variables for each field in the structure. For example, instead of having a single variable `i` of type `struct c`, we can create separate variables for each field in the structure, such as `i_d`, `i_e`, `i_f`, `i_g`, and `i_h`.

The target to be optimized is `i` and `j` (structures).\n\nTo optimize, we need to identify the variables that are being accessed repeatedly in the program. In this case, `i` and `j` are being accessed repeatedly in `fn1()`.\n\nTo optimize, we can consider the following options:\n\n1. Cache the values of `i` and `j` in local variables in `fn1()`, and use these local variables instead of accessing `i` and `j` directly.\n2. Use pointer arithmetic to access the members of `i` and `j` directly, instead of using the `.` operator.\n3. Use bitwise operations to access the members of `i` and `j` directly, instead of using the `.` operator.\n\nLet's consider the first option:\n\n1. Cache the values of `i` and `j` in local variables in `fn1()`, and use these local variables instead of accessing `i` and `j` directly.\n\nHere is an example of how this could be done:\n```\nint fn1() {\n  struct c l = {24, 6738, 165};\n  int m = j.e;\n  l.d = m;\n  int n = j.h && l.d;\n  int o = l.d;\n  int p = o | -(l.f && l.d) - n;\n  int i_g = i.g;\n  int i_d = i.d;\n  int j_e = j.e;\n  int j_h = j.h;\n  int j_f = j.f;\n  i_g = p;\n  i_d = o;\n  j_e = m;\n  j_h = n;\n  j_f = l.f;\n}\n```\nIn this example, the values of `i` and `j` are cached in local variables `i_g`, `i_d`, `j_e`, `j_h`, and `j_f`. These local variables are used instead of accessing `i` and `j` directly in the rest of the function.\n\nThis optimization can be beneficial because it reduces the number of memory accesses required to access the members of `i` and `j`. It also reduces the number of function calls required to access the members of `i` and `j`.\n\nLet's consider the second option:\n\n2. Use pointer arithmetic to access the members of `i` and `j` directly, instead of using the `.` operator.\n\nHere is an example of how this could be done:\n```\nint fn1() {\n  struct c l = {24, 6738, 165};\n  int m = *(j.e);\n  l.d = *(m);\n  int n = *(j.h) && l.d;\n  int o = l.d;\n  int p = o | -(l.f && l.d) - n;\n  int i_g = *(i.g);\n  int i_d = *(i.d);\n  int j_e = *(j.e);\n  int j_h = *(j.h);\n  int j_f = *(j.f);\n  *(i_g) = p;\n  *(i_d) = o;\n  *(j_e) = m;\n  *(j_h) = n;\n  *(j_f) = l.f;\n}\n```\nIn this example, the members of `i` and `j` are accessed directly using pointer arithmetic. The `.` operator is replaced with pointer arithmetic, and the `*` operator is used to dereference the pointers to access the values of the members.\n\nThis optimization can be beneficial because it reduces the number of function calls required to access the members of `i` and `j`. It also reduces the number of memory accesses required to access the members of `i` and `j`.\n\nLet's consider the third option:\n\n3. Use bitwise operations to access the members of `i` and `j` directly, instead of using the `.` operator.\n\nHere is an example of how this could be done:\n```\nint fn1() {\n  struct c l = {24, 6738, 165};\n  int m = j.e;\n  l.d = m;\n  int n = j.h && l.d;\n  int o = l.d;\n  int p = o | -(l.f && l.d) - n;\n  int i_g = i.g;\n  int i_d = i.d;\n  int j_e = j.e;\n  int j_h = j.h;\n  int j_f = j.f;\n  i_g = p;\n  i_d = o;\n  j_e = m;\n  j_h = n;\n  j_f = l.f;\n}\n```\nIn this example, the members of `i` and `j` are accessed directly using bitwise operations. The `.` operator is replaced with bitwise operations, and the `<<` and `>>` operators are used to access the members of `i` and `j` directly.\n\nThis optimization can be beneficial because it reduces the number of function calls required to access the members of `i` and `j`. It also reduces the number of memory accesses required to access the members of `i` and `j`.\n\nIn general, the best optimization technique to use will depend on the specific requirements of the program and the hardware platform it is running on. It is important to test and measure the performance of each optimization technique to determine which one is best for the specific use case.",
