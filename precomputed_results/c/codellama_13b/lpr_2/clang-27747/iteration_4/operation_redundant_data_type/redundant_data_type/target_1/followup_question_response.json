The `struct` was used to store three integer values in a single variable, which is not necessary in this program. By replacing the `struct` with separate `int` variables, the program becomes more readable and easier to understand.\n\nAlso, by using the `|` operator to combine the values of `d`, `f`, and `d`, the program becomes more efficient and easier to understand, as the `|` operator is used to compute the bitwise OR of the three values.\n\nOverall, the optimized program is more readable and efficient than the original program.",
