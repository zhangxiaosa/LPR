In `fn12()`, the `w` variable is initialized to 3 and it is decremented in each iteration of the loop. Since the loop only executes for `w` iterations, the value of `w` can be constant-propagated to 3.\n2. In `fn12()`, the variable `an` is initialized to 250UL and it is assigned a value in each iteration of the loop. Since the value of `an` is always 250UL, it can be copy-propagated to `an = 250UL` outside the loop.\n3. In `fn12()`, the `if` statement checks if `an == 294A85636008822DLL` and assigns `p2` a value based on the result of the comparison. Since the comparison is always true, the `if` statement can be removed and the value of `p2` can be directly assigned `an = w` outside the loop.\n4. In `fn12()`, the `short ao = 0xBCD1L` statement can be removed since it is not used anywhere in the function.\n5. In `fn13()`, the `fn10()` function is called with `v` and `t` as arguments, but the values of `v` and `t` are not used in `fn10()`. The function can be optimized out since it does not have any side effects.\n6. In `main()`, the `fn13()` function is called, but the return value is not used. The function can be optimized out since it does not have any side effects.\n\nAfter applying these optimizations, the program is simplified and the code size is reduced. The optimized program is as follows:\n```\nint fn2(int p1, int p2) { return p1 - p2; }\nint fn3(int p1, int p2) { return p1 - p2; }\nunsigned char fn4(unsigned p1, unsigned p2) { return p1; }\nint fn5(int p1, int p2) { return p2; }\nint fn6(int p1, int p2) { return p1 - p2; }\nshort p;\nshort t;\nint v;\nchar w;\nint ab;\nshort ac = 1L;\nshort fn10(int, short);\nshort fn12(short, short, short, short, int);\nint fn13() {\n  fn12(2L, 248UL, 250UL, 1, 3);\n  return 0;\n}\nshort fn12(short p1, short p2, short p3, short p4, int p5) {\n  short al = 3L;\n  int am = 1L;\n  short an;\n  for (w = 3; w; w -= 1)\n    if (an = 250UL) {\n      p2 = fn5(ab, ac) || (an = w) == 0x294A85636008822DLL;\n      if (fn2(fn3(0xBCD1L, fn4(fn6(am, an), 0xECL)), p2) & 1UL)\n        v = 1UL;\n    }\n  return al;\n}\nint main() {\n  fn13();\n  p = v;\n  printf(\"checksum = %X\\n\", p);\n  return 0;\n}\n```",
