The result is then cast to an unsigned char, which is the return type of the `fn4` function.\n\nBy inlining this function, we have eliminated the need for a function call, which can improve the performance of the program. Additionally, the inlined function allows the compiler to optimize the code further, as the resulting code is simpler and easier to analyze.",
