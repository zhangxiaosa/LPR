This function can be optimized by inlining it and eliminating the unnecessary parameter and return value. Here is the modified version of the function:\n```\nvoid fn9(g p1, char *p2, int p3) {\n  p = p1;\n}\n```\nThis modification eliminates the need for a separate function call and replaces it with a direct assignment to the global variable `p`.

Here is the optimized version of `fn7`:\n```\nvoid fn7(b p1) {\n  p = p1;\n}\n```\nThis version of the function is simpler and more efficient, as it only has a single line of code that assigns the value of `p1` to `p`.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the optimization may not be significant in this case, as the function is very short and simple.
