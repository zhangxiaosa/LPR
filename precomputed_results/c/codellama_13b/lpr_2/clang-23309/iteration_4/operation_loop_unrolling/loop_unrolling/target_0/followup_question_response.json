The loop now executes three iterations, rather than continuing to run until `w` becomes zero. This optimization is possible because the loop body is small and the loop variable `w` is never used outside of the loop.\n\nThe loop body has also been modified to use a constant value for the loop variable `w` instead of the original variable `w`. This constant value is computed outside of the loop and is used to replace the variable `w` inside the loop body.\n\nAdditionally, the loop body has been modified to use a conditional expression instead of an if-statement. This is possible because the loop body is small and the condition is always true.\n\nOverall, this optimization reduces the number of instructions executed in the loop body and allows the loop to be optimized out by the compiler.",
