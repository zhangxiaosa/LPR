This has resulted in the removal of the `fn4` function and the corresponding function call.\n\nThe inlining of the `fn4` function was possible because the function only contains a single statement, which is the return statement. Inlining functions with single statements can be considered safe, as the function body is replaced with the single statement in the code, which does not affect the functionality of the program.\n\nAfter inlining the `fn4` function, the resulting code is shorter and more efficient, which can result in better performance. However, it's important to note that the optimization should not be done without proper testing and analysis to ensure that the resulting code is correct and does not affect the functionality of the program.",
