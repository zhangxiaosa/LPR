The program uses the following typedefs:\n\n* `typedef int b;`\n* `typedef long c;`\n* `typedef unsigned d;`\n* `typedef unsigned e;`\n* `typedef unsigned f;`\n* `typedef unsigned g;`\n\nThe program also defines a struct called `struct h` with three members: `signed i`, `c j`, and `unsigned k`.\n\nThe program has two functions: `fn1` and `fn2`. `fn1` takes five arguments: `f p1`, `short p2`, `g p3`, `d p4`, and `struct h p5`. `fn2` takes one argument: `p1`.\n\nThe program has a global variable called `l` of type `d`.\n\nThe target to be optimized is `b`.\n\nTo eliminate the typedefs and substitute every instance of the typedefs with their associated original data types, we can simply replace each typedef with the type it is aliasing. For example, `b` becomes `int`, `c` becomes `long`, `d` becomes `unsigned`, `e` becomes `unsigned`, `f` becomes `unsigned`, and `g` becomes `unsigned`.\n\nHere is the modified program with the typedefs eliminated and the types substituted:\n```\nint main() {}\n\nint fn1(int p1, short p2, unsigned p3, unsigned p4, struct h p5) {\n  p5.k;\nw:;\n  goto w;\n}\n\nunsigned fn2(int p1) {\n  struct h p;\n  int q;\n  fn1(q, l, p1, 3, p);\n  while (1) {\n    struct h r;\n    p = r = p;\n  }\n}\n\nstruct h {\n  signed i;\n  long j;\n  unsigned k;\n};\n\nunsigned l;\n```\nNote that the `typedef` statements have been removed, and the types have been replaced with their original names.",
