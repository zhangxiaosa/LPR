For example, p1, p2, p3, and p4 are used as parameters to the fn1 function, which suggests that they are unsigned. Similarly, q is used as a parameter to the fn1 function, which suggests that it is an int. The same can be said for l, which is used as a parameter to the fn2 function.\n\nThe type of the variables in the program can also be determined by looking at the function signatures. For example, the fn1 function takes an unsigned parameter and returns a struct h, which suggests that the type of the parameter is unsigned and the type of the return value is struct h. Similarly, the fn2 function takes an unsigned parameter and returns an unsigned value, which suggests that the type of the parameter is unsigned and the type of the return value is unsigned.\n\nBy analyzing the program in this way, we can determine that the target variable to be optimized is unsigned.",
