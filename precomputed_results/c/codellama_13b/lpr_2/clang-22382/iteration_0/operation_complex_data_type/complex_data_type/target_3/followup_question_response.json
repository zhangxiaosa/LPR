Function `fn1` can be decomposed into four variables with primary data type: `unsigned`, `short`, `unsigned`, and `unsigned`.\n4. Function `fn2` can be decomposed into one variable with primary data type: `unsigned`.\n5. Variable `p` in function `fn1` can be decomposed into three variables with primary data type: `unsigned`, `short`, and `unsigned`.\n6. Variable `q` in function `fn2` can be decomposed into one variable with primary data type: `unsigned`.\n7. Variable `r` in function `fn2` can be decomposed into one variable with primary data type: `struct h`.\n8. Variable `p5` in function `fn1` can be decomposed into three variables with primary data type: `unsigned`, `short`, and `unsigned`.\n\nTherefore, the decomposed variables with primary data type are:\n\n* `int`\n* `long`\n* `int`\n* `unsigned`\n* `short`\n* `unsigned`\n* `unsigned`\n* `unsigned`\n* `struct h`\n* `unsigned`\n\nThe optimized code can be written as:\n```\nstruct h {\n  int i;\n  long j;\n  int k;\n};\n\nunsigned l;\n\nstruct h fn1(unsigned p1, short p2, unsigned p3, unsigned p4, struct h p5) {\n  p5.k;\nw:;\n  goto w;\n}\n\nunsigned fn2(unsigned p1) {\n  struct h p;\n  int q;\n  fn1(q, l, p1, 3, p);\n  while (1) {\n    struct h r;\n    p = r = p;\n  }\n}\n\nint main() {}\n```\nNote that the `short` variable has been optimized by decomposing it into three variables with primary data type.",
