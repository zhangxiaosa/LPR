The `struct` keyword is used to define the structure, and the members of the structure are accessed using the dot operator (e.g., `struct.i`).\n\nNote that the `fn1` function still has the `struct` parameter, but it is not necessary to specify the type of the parameter because it is already defined in the function definition. The `fn2` function also has the `struct` variable, but it is not necessary to specify the type of the variable because it is already defined in the function definition.",

This is because the `struct h` data type only has three members, which are all of type `long`. By using the `long` data type directly, we can eliminate the overhead of creating and passing around the `struct h` data type.\n\nWe have also eliminated the `fn2` function, which was only used to call the `fn1` function and set the `p` variable to the result of the `fn1` function. By inlining the `fn1` function directly into the `fn2` function, we can eliminate the overhead of calling a function and can simplify the program.\n\nFinally, we have eliminated the `main` function, which was empty and not used in the program. By removing this function, we can simplify the program and make it more efficient.",

The struct h data type is defined as follows:\n```\nstruct h {\n  long i;\n  long j;\n  long k;\n};\n```\nThe struct h data type can be optimized by eliminating the redundancy in the program. The program can be optimized by using the following steps:\n\n1. Replace the struct h data type with individual data types:\n```\nstruct h {\n  long i;\n  long j;\n  long k;\n};\n```\ncan be replaced with:\n```\nstruct h {\n  long i;\n  long j;\n  long k;\n};\n```\n2. Eliminate the redundant data type:\n```\nstruct h p;\n```\ncan be eliminated and replaced with:\n```\nlong i;\nlong j;\nlong k;\n```\n3. Eliminate the redundant variable:\n```\nstruct h r;\n```\ncan be eliminated and replaced with:\n```\nlong i;\nlong j;\nlong k;\n```\n4. Eliminate the redundant function:\n```\nstatic struct h fn1(struct h p) {\n  while (1)\n    p.k;\n}\n```\ncan be eliminated and replaced with:\n```\nstatic void fn1(long k) {\n  while (1)\n    k;\n}\n```\n5. Eliminate the redundant loop:\n```\nwhile (1) {\n  struct h r;\n  p = r = p;\n}\n```\ncan be eliminated and replaced with:\n```\nwhile (1) {\n  long i;\n  long j;\n  long k;\n  i = j = k;\n}\n```\nThe optimized program is:\n```\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nstruct h {\n  long i;\n  long j;\n  long k;\n};\n\nstatic void fn1(long k) {\n  while (1)\n    k;\n}\n\nunsigned fn2() {\n  long i;\n  long j;\n  long k;\n  while (1) {\n    i = j = k;\n  }\n}\n\nint main() {}\n```\nThe optimized program eliminates the redundancy in the program by using the struct h data type to store the values of i, j, and k.",
