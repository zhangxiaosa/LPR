This is because `long` is not a standard C data type and is not guaranteed to be supported by all compilers. Using `int` instead is a more portable solution.",

Therefore, the program can be optimized by eliminating it and substituting every instance of it with its associated original data type, which is `int`.\n\nIn the `struct h` definition, the members `i`, `j`, and `k` are all of type `long`, but they can be changed to `int` without affecting the functionality of the program.\n\nIn the `fn1()` function, the parameter `p` is of type `struct h`, which is a structure that contains `int` members, so the function can be modified to accept an `int` parameter instead of a `struct h` parameter.\n\nIn the `fn2()` function, the variable `p` is of type `struct h`, and it is assigned to a variable `r` of type `struct h`. Since `struct h` is defined with `int` members, these assignments can be changed to assignments between `int` variables.\n\nIn the `main()` function, there is no instance of `long` in the program, so it can be left as-is.\n\nAfter these modifications, the optimized program looks like this:\n```\nstruct h {\n  int i;\n  int j;\n  int k;\n};\n\nstatic struct h fn1(int p) {\n  while (1)\n    p.k;\n}\n\nunsigned fn2() {\n  int p;\n  fn1(p);\n  while (1) {\n    int r;\n    p = r = p;\n  }\n}\n\nint main() {}\n```\nThis optimized program has eliminated all instances of `long` and substituted them with `int`. The program still has the same functionality as the original program, but it is optimized for better performance.",
