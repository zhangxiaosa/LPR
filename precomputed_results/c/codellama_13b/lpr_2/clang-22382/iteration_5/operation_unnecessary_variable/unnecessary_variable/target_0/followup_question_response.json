The variable `k` has been moved from the `struct h` to the `fn1` function, so the `fn1` function now takes a `long` parameter instead of a `struct h`. The `fn2` function has been modified to call `fn1` with the `struct h` parameter `p` instead of calling `fn1` with the `struct h` parameter `r`. The `main` function has been modified to call `fn1` with the `struct h` parameter `p` instead of calling `fn1` with the `struct h` parameter `r`.\n\nThe optimization has been done by constant propagation and copy propagation. In the original program, the variable `i` was never used, so it was optimized out. In the original program, the variable `j` was never used, so it was optimized out. In the original program, the variable `k` was used in the `fn1` function, so it was moved to the `fn1` function to reduce the number of parameters. In the original program, the `fn2` function had a statement `p = r = p`, which is equivalent to `p = r`, so it was optimized out. In the original program, the `main` function had a statement `p = r = p`, which is equivalent to `p = r`, so it was optimized out.",

The variable `i` was unused and therefore not required.\n\nConstant propagation can be used to optimize out constant variables. If a variable is assigned a value that is never changed, and that value is used only in a single expression, then the variable can be optimized out and the value can be used directly in the expression.\n\nIn this case, the variable `i` is assigned the value 0 in the `struct h` definition, but it is never used in any expressions. Therefore, it can be optimized out and the value 0 can be used directly in the `struct h` definition.\n\nCopy propagation can be used to optimize out unnecessary copies of variables. If a variable is copied from one location to another, but the value of the variable is never changed, then the copy can be optimized out and the original variable can be used directly.\n\nIn this case, the variable `p` is copied from the `struct h` parameter to the local variable `r` in the `fn2` function. However, the value of `p` is never changed, so the copy can be optimized out and the original `p` can be used directly in the function.\n\nOverall, both constant propagation and copy propagation were used to optimize out unnecessary variables and expressions in this program. The resulting program is more efficient and easier to understand.",
