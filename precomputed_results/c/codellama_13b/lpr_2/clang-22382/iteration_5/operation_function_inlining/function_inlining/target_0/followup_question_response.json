This allows the compiler to avoid the overhead of calling a function and instead directly perform the operations inside the function.\n\nNote that in order to inline a function, the function must be defined in the same translation unit as the function that is calling it. In this case, both `fn1` and `fn2` are defined in the same translation unit, so inlining is possible. If the functions were defined in separate translation units, inlining would not be possible.",

This means that the code for `fn1` is copied directly into `fn2`, and the function call to `fn1` is replaced with the inlined code. This can improve performance by avoiding the overhead of a function call.\n\nIn terms of the specific optimization, we can see that the loop in `fn1` is eliminated, and the `p.k` expression is moved inside the loop in `fn2`. This allows us to avoid the overhead of repeatedly computing `p.k` in `fn1`.\n\nOverall, this optimization can help improve the performance of the program by reducing the number of function calls and eliminating unnecessary computations.",

The function call `fn1(p)` has been replaced with the body of the function, which is the while loop that accesses the `k` field of the `p` parameter. This allows the compiler to eliminate the function call overhead and improve the performance of the program.\n\nThe inlining of `fn1` also allows the compiler to inline the function `fn2` into `main`, which eliminates the need for the function call and allows the compiler to further optimize the program.\n\nThis is an example of function inlining, which is a widely used optimization technique in compilers to improve the performance of programs.",
