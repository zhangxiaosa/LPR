Instead, the code for `fn1` has been copied directly into `fn2`. This has allowed the compiler to eliminate the function call and the associated overhead.\n\nAs a result of this optimization, the program has been made faster and more efficient.",

This allows the compiler to replace all calls to `fn1()` with the contents of the function, effectively eliminating the function call overhead.\n\nNote that the `static` keyword is used to indicate that the function is only visible within the translation unit (e.g. the file) in which it is defined. The `inline` keyword is used to indicate that the function should be inlined at the point of call.\n\nAlso, note that the `goto` statement in the optimized `fn1()` function has been removed, as it is not needed to achieve the desired behavior.",

The `goto` statement has been replaced with a `return` statement, and the label `w:` has been removed. This allows the function to return directly to the caller without needing to branch to a different location in the code.\n\nAs a result, the `fn2()` function no longer needs to perform a jump to the `fn1()` function, and can instead call it directly. This allows for more efficient function calls and can help to improve the overall performance of the program.",

This tells the compiler to inline the function call to `fn1` whenever it is called, rather than generating a separate function call. This can result in faster execution time and reduced code size.\n\nAdditionally, I have removed the `goto` statement from `fn1`, as it is not necessary and can make the code harder to read and maintain. Instead, I have replaced it with a `while` loop that will continue to execute the code inside the loop indefinitely.\n\nOverall, the modified program is the same as the original, but with the `fn1` function inlined and the `goto` statement replaced with a `while` loop.",
