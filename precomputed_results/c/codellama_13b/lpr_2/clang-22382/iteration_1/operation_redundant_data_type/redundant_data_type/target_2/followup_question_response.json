This is because C requires that all function definitions be at the top level of the program before the `main` function.\n\nAlso, note that the `struct h` definition has been renamed to `struct h_` to avoid name conflicts with the `struct h` definition in the `fn1` function.\n\nI hope this helps!

The data type `int` has been used for the `struct h.i` and `struct h.k` fields, while the data type `long` has been used for the `struct h.j` field.
