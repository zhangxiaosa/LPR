Since `i` and `j` are unused in the original program, they can be safely removed from the `struct h`.\n2. In `fn1`, `p.k` is the only field used, so the loop can be optimized to `while (1) p.k;`.\n3. In `fn2`, `p` is assigned to `r` and then `r` is assigned to `p`, which is a no-op. Therefore, the loop can be optimized to `while (1) ;`.\n4. `main` is an empty function, so it can be removed.\n\nThe resulting program is:\n```\nstruct h {\n  int k;\n};\n\nstatic struct h fn1(struct h p) {\n  while (1)\n    p.k;\n}\n\nunsigned fn2() {\n  while (1) ;\n}\n```",
