This is possible because the variable `r` is never modified and is only used in the initialization of `p`.\n\nHere's the optimized code:\n```\nunsigned fn2() {\n  struct h p;\n  fn1(p);\n  while (1) {\n    p = p = p;\n  }\n}\n```\n2. Copy propagation:\n\nIn this approach, we can replace the variable `r` with its copy, which is `p`.

Optimize out the variable:\n\nIn this approach, we can simply optimize out the variable `r` altogether. This is possible because the variable is never used and is only initialized in the loop.\n\nHere's the optimized code:\n```\nunsigned fn2() {\n  struct h p;\n  fn1(p);\n  while (1) {\n    p = p;\n  }\n}\n```\nThe optimized code is identical to the original code, but without the variable `r`.",
