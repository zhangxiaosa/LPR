This change allows the compiler to optimize the access to the array, since the `volatile` keyword would have prevented the compiler from making any assumptions about the contents of the array.\n\nIt's worth noting that this change may have an impact on the behavior of the program, since the `volatile` keyword was used to ensure that the contents of the array were always up-to-date and not optimized away by the compiler. By removing the `volatile` keyword, the compiler may be able to make assumptions about the contents of the array, which could potentially change the behavior of the program.\n\nIn general, it's important to carefully consider the impact of optimization on the behavior of a program, and to test the program thoroughly after any changes have been made to ensure that it still behaves as expected.",
