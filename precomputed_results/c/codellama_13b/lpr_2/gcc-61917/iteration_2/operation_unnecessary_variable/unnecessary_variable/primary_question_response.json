Therefore, the variable `k` is unused after the loop.\n* `l`: This variable is used in the for loop as the loop counter, but it is not modified inside the loop. Therefore, it is an intermediate variable that can be removed.\n* `m`: This variable is declared as `volatile`, which means that it is not modified by the program. Therefore, it is an unused variable and can be removed.\n* `o`: This variable is not used in the program at all. Therefore, it is an unused variable and can be removed.\n* `p1`: This variable is a function parameter and is used in the function `fn3`. However, it is not modified inside the function, so it is an intermediate variable that can be removed.\n\nTherefore, the list of intermediate or unused variables is:\n\n* `k`\n* `l`\n* `m`\n* `o`\n* `p1`",
