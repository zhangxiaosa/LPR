This loop is unrolled by a factor of 2, which means that the code inside the loop is executed twice for each iteration of the loop. This can be done by introducing a new variable `k` and using it to store the value of `j` after the first iteration of the loop. Then, the loop is modified to execute the code inside the loop twice for each iteration, using the value of `k` instead of `j`.

Here is the optimized program with loop unrolling:
