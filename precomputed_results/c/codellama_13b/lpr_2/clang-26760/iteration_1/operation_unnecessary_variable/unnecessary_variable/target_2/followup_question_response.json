Constant propagation: \n`j` is initialized to `0x24F96B7BL`, which is a constant. Therefore, the value of `j` can be propagated throughout the program.\n2. Copy propagation:\n`m` is assigned the value of `j` which is a constant. Therefore, the value of `m` can be propagated throughout the program.\n3. Dead code elimination:\nThe `f` variable is never used in the program, therefore the loop `for (int f = 0; f;)` is dead code and can be eliminated.\n4. Unreachable code elimination:\nThe `q:` label is never used in the program, therefore the code after the label is unreachable and can be eliminated.\n\nTherefore, the optimized program is:\n```\nint fn1() {\n  unsigned j = 0x24F96B7BL;\n  int m = j;\n  j = j >> 1L;\n  j = j << m;\n}\nint main() {}\n```",
