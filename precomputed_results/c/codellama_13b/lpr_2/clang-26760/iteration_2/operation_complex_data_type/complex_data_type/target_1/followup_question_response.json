The function contains a for loop with a variable `f` and a conditional statement with a label `q`. The loop iterates from `f` to `0` and the conditional statement jumps to the label `q` if the condition is false.\n\nTo optimize the function, we can replace the complex data type `int` with a simple data type `char`.
