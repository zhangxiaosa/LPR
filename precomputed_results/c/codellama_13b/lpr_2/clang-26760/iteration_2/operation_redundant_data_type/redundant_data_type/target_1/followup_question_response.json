The `for` loop was redundant and could be simplified to a `while` loop. Additionally, we have removed the redundant `j = 1` statement and combined it with the `j = j >> 1` statement. This reduces the number of statements in the loop and makes the code more concise.\n\nNote that the `goto` statement was also removed, as it is not necessary for the functionality of the loop.",

This allows the loop to iterate over the range of values from 0 to j-1.\n\nThe while loop has also been eliminated, as it is not necessary to perform the same operation multiple times. Instead, the operation is performed once, and the result is stored in the variable j.\n\nFinally, the program has been wrapped in a pair of ``` to indicate that it is a complete program.",
