This is because the `g` variable is only used to store the value of the `r` array element at a specific index, which is of type `unsigned`. By eliminating the `g` variable, we can reduce the number of data types in the program and make it more efficient.\n\nIt's worth noting that this optimization is only possible because the `g` variable is not used outside of the loop, so it's not necessary to preserve its value between iterations. If the `g` variable were used outside of the loop, we would need to find a different way to optimize the program.",
