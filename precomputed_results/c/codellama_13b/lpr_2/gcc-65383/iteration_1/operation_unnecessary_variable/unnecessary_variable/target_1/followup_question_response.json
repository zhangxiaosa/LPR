Therefore, the program can be simplified to:\n```\nint g;\nunsigned h2 = 0x92A1D2CDL;\nint main() {\n  g = r[0x06D7L][0x06D7L][0x06D7L];\n  return g;\n}\n```\n\nAfter copy propagation, the value of `g` is known to be `r[0x06D7L][0x06D7L][0x06D7L]`, so the return statement can be simplified to `return r[0x06D7L][0x06D7L][0x06D7L];`. Therefore, the program can be simplified to:\n```\nint main() {\n  return r[0x06D7L][0x06D7L][0x06D7L];\n}\n```\n\nSince the variable `h2` is unused, it can be optimized out.

The `g` variable is initialized with the value of `r[0x06D7L][0x06D7L][0x06D7L]`, which is also a constant. Therefore, the program can be further optimized by replacing `g` with this constant value.\n\nHere is the final optimized program:\n```\nint main() {\n  for (;;) {\n    unsigned r[5][9][5];\n    return r[0x06D7L][0x06D7L][0x06D7L];\n  }\n}\n```\nThis program is equivalent to the original program, but with the unused variable `h2` removed and the `if` statement simplified.",
