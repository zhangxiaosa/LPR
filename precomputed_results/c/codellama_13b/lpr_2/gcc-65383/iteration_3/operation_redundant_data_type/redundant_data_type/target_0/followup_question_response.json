The program also uses the `unsigned int` data type for the elements of the array `r`.",

The type of the array `r` is also changed to `unsigned` to match the type of the elements. Finally, the return type of the `main` function is changed to `unsigned` to match the type of the variable `g`.",

This is because the `h2` variable is being used as an index in the `r` array, and the C++ standard requires that the index of an array be of an unsigned integer type. Additionally, I have made the `g` variable an `unsigned int` to match the type of the elements in the `r` array.\n\nI hope this helps!
