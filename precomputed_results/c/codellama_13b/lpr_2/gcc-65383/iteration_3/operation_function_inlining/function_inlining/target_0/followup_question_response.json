The `g` function can be inlined by replacing the `g` variable with its definition in the `main` function.

Additionally, by inlining the function, we have also reduced the number of function calls, which can also improve the performance of the program.",

This eliminates the need for the `g` variable and reduces the number of instructions in the program.\n\nNote that this optimization is only valid if the `g` variable is not modified in any other part of the program.
