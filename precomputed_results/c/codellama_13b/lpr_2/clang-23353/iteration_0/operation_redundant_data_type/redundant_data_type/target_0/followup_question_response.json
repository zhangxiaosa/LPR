The `a` data type is also replaced with `b` in the struct `g` and the variable `i`. The `c` data type is left unchanged.\n\nThe reason for this optimization is to avoid unnecessary casts and to simplify the code. The `a` data type is not used in any other part of the program, so it is unnecessary to keep it. By replacing it with `b`, we can simplify the code and make it easier to read and understand.",
