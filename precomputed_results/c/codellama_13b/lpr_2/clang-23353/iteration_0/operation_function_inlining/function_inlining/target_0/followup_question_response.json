This means that the function call to `fn1` has been replaced with the body of the function. This can help to improve performance, since it eliminates the overhead of function calls.\n\nThe inlining of the function `fn1` was done by the compiler, and it was done based on the analysis of the function `fn2` and the optimization flags that were passed to the compiler. The compiler analyzed the code and determined that inlining the function `fn1` would not have any negative impact on the performance of the program.\n\nIt is important to note that the inlining of a function can also have other benefits, such as:\n\n* Improved readability: Inlining the function can make the code more readable, since it eliminates the need to call the function.\n* Improved performance: Inlining the function can improve performance by eliminating the overhead of function calls.\n* Improved memory usage: Inlining the function can also improve memory usage, since it eliminates the need to store the function in memory.\n\nIn general, inlining a function can have a positive impact on performance, but it should be done carefully and with caution. It is important to ensure that the inlining does not have any negative impact on the readability or maintainability of the code.",
