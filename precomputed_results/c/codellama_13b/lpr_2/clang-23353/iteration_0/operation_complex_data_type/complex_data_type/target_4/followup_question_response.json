The target to be optimized is `p1`, which has type `unsigned int`.\n\nTo optimize `p1`, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Split the `for` loop in `fn2` into two loops: one loop for the case where `p1` is odd, and another loop for the case where `p1` is even.\n2. In the odd loop, use the formula `p1 * (p1 - 1) / 2` to replace the expression `fn1(p3, i) && 1L`.\n3. In the even loop, use the formula `p1 / 2` to replace the expression `fn1(p3, i) && 1L`.\n4. Use the formula `p1 * (p1 + 1) / 2` to replace the expression `fn1(p3, i) && 1L` in the odd loop.\n\nHere is the optimized program:\n```\nchar fn1(char p1, char p2) {\n  return p1 * p2;\n}\n\nint i;\nint j;\nint *fn2(unsigned p1, int *p2, char p3) {\n  if (p1 % 2 == 0) {\n    for (p3 = 6; p3 != -7; p3--)\n      j ^= p1 / 2 && 1L;\n  } else {\n    for (p3 = 6; p3 != -7; p3--)\n      j ^= p1 * (p1 - 1) / 2 && 1L;\n  }\n  return p2;\n}\n\nint main() {\n  return 0;\n}\n```\nIn this optimized program, we have replaced the expression `fn1(p3, i) && 1L` with the appropriate formula based on the value of `p1`. This should improve the performance of the program by reducing the number of function calls.",
