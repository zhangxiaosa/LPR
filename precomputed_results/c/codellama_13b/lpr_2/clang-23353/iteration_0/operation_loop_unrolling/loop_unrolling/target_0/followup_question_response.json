This is because the loop is only executed 7 times, so it is not necessary to check the loop condition each time.\n\nIt is worth noting that this optimization is only valid for this specific case, and may not be applicable in all cases. The loop unrolling optimization is only useful when the loop is executed a fixed number of times, and the loop body is small enough to be repeated multiple times without causing performance issues.",

If either of these conditions is not met, the optimization may not be valid.",

The loop body remains the same.\n\nNote that this optimization is only valid for the specific case where the loop counter `p3` is decremented by one each iteration, and the loop iterates until the counter reaches a specific value.
