The return value of the function is the passed-in pointer p2.\n\nThere are no intermediate or unused variables in this program. The program uses the following variables:\n\n* p1: the first parameter of the function, which is an unsigned integer.\n* p2: the second parameter of the function, which is a pointer to an integer.\n* p3_high: the third parameter of the function, which is a char.\n* i: a local variable that is not initialized or used in the program.\n* j: a local variable that is not initialized or used in the program.\n\nTherefore, the list of variables in the program is [] (empty).",
