This is done to make the code more concise and easier to read by allowing the use of the shorter alias in place of the full data type name.\n\nHowever, in the context of optimization, it is not necessary to use the `typedef` statement to optimize the program. Instead, the original data type can be used directly in the code, which will make the program more readable and easier to maintain.\n\nHere's the optimized version of the program:\n```\nint a;\nchar b;\nstruct c {\n  int d;\n  int e;\n};\nstruct c f;\nchar fn1() {\n  int h = 6L;\n  if (f.e)\n    goto i;\n  fn1();\n  char j;\n  return j;\ni:\n  f.d = h;\n  fn1();\n  j = 0xEEACFBBFL;\n  return j;\n}\nint main() {}\n```\nIn this version of the program, every instance of the `b` data type has been replaced with the `char` data type, which is the original data type. This will make the program more readable and easier to maintain, and it will also allow the optimizer to work more effectively.",
