The expression `t % (5 / ae)` is simplified to `t % 5`, since `ae` is a constant value of `5`.\n\nThe copy propagation optimization has been applied to the program to eliminate the redundant assignments of `ad.o` to `u`. The variable `ad.o` is assigned to `u` twice, but the value of `u` is not changed between these assignments, so the second assignment can be eliminated.\n\nOverall, the optimized program is more efficient and easier to understand than the original program, since it eliminates unnecessary variables and simplifies the calculations.",
