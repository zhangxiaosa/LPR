To optimize the program, we need to decompose the variable `ad` into simpler variables with primary data types.\n\nFirst, we need to create a new variable `ad_n` of type `int` to hold the value of `ad.n`. We can do this by using the following code:\n```\nint ad_n = ad.n;\n```\nNext, we need to create a new variable `ad_o` of type `int` to hold the value of `ad.o`. We can do this by using the following code:\n```\nint ad_o = ad.o;\n```\nNow, we have two variables `ad_n` and `ad_o` that hold the values of the complex data type `ad`. We can use these variables in the rest of the program instead of using the complex data type `ad`.\n\nThe optimized program will look like this:\n```\nint fn1(unsigned p1, int p2) {\n  return p2;\n}\n\nstruct m {\n  int n : 18;\n  int o : 1;\n};\n\nint r;\nstatic int s = -5;\nunsigned t;\nint u;\nunsigned v;\n\nint main() {\n  struct m ad = {1957};\n  int ad_n = ad.n;\n  int ad_o = ad.o;\n  ad_o = fn1(v, 5);\n  int ae;\n  int af = t;\n  ae = ad_o;\n  ad_o = u;\n  r = af % (~s / ae);\n  ad_o = r;\n}\n```\nIn this optimized program, we have replaced the complex data type `ad` with two variables `ad_n` and `ad_o` of type `int`, which can be used in the rest of the program.
