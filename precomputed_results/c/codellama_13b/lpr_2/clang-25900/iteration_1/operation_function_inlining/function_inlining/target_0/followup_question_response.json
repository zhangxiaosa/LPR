The variable `ae` is then used in the expression `u % (5 / ae)` to calculate the remainder of `u` divided by `ae`.\n\nSince the function `fn1` is a simple function that returns its second parameter, we can optimize it out by inlining the function call. This means that the function call is replaced by the body of the function, which in this case is `return p2`.\n\nHere is the optimized program with the function `fn1` inlined:\n```\nstruct m {\n  int n : 18;\n  int o : 1;\n};\nint r;\nint u;\nint main() {\n  struct m ad = {1957};\n  ad.o = 5;\n  int ae = ad.o;\n  ad.o = u;\n  r = u % (5 / ae);\n  ad.o;\n}\n```\nIn this optimized program, the function call to `fn1` is replaced by the body of the function, which is `return p2`.
