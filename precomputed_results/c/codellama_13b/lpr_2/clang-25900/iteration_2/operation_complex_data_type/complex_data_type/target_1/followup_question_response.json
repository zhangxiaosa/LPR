The `n` member is an `int` with a width of 18 bits, while the `o` member is an `int` with a width of 1 bit.\n\nTo decompose the `struct m` into variables with primary data types, we can do the following:\n\n1. Declare a variable `n` of type `int` with a width of 18 bits, and initialize it with the value `1957`.\n2. Declare a variable `o` of type `int` with a width of 1 bit, and initialize it with the value `ad.o` from the `ad` structure.\n3. Declare a variable `ae` of type `int` with a width of 1 bit, and initialize it with the value `ad.o` from the `ad` structure.\n4. Declare a variable `r` of type `int` with a width of 1 bit, and initialize it with the value `5 % (5 / ae)`.\n5. Declare a variable `ad` of type `struct m`, and initialize it with the value `{1957}`.\n\nThe optimized program with primary data types would look like this:\n```\nint n = 1957;\nint o = ad.o;\nint ae = ad.o;\nint r = 5 % (5 / ae);\nstruct m ad = {1957};\n```",
