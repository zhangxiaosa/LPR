Since `d` is a vector of `long`s, we can decompose it into an array of `long`s.\n\nHere's the modified program:\n```\n#include <stdio.h>\n\ntypedef long d[1];\n\nlong fn1() {\n  long c = 0;\n  return c;\n}\n\nd fn2() {\n  long c = fn1;\n  d f = {c};\n  return f;\n}\n\nint main() {\n  long c = fn1;\n  d f = {c};\n  printf(\"f[0] = %ld\\n\", f[0]);\n  return 0;\n}\n```\nIn this modified program, the `d` data type is replaced with an array of `long`s. The `fn2` function now returns an array of `long`s instead of a vector of `long`s. The `main` function also accesses the first element of the array using the `[]` operator.\n\nThis modification should make it easier to optimize the program, as we can now work with individual `long` variables instead of a complex data type.",

The `d` variable is initialized with the `fn2()` function, which returns a `d` type vector with the length of `d_length` and the data stored in the `d_data` array.\n\nThe `printf()` function is used to print the value of the first element in the `d` type vector, which is stored in the `f[0]` element.\n\nThe optimized program with primary data types is:\n```\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint d_length = sizeof(long);\nlong d_data[d_length];\n\nlong fn1() {\n  long c = 0;\n  return c;\n}\n\nlong fn2() {\n  long c = fn1;\n  for (int i = 0; i < d_length; i++) {\n    d_data[i] = c;\n  }\n  return d_data;\n}\n\nint main() {\n  long c = fn1;\n  long d = fn2();\n  printf(\"f[0] = %ld\\n\", d[0]);\n  return 0;\n}\n```\nIn this program, the `d_length` variable is an integer variable that represents the length of the `d` type vector.
