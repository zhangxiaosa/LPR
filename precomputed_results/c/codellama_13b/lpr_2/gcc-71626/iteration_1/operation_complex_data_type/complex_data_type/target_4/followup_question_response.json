The `fn1` function is also a complex data type, but it has no fields.\n\nTo decompose the `f` variable into primary data types, we can simply remove the field `fn1` from the `d` type and replace it with a variable of type `long`.

In this case, the variable `f` is of type `d` which is a complex data type. To optimize it, we can decompose it into variables with primary data types.\n\nLet's analyze the program and identify the variables that can be decomposed into primary data types.\n\n1. `fn1`: This is a function that returns a value of type `d`. We can't optimize this function because it doesn't have any expensive computations.\n2. `fn2`: This is a function that returns a value of type `d`. We can optimize this function by decomposing the `d` type into its primary data types.\n3. `main`: This is the main function that calls `fn2` and returns the result. We can't optimize this function because it doesn't have any expensive computations.\n\nTo decompose the `d` type into primary data types, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the members of the `d` type. In this case, the members are `fn1`.\n2. Identify the data types of the members. In this case, the data types are `long`.\n3. Decompose the `d` type into individual variables of type `long`.\n\nHere's the optimized program:\n```\ntypedef long d __attribute__((__vector_size__(sizeof(long))));\nd fn1() {}\nd fn2() {\n  long fn1_result = fn1();\n  return fn1_result;\n}\nd main() {}\n```\nIn this optimized program, we have decomposed the `d` type into individual variables of type `long`. This will reduce the complexity of the program and make it easier to optimize.",
