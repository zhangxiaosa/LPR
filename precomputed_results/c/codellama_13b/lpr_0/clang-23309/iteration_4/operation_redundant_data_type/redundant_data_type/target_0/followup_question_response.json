The data type `short` is not used in the program, and its elimination does not affect the program's functionality.\n2. The data type `short` is not needed in the program because the function `fn2` takes two `unsigned` arguments, and the function `fn6` takes two `unsigned` arguments and returns a `short` value. Therefore, the data type `short` is not needed in the program.\n3. The data type `short` is not needed in the program because the function `fn10` takes a single `unsigned` argument and returns an `unsigned` value. Therefore, the data type `short` is not needed in the program.\n\nOverall, the elimination of the data type `short` in this program does not affect its functionality and improves its readability by reducing the number of data types used in the program.",
