To decompose it into its primary data types, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Start with the `g` type definition: `typedef unsigned g;`.\n2. Substitute the `g` type for its definition in the `fn9` function signature: `fn9(unsigned long p1, char *p2, int p3) { p = p1; }`\n3. The `p1` variable is now a `unsigned long` type: `unsigned long p1`.\n4. The `unsigned long` type is a primary data type, so we can stop here.\n\nTherefore, the `p1` variable in function `fn9` is decomposed into its primary data types as follows: `unsigned long p1`.",
