The loop condition `w = 3` is optimized to `w = 3L`, and the loop body is optimized by removing the `al = 3L` statement.\n4. The variable `al` is then removed from the code and its value is replaced with the constant `3L` in the function `fn12`.\n5. The function `fn12` is then optimized by removing the local variable `al` and its assignment.\n6. The function `fn13` is optimized by removing the local variable `al` and its assignment.\n7. The function `main` is optimized by removing the local variable `al` and its assignment.\n\nThe resulting optimized code is shorter and more efficient than the original code, and it produces the same output.",
