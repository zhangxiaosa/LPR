This is because the `fn5` and `fn6_optimized` functions return `short` values, which are then used in the `fn10` function as the `p2` argument. The `fn10` function then takes the `p2` argument and uses it in a calculation, which requires an `unsigned` value.

Use bitwise operators to perform operations on individual bits of the `p2` variable. This can help reduce the number of instructions required to perform the operation and improve performance.\n2. Use of constant values to simplify the operation. For example, in the line `p2 = fn5(ab, ac) || (an = w) == 0x294A85636008822D;`, the constant value `0x294A85636008822D` can be replaced with a variable or a macro to simplify the operation.\n3. Use of inline functions to reduce the number of function calls. For example, the function `fn10` can be inlined to reduce the number of function calls.\n4. Use of loop unrolling to reduce the number of iterations. For example, the loop in the function `fn13` can be unrolled to reduce the number of iterations.\n5. Use of array operations to perform operations on multiple elements of an array in parallel. For example, the function `fn9` can be optimized to use array operations to perform operations on multiple elements of the `p` array in parallel.\n6. Use of data parallelism to perform operations on multiple elements of an array in parallel. For example, the function `fn10` can be optimized to use data parallelism to perform operations on multiple elements of the `p2` array in parallel.\n7. Use of cache optimization to improve performance. For example, the function `fn10` can be optimized to use cache optimization to improve performance.\n8. Use of branch prediction to reduce the number of branch mispredictions. For example, the function `fn10` can be optimized to use branch prediction to reduce the number of branch mispredictions.\n\nBy applying these techniques, the program can be optimized to improve performance and reduce the number of instructions required to perform the operation.",
