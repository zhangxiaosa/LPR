We have also eliminated the temporary variable `ao` and replaced it with a constant value `0xBCD1L`. Finally, we have eliminated the redundant `fn13` function and replaced it with an inline call to `fn10`.\n\nThe resulting program is smaller, faster, and more efficient. It should produce the same output as the original program, but with improved performance.",
