I have also eliminated the data type \"short\" and substituted every instance of it with its associated original data type, which is \"int\". The reason for doing this is to make the program more concise and easier to read.\n\nNote that in the optimized program, the data types of the variables that are passed as arguments to the function fn10() are changed from \"unsigned\" to \"int\". This is because the function fn10() has been modified to use \"int\" as the data type for its arguments, and it is not necessary to use \"unsigned\" for these arguments.\n\nAlso note that in the optimized program, the data type of the variable \"ap\" is changed from \"unsigned\" to \"int\". This is because the variable \"ap\" is used as an argument to the function fn9(), which takes an \"int\" as its third argument. Therefore, it is more appropriate to use \"int\" as the data type for \"ap\" in this context.",
