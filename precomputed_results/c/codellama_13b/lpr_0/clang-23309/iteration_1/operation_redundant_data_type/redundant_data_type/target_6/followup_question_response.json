The `short` data type was removed from the program and replaced with `unsigned` in the `fn5` and `fn6` functions, as well as in the `fn10` function.\n3. The `unsigned` data type was added to the `fn13` function.\n4. The `int` data type was removed from the `an` variable in the `fn10` function and replaced with `long`.\n5. The `short` data type was removed from the `p2` parameter in the `fn10` function and replaced with `unsigned`.\n6. The `long` data type was removed from the `am` and `an` variables in the `fn10` function and replaced with `unsigned`.\n7.
