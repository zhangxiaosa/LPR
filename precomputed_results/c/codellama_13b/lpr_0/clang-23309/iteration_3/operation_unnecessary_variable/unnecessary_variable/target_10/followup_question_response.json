Here's how:\n\n1. In `fn10`, the `w` variable is only used in the calculation of `an`. Since `an` is a local variable and is not used outside of `fn10`, we can safely remove the reference to `w` and replace it with its value.\n2. In `fn2`, the `p2` parameter is only used in the calculation of the return value. Since `p2` is a local variable and is not used outside of `fn2`, we can safely remove the reference to `p2` and replace it with its value.\n3. In `fn6`, the `p2` parameter is only used in the calculation of the return value. Since `p2` is a local variable and is not used outside of `fn6`, we can safely remove the reference to `p2` and replace it with its value.\n4. In `fn10`, the `fn2` function is only used in the calculation of the return value. Since `fn2` is a local function and is not used outside of `fn10`, we can safely remove the reference to `fn2` and replace it with its value.\n5. In `fn10`, the `fn6` function is only used in the calculation of the return value. Since `fn6` is a local function and is not used outside of `fn10`, we can safely remove the reference to `fn6` and replace it with its value.\n\nAfter applying these optimizations, the `w` variable is no longer used in the program, and can be removed.
