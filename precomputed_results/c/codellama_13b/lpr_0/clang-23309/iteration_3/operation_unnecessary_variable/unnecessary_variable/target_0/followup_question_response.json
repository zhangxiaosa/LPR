Therefore, the value of `an` can be propagated to the callers of `fn10` and the variable can be eliminated.\n* The variable `v` is also used only in the `fn13` function, but it is assigned a value in the `fn10` function. Since the value of `v` is not used outside of `fn10`, it can be eliminated and replaced with a local variable in `fn13`.\n* The variable `w` is not used in the program, so it can be eliminated.\n* The variable `ac` is used only in the `fn10` function, but it is assigned a value of `1` that is never changed. Therefore, the value of `ac` can be propagated to the callers of `fn10` and the variable can be eliminated.\n\nThe resulting program is:\n```\nunsigned fn2(unsigned p1, short p2) { return p1 - p2; }\nunsigned fn6(unsigned p1, short p2) { return p2; }\nunsigned fn10(unsigned p1, short p2) {\n  unsigned an = 250;\n  p2 = ac || (an = w) == 0x294A85636008822D;\n  unsigned v = fn2((short)0xBCD1 - (fn6(1, an) & 1) << 8, p2) & 1;\n  return v;\n}\nunsigned fn13() {\n  unsigned v = fn10(v, 0);\n  return 1;\n}\nint main() {\n  fn13();\n  printf(\"checksum = %X\\n\", v);\n  return 0;\n}\n```",
