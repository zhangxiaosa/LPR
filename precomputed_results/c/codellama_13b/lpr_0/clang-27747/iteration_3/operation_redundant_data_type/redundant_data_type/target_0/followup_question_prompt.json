The program is struct c {\n  int d : 18;\n  int e;\n};\nstruct c i, j;\nint main() {\n  struct c l;\n  l.d = j.e;\n  int n = j.d && l.d;\n  i.d = l.d | -(l.d && l.d) - n;\n}\n.                 The target to be optimized is `int`\n\nThe program defines a structure `struct c` with two members `d` and `e`, both of type `int`. The variable `i` and `j` are both declared as instances of `struct c`. The variable `l` is declared as a local variable of type `struct c` in the `main()` function.\n\nTherefore, the identified data types are:\n."}]
