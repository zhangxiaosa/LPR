The result is a smaller and more efficient program, with no function call overhead.\n\nNote that the optimization is only possible because the function `d()` is a simple function that only performs a bitwise operation on its input. If the function `d()` had more complex logic, it would not be possible to inline it and the original code would remain.",

The function `d()` is no longer called, and its contents have been directly accessed and operated on as required in the `main()` function. This optimization has improved the performance of the program by reducing the number of function calls and improving the program's overall efficiency.",

However, based on the code snippet provided, it appears to be a local variable defined within the `main()` function.\n\nTo optimize this program, we can use function inlining to eliminate the function call and replace it with the function body.\n\nHere is the optimized program with function inlining:\n```\nstruct c {\n  int d : 18;\n  int e;\n};\nstruct c i, j;\nint main() {\n  struct c l;\n  l.d = j.e;\n  int n = j.d && l.d;\n  i.d = l.d | -(l.d && l.d) - n;\n}\n```\nIn this version of the program, the function `d()` has been inlined, and the function call has been replaced with the function body. This eliminates the overhead of the function call and improves performance.\n\nIt is important to note that function inlining can only be performed if the function is small and has a limited number of input and output parameters. If the function is too large or has too many input and output parameters, inlining may not be beneficial. Additionally, inlining can increase code size and make the program less maintainable, so it should be used judiciously.",
