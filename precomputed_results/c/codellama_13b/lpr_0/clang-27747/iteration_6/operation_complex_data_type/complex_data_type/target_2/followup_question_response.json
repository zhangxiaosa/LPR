        "content": "  Here is the decompiled program with primary data types:\n```\nstruct c {\n  int d;\n};\n\nint main() {\n  struct c l;\n  l.d = i_d;\n  int n = i_d && l.d;\n  i_d = l.d | -(l.d && l.d) - n;\n}\n```\nThe program contains a structure variable `c` with a member variable `d` of type `int`. The `main` function declares a variable `l` of type `struct c` and initializes it with the value of `i_d`. The program then performs some operations on `i_d` and `l.d` to compute a new value for `i_d`.\n\nTo optimize the program, you can try the following steps:\n\n1. Eliminate unnecessary variables: In this program, the variable `n` is not used after it is declared. You can eliminate it and its declaration to simplify the code.\n2. Combine operations: The program performs the operation `i_d = l.d | -(l.d && l.d) - n` in the last line. This operation can be simplified to `i_d = l.d | -l.d`. This is because `l.d && l.d` is always true, so the negative of it is always `-1`, and the `-1` cancels out the `-n`.\n3. Simplify the expression: The program has the expression `i_d && l.d`. This expression is always true if `i_d` is non-zero, so you can simplify it to `i_d != 0 && l.d`.\n4. Use bitwise operations: The program uses bitwise operations to compute the new value of `i_d`. You can simplify the operations by using bitwise operations instead of logical operators. For example, you can replace the expression `l.d | -l.d` with `l.d & ~l.d`.\n\nHere is the optimized program:\n```\nstruct c {\n  int d;\n};\n\nint main() {\n  struct c l;\n  l.d = i_d;\n  i_d = l.d & ~l.d;\n}\n```",
