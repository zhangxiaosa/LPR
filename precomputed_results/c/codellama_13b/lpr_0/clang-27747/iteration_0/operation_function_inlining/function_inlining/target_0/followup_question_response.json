This is done by removing the function definition and replacing the function call with the function body.\n\nThe optimization is done by inlining the function because it is a small function that does not consume a lot of time or memory. Inlining the function allows the compiler to generate more efficient code, as the function body is inlined directly into the calling code, which reduces the overhead of function calls.\n\nNote that this optimization is only possible if the function is small enough and does not have any side effects. Inlining large functions or functions with side effects can have unintended consequences, so the compiler must be careful when inlining these functions.",
