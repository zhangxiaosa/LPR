Based on the code, we can see that the variables `h` and `e` are never used in the program.

In this case, we only have the variable `d` which is used in the struct `c` and the function `fn1()`. Therefore, we can remove all the other variables from the program and only keep the variable `d`.\n```\nstruct c {\n  int d : 18;\n};\n\nstruct c i;\nstruct c j;\n\nint fn1() {\n  struct c l = {24, 6738, 165};\n  int m = j.d;\n  l.d = m;\n  int n = j.d && l.d;\n  int o = l.d;\n  int k = l.d;\n  i.d = o | -(k && l.d) - n;\n}\n\nint main() {}\n```\nAfter removing the unused variables, we can optimize the program by combining the variables `m`, `n`, `o`, and `k` into a single variable `p`. This will reduce the number of variables in the program and make it easier to understand.\n```\nstruct c {\n  int d : 18;\n};\n\nstruct c i;\nstruct c j;\n\nint fn1() {\n  struct c l = {24, 6738, 165};\n  int p = j.d;\n  l.d = p;\n  int q = p && l.d;\n  int r = l.d;\n  i.d = r | -(r && l.d) - q;\n}\n\nint main() {}\n```\nFinally, we can optimize the code by removing unnecessary expressions and variables. For example, the expression `l.d = p` is not necessary as `l.d` is already equal to `p`. Therefore, we can remove this expression and simplify the code as follows:\n```\nstruct c {\n  int d : 18;\n};\n\nstruct c i;\nstruct c j;\n\nint fn1() {\n  struct c l = {24, 6738, 165};\n  int p = j.d;\n  int q = p && l.d;\n  int r = l.d;\n  i.d = r | -(r && l.d) - q;\n}\n\nint main() {}\n```\nThis is the optimized version of the program.",
