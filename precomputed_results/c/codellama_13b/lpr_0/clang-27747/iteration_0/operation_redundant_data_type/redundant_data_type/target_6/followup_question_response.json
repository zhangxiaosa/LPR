The `fn1` function is also defined, which takes no arguments and returns `int`. Inside this function, a variable named `l` is declared as a struct `c` with members `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, and `h`, and is initialized with values. The value of `j.e` is assigned to `m`, and then `l.d` is assigned the value of `m`. A variable named `n` is created and is assigned the value of `j.h` AND `l.d`. The value of `l.d` is assigned to `o`, and then `g` is assigned the value of `o` OR the negation of the result of `(l.f && l.d)` minus `n`. Finally, `i.g` is assigned the value of `g`.\n\nThe target of optimization is `g` which is declared as `signed g;`. This data type is not needed in this program, so it can be eliminated. The program can be optimized by changing the data type of `g` to `int`.\n```\nstruct c {\n  int d : 18;\n  int e;\n  int f;\n  int g;\n  int h;\n};\n\nstruct c i;\nstruct c j;\n\nint fn1() {\n  struct c l = {24, 6738, 165};\n  int m = j.e;\n  l.d = m;\n  int n = j.h && l.d;\n  int o = l.d;\n  int g = o | -(l.f && l.d) - n;\n  i.g = g;\n}\n\nint main() {}\n```\nThis optimized program has the same functionality as the original program, but with the data type of `g` changed from `signed g;` to `int`.",
