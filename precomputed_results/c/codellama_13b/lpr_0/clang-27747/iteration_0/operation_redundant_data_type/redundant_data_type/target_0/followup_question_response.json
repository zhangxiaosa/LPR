The member `d` is a bit field with a width of 18 bits, while the other three members are of type `unsigned int`.\n\nThe function `fn1` is defined as returning a value of type `b` (which is an alias for `int`) and taking no arguments. It declares a local variable `l` of type `struct c` and initializes it with the values `24`, `6738`, and `165`. It then assigns `j.e` to `l.d`, calculates `l.d` and `j.h && l.d` using the bitwise AND operator, and assigns the result to `n`.\n\nThe function then calculates `p` using the bitwise OR operator and the unary minus operator, and assigns `p` to `i.g`.\n\nThe `main` function is defined as returning an `int` and taking no arguments.\n\nIn this program, the `typedef` statement is used to define a new name for the type `signed int`, which is named `a`. This allows the program to use `a` instead of `signed int` throughout the program.\n\nThe `struct` definition `struct c` is used to define a new data type that contains four members: `d`, `e`, `f`, and `g`. The member `d` is a bit field with a width of 18 bits, while the other three members are of type `unsigned int`.\n\nThe function `fn1` is defined as returning a value of type `b` (which is an alias for `int`) and taking no arguments.
