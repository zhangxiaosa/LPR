The program then creates a variable `l` of type `struct c` and assigns the value of `i_d` to `l.d`. The program then performs a bitwise AND operation on `i_d` and `l.d` and stores the result in a variable `n`. Finally, the program assigns the value of `l.d` to `i_d` with a bitwise OR operation.\n\nTo optimize the program, we can first decompose the `struct c` type into primitive variables. The `struct c` type can be decomposed into two primitive variables `d` and `n`, where `d` is of type `int` with a bit width of 18 and `n` is of type `int` with a bit width of 1.\n\nHere is the optimized program:\n```\nint d;\nint n;\n\nint main() {\n  d = i_d;\n  n = i_d && d;\n  i_d = d | -(d && d) - n;\n}\n```\nIn this optimized program, we have replaced the `struct c` type with two primitive variables `d` and `n`, which can be easily optimized by the compiler.
