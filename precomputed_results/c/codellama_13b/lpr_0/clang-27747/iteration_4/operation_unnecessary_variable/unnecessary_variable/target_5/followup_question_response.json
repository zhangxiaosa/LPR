This is done by replacing the `struct c i, j;` declaration with `struct c i;`, and then replacing all occurrences of `j` in the `main` function with `i`.\n\nNote that constant propagation and copy propagation are both compiler optimizations that can be applied to the code to further improve its performance.

The variable `l` is also removed as it is not used in the `main` function. The constant `0` is assigned to `l.d` as the initialization value. The rest of the code remains the same.\n\nBy constant propagation, the expression `j.d && l.d` is evaluated to `0` as `j.d` is not used and `l.d` is initialized to `0`. Therefore, the expression `l.d | -(l.d && l.d) - n` is evaluated to `-n`. The final optimized program is:\n```\nstruct c {\n  int d : 18;\n};\n\nstruct c i;\n\nint main() {\n  struct c l;\n  l.d = 0; // assuming j.d is not used\n  int n = 0;\n  i.d = -(0 && 0) - n;\n}\n```\nBy copy propagation, the expression `l.d | -(l.d && l.d) - n` can be simplified to `l.d | -n`. The final optimized program is:\n```\nstruct c {\n  int d : 18;\n};\n\nstruct c i;\n\nint main() {\n  struct c l;\n  l.d = 0; // assuming j.d is not used\n  int n = 0;\n  i.d = l.d | -n;\n}\n```",

The `j` variable is not used in the `main` function, so it can be safely removed.\n\nAs for the other variables, we have used constant propagation and copy propagation to optimize the program. For example, the `l.d` variable is assigned the value of `j.d` in the first line of the `main` function. This means that we can replace all occurrences of `l.d` with `j.d` in the rest of the program, since they have the same value.\n\nWe have also used constant folding to simplify the expression `j.d && l.d` to `j.d` in the third line of the `main` function. This expression is always equal to `j.d`, since `&&` is a logical operator that only returns `true` when both operands are non-zero.\n\nHere is the optimized program with the constant propagation and copy propagation applied:\n```\nstruct c {\n  int d : 18;\n};\n\nstruct c i;\n\nint main() {\n  struct c l;\n  l.d = j.d;\n  int n = j.d;\n  i.d = l.d | -(j.d && j.d) - n;\n}\n```\nIn this version, we have removed the unused variable `j` and simplified the expressions `j.d && l.d` and `l.d && l.d` to `j.d` and `j.d`, respectively. This has allowed us to remove the `j` variable from the program entirely.",
