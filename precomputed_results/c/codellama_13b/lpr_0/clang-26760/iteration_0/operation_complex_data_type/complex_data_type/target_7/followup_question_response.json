To optimize the program, we need to decompose the complex data type into primary data types.\n\nHere is the decomposition of the variable `l` into primary data types:\n\n1. `l` is of type `unsigned long long int`, which can be decomposed into 2 primary data types:\n* `unsigned long`\n* `int`\n2. `long` is a primary data type in C, which represents a signed integer value that is at least 32 bits wide.\n3. `int` is a primary data type in C, which represents a signed integer value that is at least 16 bits wide.\n\nTherefore, the optimized variable `l` can be represented as a combination of `unsigned long` and `int`:\n```\nunsigned long l_high;\nint l_low;\n```\nThe optimized program can then be written as:\n```\nint g;\nint fn1() {\n  int i;\n  unsigned j_low;\n  unsigned j_high = 0x24F96B7BL;\n  unsigned k;\n  for (g = 0; g;)\n    for (; j_high; --j_high)\n      ;\n  unsigned long l_high = 1L;\n  int l_low = j_high;\n  unsigned n = g;\n  unsigned o = n;\n\nq:;\n  k = k >> l_low;\n  i = o;\n  if (i) {\n    k = k << l_high;\n    goto q;\n  }\n}\n\nint main() {}\n```\nThis optimized program uses the `unsigned long` and `int` data types for the variable `l`, which are primary data types in C.

To optimize the performance of the program, we need to reduce the number of iterations of the for loop by reducing the value of `l` which is a variable of type `unsigned`.\n\nTo achieve this, we can decompose the `l` variable into two variables with primary data type, one of type `unsigned` and another of type `int`. The `unsigned` variable will store the high-order bits of `l` and the `int` variable will store the low-order bits of `l`.\n\nHere is the updated program with the decomposition:\n```\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main()\n{\n    int g;\n    int fn1()\n    {\n        int i;\n        unsigned j_low;\n        unsigned j_high = 0x24F96B7BL;\n        unsigned k;\n        unsigned l_hi = l >> 32;\n        int l_lo = l & 0xFFFFFFFF;\n        for (g = 0; g;)\n        {\n            for (; j_high; --j_high)\n            {\n                k = k >> l_hi;\n                i = o;\n                if (i)\n                {\n                    k = k << m;\n                    goto q;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    int l = 1L;\n    unsigned m = j_high;\n    unsigned n = g;\n    unsigned o = n;\n\nq:;\n    k = k >> l_lo;\n    i = o;\n    if (i)\n    {\n        k = k << m;\n        goto q;\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this updated program, we have added two new variables `l_hi` and `l_lo` to store the high-order and low-order bits of `l` respectively. We have also modified the `for` loop to use these variables instead of `l`.\n\nBy decomposing `l` into two variables, we have reduced the number of iterations of the for loop and have improved the performance of the program.",
