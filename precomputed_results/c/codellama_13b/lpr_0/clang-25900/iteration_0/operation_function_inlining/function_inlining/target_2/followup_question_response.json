This has allowed the compiler to eliminate the function call and reduce the overhead associated with it.\n\nHere is the explanation of how the program has been optimized:\n\n1. The `fn3` function has been inlined into the `fn2` function by replacing the function call `fn3(p5)` with the body of the `fn3` function.\n2. The body of the `fn3` function has been modified to use the local variables `ad`, `ae`, `af`, and `r` instead of the global variables `v`, `u`, and `s`.\n3. The `fn3` function has been removed from the program.\n\nBy inlining the `fn3` function and modifying the code to use local variables instead of global variables, the program has been optimized to reduce the overhead associated with function calls. This has allowed the program to run more efficiently and improve its performance.",

The function `fn3` then returned `ad.o`.\n\nIn the optimized program, the function `fn1` has been inlined directly into the function `fn3`, and the function `fn3` has been modified to return the result of `af % (~s / ae)` instead of `ad.o`. The function `fn3` has also been modified to remove the declaration of the local variable `ae`, since it is no longer needed.\n\nOverall, this optimization has resulted in the removal of a function call and the inlining of a function body, which can improve the performance of the program.",
