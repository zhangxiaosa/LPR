Constant propagation:\n* The variable `s` is assigned the value `-5L`, which is a constant. Therefore, the expression `~s / ae` can be simplified to `5`.\n* The variable `t` is never modified, so its value can be propagated to the function `fn3` and the expression `af % t` can be simplified to `af % 5`.\n2. Copy propagation:\n* The variable `ad` is assigned the value `{1957}`, which is a constant. Therefore, the expression `ad.o = fn1(v, 5)` can be simplified to `ad.o = 5`.\n* The variable `ae` is assigned the value `ad.o`, which is a constant.
