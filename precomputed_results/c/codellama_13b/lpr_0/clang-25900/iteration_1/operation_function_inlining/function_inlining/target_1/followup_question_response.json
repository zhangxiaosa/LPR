This results in a smaller and more efficient program, as the function call overhead is eliminated.

This means that the `fn3` function has been replaced with its body, and the call to `fn3` has been removed. This has resulted in a number of optimizations, including:\n* Removing the overhead of a function call\n* Removing the need to store the return value of `fn3` in a variable\n* Simplifying the expression `af % (~s / ae)` by inlining the call to `fn1`\n\nBy inlining the `fn3` function, the program has been optimized to run more efficiently and to use less memory. The resulting code is more concise and easier to read than the original version.",
