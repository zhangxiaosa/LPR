This allows the compiler to eliminate the function call and the overhead associated with it.\n\nIn particular, the code for `fn1` is inlined into the code for `fn2` at the line `fn1(f, e, e, e);`. This means that the code for `fn1` is directly copied into the code for `fn2`, and the function call is eliminated.\n\nThe resulting code for `fn2` is as follows:\n```\nd fn2() {\n  c q = 0xC3L;\n  b r[5][9][5];\n  if (h[2])\n    return q;\n  g = r[i][i][i];\n  return j;\n}\n```\nThis code is equivalent to the original code for `fn2`, but with the function call to `fn1` eliminated.",

This allows the compiler to eliminate the function call and the associated overhead.\n\nThe `fn1()` function has also been modified to return `g` directly, rather than storing it in a temporary variable and then returning it. This eliminates the need for the additional variable and the overhead of storing and retrieving it.\n\nOverall, this optimized version of the program should run faster and use less memory than the original version, due to the elimination of the function call and the optimization of the `fn1()` function.",
