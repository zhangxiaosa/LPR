The `if` statement in the original `fn1` function has been replaced with a `while` loop, which will continue to loop until `h2` becomes 0. The loop body has been modified to set `g` to the value of `r[0x06D7L][0x06D7L][0x06D7L]` every iteration, regardless of the value of `h2`.\n\nThis optimization is beneficial because it eliminates the need for a function call and a return statement, which can help improve performance.
