This allows the compiler to avoid the overhead of calling a function and instead perform the subtraction directly in the loop.\n\nNote that we have also removed the `volatile` keyword from the declaration of `m` as it is not necessary in this case.

To optimize it out via function inlining, we can replace the function call with the actual function body.\n\nHere is the optimized program:\n```\ntypedef unsigned f;\nf fn2(f p1, f p2) { return p1 - p2; }\nint k;\nf l;\nvolatile f m[5][8];\nf fn3(f p1) {\n  f o;\n  for (;;) {\n    for (; l; l++)\n      for (k = 0; k >= -27; k -= 6)\n        p1 = o - p1;\n    p1 || m[2][5];\n  }\n}\nint main() {}\n```\nIn this optimized program, the function call `fn2(o, p1)` has been replaced with the function body `o - p1`, which is equivalent to the subtraction operation performed by the `fn2` function. This optimization eliminates the function call overhead and improves the performance of the program.",

This optimization reduces the overhead of function calls and improves performance.\n\nNote that this optimization is only applicable if the `fn2` function does not have any side effects, as it is being called with the same arguments multiple times.
