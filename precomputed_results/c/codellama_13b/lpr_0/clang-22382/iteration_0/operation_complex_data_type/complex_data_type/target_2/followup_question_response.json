We can optimize this variable by making it a primitive data type, rather than a struct.\n\nHere is the modified program with `p3` as a primitive data type:\n```\nstruct s {\n  int i;\n  long j;\n  unsigned k;\n};\nunsigned l;\n\nstatic struct s fn1(unsigned p1, signed p2, unsigned p3, unsigned p4, struct s p5) {\n  p5.k;\nw:;\n  goto w;\n}\n\nunsigned fn2(p1) {\n  struct s p;\n  signed q;\n  fn1(q, 0, p1, 3, p);\n  for (;;) {\n    struct s r = p;\n    p = r;\n  }\n}\n\nint main() {}\n```\nIn this modified program, we have replaced the struct `s` with a primitive data type `unsigned` for the variable `p3`.
