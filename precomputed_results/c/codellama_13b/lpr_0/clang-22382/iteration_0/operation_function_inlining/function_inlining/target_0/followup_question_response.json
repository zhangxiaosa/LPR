This means that the code for `fn1` is copied directly into the body of `fn2`, eliminating the need for a function call. This can improve performance by reducing the number of function calls and the overhead associated with function calls.\n\nNote that the `return` statement at the end of `fn1` is not necessary, as the function does not have a return type.

This means that the body of `fn1` has been copied directly into the `fn2` function, and the call to `fn1` has been replaced by the body of the function.

This means that the code for `fn1` is duplicated into the body of `fn2`, and the call to `fn1` is eliminated. This allows the compiler to eliminate the overhead of function calls, and can potentially improve the performance of the program.\n\nNote that this optimization is only performed in certain cases, and the compiler must determine that the function can be inlined in order to perform this optimization. Additionally, the inlining optimization may not always be desirable, as it can increase the size of the program and make it more difficult to maintain and debug.",
