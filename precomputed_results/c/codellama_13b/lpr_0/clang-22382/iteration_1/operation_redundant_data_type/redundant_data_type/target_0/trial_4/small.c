The program has been modified to replace all instances of `unsigned` with `int`. The changes are as follows:

1. The `fn1` function has an additional argument `p3`, which is an `int` instead of an `unsigned`.
2. The `fn2` function has an additional local variable `q`, which is a struct `s` instead of an `unsigned`.
3. The loop in `fn2` has been modified to use the `q` variable instead of an `unsigned`.

The resulting program is as follows:
