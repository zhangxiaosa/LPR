This can be done by replacing the statement `q = r` with a long integer variable, such as `q = r.k`. This will eliminate the need for the complex data type `struct s` and simplify the program.\n\nHere is the optimized program:\n```c\nstruct s {\n  long i;\n  long j;\n  long k;\n};\n\nstatic struct s fn1(struct s p5) {\n  p5.k;\nw:;\n  goto w;\n}\n\nlong fn2() {\n  long q;\n  fn1(q);\n  for (;;) {\n    long r = q;\n    q = r;\n  }\n}\n\nint main() {}\n```",
