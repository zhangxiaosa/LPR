We can break down the complex data type into its individual components:\n\t* `struct s***`: a pointer to a pointer to a pointer to a structure\n\t* `struct s`: a structure with three long integer members\n\t* `long***`: a pointer to a pointer to a long integer\n\t* `long*`: a pointer to a long integer\n\t* `long`: a long integer\n3. We can define the following variables to represent each component:\n\t* `struct s*** p`: a pointer to a pointer to a pointer to a structure\n\t* `struct s s`: a structure with three long integer members\n\t* `long*** q`: a pointer to a pointer to a long integer\n\t* `long* r`: a pointer to a long integer\n\t* `long x`: a long integer\n4. We can then use these variables to access and modify the complex data type:\n```c\nstruct s*** p;\nstruct s s;\nlong*** q;\nlong* r;\nlong x;\n\n// Initialize p, s, q, r, and x\n\n// Access and modify the complex data type using p, s, q, r, and x\np->q->r->x = 10;\n```\nThis program shows how to access and modify the complex data type `struct s***` using the variables `p`, `s`, `q`, `r`, and `x`. The program first initializes the variables and then uses them to access and modify the complex data type.\n\nI hope this helps you understand how to decompose a complex data type into variables with primary data types.
