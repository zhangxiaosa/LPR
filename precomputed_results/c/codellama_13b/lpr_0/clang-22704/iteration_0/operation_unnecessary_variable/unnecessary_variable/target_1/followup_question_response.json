In the if-statement, the condition is just checking if `f_e` is zero or not. Since `f_e` is not used anywhere else in the program, it can be considered a constant and it is not used for anything else. Therefore, we can replace the condition with a constant true value and eliminate the if-statement.\n```\nint f_d;\nint f_e;\nint fn1() {\n  long h = 6;\n  fn1();\n  int j = 0xEEACFBBF;\n  return j;\ni:\n  f_d = h;\n  fn1();\n  return j;\n}\nint main() {}\n```\nThe optimization is done by using copy propagation. In the function `fn1`, variable `h` is assigned with value 6. This value is then used to assign variable `f_d`. Since `f_d` is not used anywhere else in the program, it can be considered a copy of `h` and it is not used for anything else. Therefore, we can replace all the occurrences of `f_d` with `h` and eliminate the variable `f_d`.\n```\nint fn1() {\n  long h = 6;\n  fn1();\n  int j = 0xEEACFBBF;\n  return j;\ni:\n  h = 6;\n  fn1();\n  return j;\n}\nint main() {}\n```\nThe final optimized program is:\n```\nint fn1() {\n  long h = 6;\n  fn1();\n  int j = 0xEEACFBBF;\n  return j;\ni:\n  h = 6;\n  fn1();\n  return j;\n}\nint main() {}\n```",
