The optimized code is as follows:\n```\nstruct c {\n  int d;\n  int e;\n};\n\nstruct c f;\n\nint fn1() {\n  int h = 6L;\n  if (f.e)\n    goto i;\n  int j;\n  return j;\ni:\n  f.d = h;\n  j = 0xEEACFBBFL;\n  return j;\n}\n\nint main() {\n  // call the function\n  fn1();\n  return 0;\n}\n```\nIt is important to note that the optimized code may not be equivalent to the original code in terms of its behavior, as the recursive call to `fn1` may have had some side effects that are not present in the optimized code. Therefore, it is important to thoroughly test the optimized code to ensure that it behaves as intended.",
