Similarly, the data type `b` is defined as an alias for the `char` data type.\n\nTo eliminate the `a` data type and substitute every instance of it with its associated original data type, we can simply replace `a` with `int` throughout the program.

The data type `a` is also used in the `struct c` definition to define the data members `d` and `e`.\n\nTo optimize the program for the target `a`, we need to eliminate the use of the `typedef` keyword and replace every instance of `a` with `int`. This will ensure that the program is optimized for the target `a`.\n\nHere's the optimized program:\n```\nint h = 6L;\nif (f.e)\n  goto i;\nfn1();\nint j;\nreturn j;\ni:\nf.d = h;\nfn1();\nj = 0xEEACFBBFL;\nreturn j;\n```\nNote that the `typedef` keyword has been eliminated and the data type `a` has been replaced with `int` in all instances.",
