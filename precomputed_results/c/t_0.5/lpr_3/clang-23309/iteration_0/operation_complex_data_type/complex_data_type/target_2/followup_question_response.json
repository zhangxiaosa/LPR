Inside the `if` statement, there is a declaration of a local variable `p2` as an unsigned integer.

The function subtracts the second parameter from the first and returns the result.\n\n2. The program defines the following variables:\n   - `p`: an unsigned integer\n   - `v`: a long integer\n   - `w`: a short integer\n   - `ac`: a short integer initialized to 1\n\n3. The `main` function begins by defining the following variables:\n   - `am`: a long integer initialized to 1L\n   - `an`: an integer\n\n4.
