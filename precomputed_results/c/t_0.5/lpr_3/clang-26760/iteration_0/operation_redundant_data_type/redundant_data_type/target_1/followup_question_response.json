The program declares a variable `g` of type `signed int`.\n\n3. The `main()` function begins:\n   - It declares a variable `i` of type `signed int`.\n   - It declares a variable `j` of type `c` (which is equivalent to `int`) and initializes it with the hexadecimal value `0x24F96B7BL`.\n   - It declares a variable `k` of type `e` (which is equivalent to `unsigned`) without initializing it.\n\n4. The program enters an `if` statement with the condition `j`. If `j` is non-zero, it executes the following block:\n   - It decrements the value of `j` by one.\n\n5.
