If the condition is true, jump to label `q`.\n\nTo optimize out the variable `p`, we can replace all occurrences of `p` with the value it holds (`o`).

The value of `n` is determined by the value of `g`, which is not provided in the given code. Therefore, we cannot perform constant propagation for `n` and subsequently for `p`.\n3. The value of `p` is used in the assignment of `i`.\n4. The value of `i` is used in the conditional statement `if (i)`.\n5. If the condition `if (i)` is true, the value of `p` is used to shift the value of `k` left by `j` bits.\n6. After the shift operation, the program jumps to the label `q`.\n7. The value of `k` is right-shifted by 1 bit at the label `q`.\n\nSince the value of `p` is used in the program, we cannot optimize it out completely. However, we can still perform copy propagation to eliminate the intermediate variables `n` and `o`.
