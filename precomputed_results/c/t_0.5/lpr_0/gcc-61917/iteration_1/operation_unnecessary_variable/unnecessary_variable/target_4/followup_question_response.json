The variable `p1` is used as a parameter in the function `fn3(p1)`.\n2. Inside the `fn3` function, `p1` is used in the expression `p1 = o - p1`. This assignment updates the value of `p1`.\n3.

Therefore, we cannot optimize it out using constant propagation.\n\nHowever, we can still optimize the program by removing the unused variable `p1` from the code.
