Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. The program starts with a function declaration: `char fn1(char p1, char p2)`. This function takes two arguments of type `char` and returns a value of type `char`.\n\n2. After the function declaration, there are two variable declarations:\n   - `signed h;`: This declares a variable `h` of type `signed`.\n   - `int i;`: This declares a variable `i` of type `int`.\n\n3. The `main` function is defined next:\n   - `int main() {`: This is the main function of the program.\n   - Inside the `main` function, there is a variable declaration: `char p3;`. This declares a variable `p3` of type `char`.\n   - Next, there is a `for` loop that iterates from `p3 = 6` until `p3 != -7`, with `p3--` as the loop increment.\n   - Inside the loop, there is an expression: `h ^= fn1(p3, i) && 1;`. This expression calls the `fn1` function with arguments `p3` and `i`. The result of the expression is then used in a bitwise XOR operation with `h`.\n\nBased on this analysis, the variables with complex data types in the program are:\n- None\n\nThe identified variables are all of primitive data types.
