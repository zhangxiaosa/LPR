Remove the `if (f)` condition and the corresponding `goto i` statement.\n\n3. Remove the assignment `f = h;` inside the `i` label.\n\n4. Remove the `fn1();` calls since they are not affecting the value of `f`.\n\n5.

In the label `i`, we assign the value of `h` to `f` using the statement `f = h;`. Since `h` is a constant `6L`, we can replace `f` with `6L` in this assignment.

In the original code, `j` is assigned the value `0xEEACFBBFL` inside the `i` label. To ensure `j` is always assigned a value, we can initialize it with `0` before the `if` condition.
