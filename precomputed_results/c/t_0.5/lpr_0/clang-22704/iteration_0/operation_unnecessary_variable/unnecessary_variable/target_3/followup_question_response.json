The label `i` is only used in the `goto` statement, which is never executed because of the recursive call to `fn1()` before it. Therefore, we can remove the label `i` and the assignment `f = 6L;` inside it.\n\n3. The variable `j` is not used in the recursive call to `fn1()`, so we can remove the assignment `j = 0xEEACFBBFL;` and the return statement `return j;` inside the label `i`.\n\n4. The function `fn1()` can be simplified as follows:\n```c\nchar fn1() {\n  fn1();\n}\n```\n\n5. The `main()` function is empty and does not perform any useful operations.
