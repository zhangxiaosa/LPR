The result of the assignment is then used in the condition `(ao - fn4(am - an, 0xECL)) - p2 & 1`.\n8. Since `ac` is always 1, the assignment `p2 = ac || (an = w) == 0x294A85636008822DLL` can be simplified to `p2 = 1`.\n9. The condition `(ao - fn4(am - an, 0xECL)) - p2 & 1` can be simplified to `(ao - fn4(am - an, 0xECL)) & 1`.\n10. The value of `p2` is not used after this point, so it can be optimized out.\n11.
