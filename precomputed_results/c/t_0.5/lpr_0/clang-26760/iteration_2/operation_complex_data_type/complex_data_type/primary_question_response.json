The program contains two nested `for` loops. The first `for` loop has `f` as the loop variable, and the second `for` loop uses `j` as the loop variable. The loops do not have any statements inside them.\n5. The program has a label `q`.\n6. The program performs the following operations:\n   - Right shifts the value of `k` by 1 (`k = k >> 1`).\n   - Checks if the value of `g` is non-zero.\n   - If `g` is non-zero, left shifts the value of `k` by `j` (`k = k << j`) and jumps to the label `q`.\n7.
