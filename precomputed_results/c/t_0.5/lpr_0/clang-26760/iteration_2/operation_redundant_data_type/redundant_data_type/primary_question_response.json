The program starts with the declaration of the variable `g` of type `int`.\n2. The `main` function is defined.\n3. Inside the `main` function:\n   - The variable `i` is declared as type `int`.\n   - The variable `j` is declared as type `int` and assigned the hexadecimal value `0x24F96B7B`.\n   - The variable `k` is declared as type `unsigned int`.\n   - A `for` loop is initialized with the variable `f` declared as type `unsigned int`. The loop continues as long as `f` is non-zero.\n     - Inside the nested `for` loop, the variable `j` is decremented until it becomes zero.\n   - A label `q` is defined.\n   - The variable `k` is right-shifted by 1.\n   - An `if` statement checks if `g` is non-zero.\n     - If true, the variable `k` is left-shifted by the value of `j`.\n     - The program jumps to the label `q` using `goto q`.\n4. The `}` denotes the end of the `main` function.\n5.
