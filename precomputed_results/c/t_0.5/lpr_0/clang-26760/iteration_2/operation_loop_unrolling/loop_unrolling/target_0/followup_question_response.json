Loop unrolling is a technique that reduces loop overhead by executing multiple loop iterations in a single iteration. Here's the step-by-step analysis and modification of the program:\n\n1. The target loop `for (; j; --j)` is a loop that iterates as long as `j` is non-zero and decrements `j` by 1 in each iteration.\n\n2. To unroll the loop, we can manually expand it by executing multiple iterations within a single loop. Let's unroll it by a factor of 4:\n\n```cpp\nfor (; j >= 4; j -= 4) {\n  // Iteration 1\n  // No operations\n\n  // Iteration 2\n  // No operations\n\n  // Iteration 3\n  // No operations\n\n  // Iteration 4\n  // No operations\n}\n```\n\n3. After unrolling, we need to handle the remaining iterations if `j` is not divisible by 4. We can add a conditional check to handle the remaining iterations:\n\n```cpp\nfor (; j >= 4; j -= 4) {\n  // Iteration 1\n  // No operations\n\n  // Iteration 2\n  // No operations\n\n  // Iteration 3\n  // No operations\n\n  // Iteration 4\n  // No operations\n}\n\n// Handle remaining iterations\nfor (; j; --j) {\n  // No operations\n}\n```\n\n4.

Inside the loop body, perform the necessary operations four times and decrement `j` by 4 in each iteration.\n\n5. After the loop, add the remaining iterations of the loop that are less than 4.

Determine the loop termination condition: The loop terminates when the variable `j` becomes zero.\n\n2. Identify the loop body: The loop body consists of the statement `--j`, which decrements the value of `j` by one.\n\n3. Decide on the loop unrolling factor: Determine the number of times the loop body should be replicated. This factor depends on the specific optimization goals and trade-offs. Let's assume a loop unrolling factor of 4 for this example.\n\n4. Unroll the loop: Replicate the loop body the specified number of times.

Initialize a variable `unroll_factor` to 4 (the number of times we want to unroll the loop).\n2. Calculate the number of iterations in the original loop by dividing `j` by `unroll_factor`. Let's call this value `num_iterations`.\n3. Initialize a new variable `unrolled_j` to `j`.\n4.
