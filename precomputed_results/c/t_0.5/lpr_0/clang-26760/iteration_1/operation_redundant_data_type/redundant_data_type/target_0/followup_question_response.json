The program declares a signed variable `g` at the global scope.\n\n2. The `main` function is defined.\n\n3. Inside the `main` function:\n   - A signed variable `i` is declared.\n   - An integer variable `j` is initialized with the hexadecimal value `0x24F96B7B`.\n   - An unsigned variable `k` is declared.\n   - A for loop is initialized with an unsigned variable `f` as the loop control variable. The loop continues as long as `f` is non-zero.\n   - Inside the first for loop, another for loop is initialized with no initialization, condition, or iteration expression. It simply decrements the `j` variable until it becomes zero.\n   - After the nested for loops, an integer variable `m` is initialized with the value of `j`.\n   - A signed variable `n` is initialized with the value of `g`.\n   - An integer variable `o` is initialized with the value of `n`.\n   - An unsigned variable `p` is initialized with the value of `o`.\n\n4.
