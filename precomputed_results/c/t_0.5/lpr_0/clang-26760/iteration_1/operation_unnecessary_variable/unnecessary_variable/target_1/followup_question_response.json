Initialize variables:\n   - `g` is initialized but not used in the program.\n   - `i` is initialized but its value is never used.\n   - `j` is initialized with the hexadecimal value `0x24F96B7B`.\n   - `k` is uninitialized.\n\n2.

Inner loop:\n   - The inner loop `for (; j; --j)` iterates until `j` becomes zero. Since `j` is initialized with a non-zero value, the loop will execute.\n   - The loop body is empty, so it does not affect the program state.\n\n4. Assignments:\n   - `m` is assigned the value of `j` after the inner loop. Since `j` is always zero after the loop, `m` will be zero.\n   - `n` is assigned the value of `g`, which is never modified.
