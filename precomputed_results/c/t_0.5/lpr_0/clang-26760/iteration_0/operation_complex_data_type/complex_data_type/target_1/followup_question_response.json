In the `main` function:\n   - Initialize `i` as a signed integer: `signed int i;`\n   - Initialize `j` as an integer with a hexadecimal value: `int j = 0x24F96B7B;`\n   - Initialize `k` as an unsigned integer: `unsigned int k;`\n   - Start a `for` loop with an uninitialized unsigned integer `f` as the loop variable.\n   - Inside the first `for` loop, start another `for` loop with no initialization or condition, and decrement `j` in each iteration.\n   - Initialize `l` as an integer with the suffix `L`: `int l = 1L;`\n   - Initialize `m` as an integer with the value of `j`: `int m = j;`\n   - Initialize `n` as a signed integer with the value of `g`: `signed int n = g;`\n   - Initialize `o` as an integer with the value of `n`: `int o = n;`\n   - Initialize `p` as an unsigned integer with the value of `o`: `unsigned int p = o;`\n   - Define a label `q`.\n   - Right-shift `k` by the value of `l`: `k = k >> l;`\n   - Assign the value of `p` to `i`: `i = p;`\n   - Check if `i` is non-zero.\n   - If `i` is non-zero, left-shift `k` by the value of `m` and jump to the label `q`.\n3.
