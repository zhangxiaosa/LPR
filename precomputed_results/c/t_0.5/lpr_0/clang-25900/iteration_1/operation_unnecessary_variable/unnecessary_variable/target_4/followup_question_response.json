Here's the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. The variable `p2` is passed as an argument to the function `fn1()`.\n2. Inside `fn1()`, the value of `p2` is returned directly. This means `p2` is not modified within the function.\n3. In the `main()` function, the return value of `fn1()` is assigned to `ad.o`. Since `fn1()` returns `p2` directly, we can replace `ad.o = fn1(v, 5)` with `ad.o = 5`.\n4. The value of `ad.o` is then assigned to `ae` using `ae = ad.o`. So, we can replace `ae = ad.o` with `ae = 5`.\n5. The value of `u` is assigned to `ad.o` using `ad.o = u`. If `u` is not modified later, we can replace `ad.o = u` with `ad.o = <value of u>`. However, the value of `u` is not provided in the given code, so we cannot perform this optimization without more information.\n6. The expression `t % (~s / ae)` is assigned to `r`. Since `s` is a static variable with a known value of -5, and `ae` is assigned the constant value of 5, we can simplify this expression to `t % (~(-5) / 5)` or `t % (-6 / 5)`.\n7.
