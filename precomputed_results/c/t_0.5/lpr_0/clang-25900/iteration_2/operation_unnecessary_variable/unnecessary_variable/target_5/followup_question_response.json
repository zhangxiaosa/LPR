If `p2` is used, check if its value can be determined at compile-time.\n5. If `p2` has a constant value, replace all occurrences of `p2` with its constant value.\n6. If `p2` is assigned to another variable, replace all occurrences of that variable with the value of `p2`.\n7. Repeat steps 4-6 until no more optimizations can be made.\n\nBased on the provided program, the variable `p2` is used as a parameter in the `fn1` function call: `ad.o = fn1(0, 5);`.
