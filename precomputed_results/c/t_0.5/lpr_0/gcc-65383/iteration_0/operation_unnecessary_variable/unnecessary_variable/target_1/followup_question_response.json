The function `fn2` is defined, which returns an unsigned integer.\n3. Inside `fn2`, there is a loop that runs indefinitely (`for (;;)`) with the following steps:\n   - Variable `q` is declared and initialized with the value `0xC3L`.\n   - An integer array `r2` is declared with dimensions `[5][9][5]`.\n   - If `h2` is non-zero, the function returns the value of `q`.\n   - Otherwise, the value of `r2[i][i][i]` is assigned to the global variable `g`.\n4.
