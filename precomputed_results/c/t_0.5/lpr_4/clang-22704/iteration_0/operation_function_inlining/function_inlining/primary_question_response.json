Next, there is a struct declaration: `struct c { a d; a e; };`. This defines a struct type named `c` with two members of type `a` (which is an alias for `int`).\n\n3. After the struct declaration, there is a variable declaration: `struct c f;`. This declares a variable named `f` of type `struct c`.\n\n4. The next part of the program is the definition of a function named `fn1()`. It has a return type of `b` (which is an alias for `char`). The function body contains several statements, including variable declarations, an if statement, a goto statement, function calls, and a return statement.\n\n5. Finally, there is the definition of the `main()` function, which has a return type of `int`.
