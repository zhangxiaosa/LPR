The variable `j` is initialized with the hexadecimal value `0x24F96B7B` inside the function `fn1()`. It is then used in a nested loop, but its value is not modified within the loop. Therefore, the loop iterations are effectively a no-op. The value of `j` remains the same throughout the loop, and its final value is assigned to the variable `m`. We can optimize out the loop and assign `m` directly with the initial value of `j`.\n\n3. The variable `p` is assigned the value of `g`, which is an `int` declared outside of any function. Since `g` is not used in the program, we can optimize out the assignment to `p`.\n\n4. The variable `k` is declared as an `unsigned` inside the function `fn1()`.
