Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. The program includes the standard input/output library `<stdio.h>`.\n2. The program defines a global variable `g` of type `int`.\n3. The program defines a function `fn1` that returns a `short`.\n4. Inside `fn1`, the following variables are declared:\n   - `i` of type `int`\n   - `j` of type `int` and initialized with the hexadecimal value `0x24F96B7B`\n   - `k` of type `unsigned int`\n   - `f` of type `unsigned int` (used in a loop but not initialized)\n   - `l` of type `int` and initialized with the value `1`\n   - `m` of type `int` and assigned the value of `j`\n   - `n` of type `int` and assigned the value of `g`\n   - `o` of type `int` and assigned the value of `n`\n   - `p` of type `unsigned int` and assigned the value of `o`\n5. The program enters a loop with the condition `f` (which is uninitialized), followed by an inner loop with the condition `j`.\n6. Inside the loop, `j` is decremented until it reaches `0`.\n7. The value of `l` is used to shift the bits of `k` to the right (`k = k >> l`).\n8. The value of `p` is assigned to `i`.\n9. If `i` is non-zero, the bits of `k` are shifted to the left by the value of `m` (`k = k << m`), and the program jumps to the label `q`.\n10. The function `main` is defined but does not contain any code.\n\nTo convert the variable `g` into primary data types, we can replace it with an equivalent variable of the desired type.
