Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:\n\n1. The program includes the standard input/output library `stdio.h`.\n\n2. It declares a global variable `g` of type `int`.\n\n3. It defines a function `fn1` with a return type of `short`.\n\n4. Inside the `fn1` function:\n   - It declares a local variable `i` of type `int`.\n   - It initializes a local variable `j` of type `int` with the hexadecimal value `0x24F96B7B`.\n   - It declares an unsigned local variable `k` of type `unsigned int`.\n   - It initializes an unsigned local variable `f` of type `unsigned int` in a for loop with an empty condition.\n   - It contains a nested for loop with the condition `j` and decrements `j` in each iteration.\n   - It assigns the value of `j` to a local variable `m` of type `int`.\n   - It assigns the value of the global variable `g` to an unsigned local variable `p` of type `unsigned int`.\n   - It defines a label `q` for a goto statement.\n   - It performs a right shift operation on `k` by 1.\n   - It assigns the value of `p` to `i`.\n   - It checks if `i` is non-zero and enters an if statement.\n   - Inside the if statement, it performs a left shift operation on `k` by the value of `m`.\n   - It uses a goto statement to jump to the label `q`.\n\n5.
