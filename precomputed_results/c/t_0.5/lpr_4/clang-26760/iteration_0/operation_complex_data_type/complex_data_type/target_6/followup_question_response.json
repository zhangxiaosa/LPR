Variable Declaration and Initialization:\n   - `int l = 1;`: The variable `l` is declared and initialized with the value 1.\n\n2. Usage of Variable `l`:\n   - `k = k >> l;`: The value of `l` is used as the shift amount for the right shift operation on variable `k`.\n\nOptimization Analysis:\nSince the value of `l` is a constant 1, the right shift operation `k = k >> l;` is equivalent to dividing `k` by 2.
