The function `fn1` is called with arguments `v` and `5`, but the return value is not used. Therefore, we can eliminate the function call and directly assign `5` to `ad.o`.\n\n3. The variable `ae` is assigned the value of `ad.o`, which is `5`. Since `ad.o` is a constant, we can replace all occurrences of `ae` with `5`.\n\n4. The line `ad.o = v;` can be removed as `v` is no longer used.\n\n5. The expression `t % (~s / ae)` can be simplified further. Since `s` is a static variable with the value `-5`, `~s` will be `4`. Therefore, the expression becomes `t % (4 / ae)`. Since `ae` is a constant with the value `5`, the expression can be simplified to `t % (4 / 5)`.\n\n6.

In the `main` function:\n   - The variable `v` is used as an argument in the function call `fn1(v, 5)`. Since `fn1` returns the value of its second parameter, which is `p2`, the assignment `ad.o = fn1(v, 5);` can be simplified to `ad.o = 5;` using constant propagation.\n   - The value of `ad.o` is then assigned to the variable `ae` using copy propagation: `ae = ad.o;`.\n   - The value of `v` is assigned to `ad.o`: `ad.o = v;`. Since `ad.o` is not used later, this assignment can be removed.\n\n3. The value of `t` is divided by `ae`, and the result is used in the expression `r = t % (~s / ae);`. Since `ae` is assigned the value of `ad.o` and `ad.o` is assigned the value of `v`, we can replace `ae` with `v` in the expression.\n\n4.
