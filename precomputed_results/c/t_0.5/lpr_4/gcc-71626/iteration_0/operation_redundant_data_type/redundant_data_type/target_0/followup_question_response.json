The program defines a function named `fn2` that returns a value of type `d`. Inside `fn2`, there are the following statements:\n   - `a c = fn1;`: This declares a variable `c` of type `a` and initializes it with the value of the function `fn1`. However, `fn1` is not a value; it is a function, so this line is invalid.\n   - `d f = {c};`: This declares a variable `f` of type `d` and initializes it with the value of `c`. Since `c` is of type `a`, which is an alias for `long`, this line is also invalid.\n   - `return f;`: This returns the value of `f`, which is of type `d`.\n\n5.
