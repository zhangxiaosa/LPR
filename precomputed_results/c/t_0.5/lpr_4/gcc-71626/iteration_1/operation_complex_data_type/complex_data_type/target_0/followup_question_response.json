The program includes a function declaration `fn1()` and a function definition `fn2()`.\n2. The `fn1()` function is declared but not defined, so we don't have any information about its implementation.\n3. The `fn2()` function is defined and returns a variable of type `d`.\n4. The `d` type is defined using a `typedef` statement with the `__vector_size__` attribute, indicating that it is a vector type with a size equal to `sizeof(long)`. This suggests that `d` is a complex data type representing a vector of `long` values.\n5. Inside the `fn2()` function, a variable `c` of type `long` is declared and initialized with the value of `fn1`.\n6. Another variable `f` of type `d` is declared and initialized with a single element vector containing the value of `c`.\n7. Finally, the variable `f` is returned from the `fn2()` function.\n8. The `main()` function is empty.\n\nTo decompose the program into variables with primary data types, we need to replace the complex data type `d` with a primary data type that represents the same kind of data. Since `d` is a vector type with a size equal to `sizeof(long)`, we can replace it with an array of `long` values.\n\nModified program:\n\n```c\ntypedef long d[sizeof(long)];\n\nlong fn2() {\n  long c = fn1;\n  d f = {c};\n  return f[0];\n}\n\nint main() {\n  // main function body\n  return 0;\n}\n```\n\nHere, the `d` type has been replaced with `long` array type.
