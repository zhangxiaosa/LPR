Loop unrolling is a technique that involves duplicating loop iterations to reduce the overhead of loop control and improve performance.

Identify the loop to be optimized: `for (;;) { ... }`\n\n2. Determine the number of iterations in the loop:\n   Since the loop condition is `for (;;)`, which is an infinite loop, the number of iterations is infinite.\n\n3. Apply loop unrolling:\n   Since the loop is infinite, we can remove the loop control and duplicate the loop body code multiple times to achieve the same effect.
