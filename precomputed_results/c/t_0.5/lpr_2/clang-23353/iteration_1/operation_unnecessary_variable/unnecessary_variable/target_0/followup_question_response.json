The target variable to be optimized is `p1`.\n2. We need to analyze the program and identify all the places where `p1` is used or assigned a value.\n3. The program consists of a function `fn1` and the `main` function.\n4. In the `fn1` function, `p1` is a parameter and is used to calculate the return value by multiplying it with `p2`. However, since `p1` is not used anywhere else in the program, we can optimize it out in the `fn1` function.\n5. In the `main` function, `p3` is assigned a value in a loop. Inside the loop, `fn1` is called with `p3` and `i` as arguments. The return value of `fn1` is then bitwise XORed with `j` and `1L`. However, `p1` is not used in this calculation, so we can optimize out the call to `fn1` and remove the dependency on `p1`.\n6. After optimizing out `p1`, the modified `main` function becomes:\n```c\nint main() {\n  signed p3;\n  for (p3 = 6; p3 != -7; p3--)\n    j ^= 1L;\n}\n```\n7.

The program has two variables `i` and `j`, but they are not related to the target variable `p1`.\n\n3. The function `fn1` takes two parameters `p1` and `p2`, but since `p1` is not used in the program, we can consider it as an unused variable.\n\n4. The for loop iterates over the variable `p3` from 6 to -7 (inclusive) with a decrement of 1. Inside the loop, the function `fn1` is called with `p3` and `i` as arguments. However, since `p1` is not used in the program, the result of `fn1` is not used either.\n\n5. The result of the logical AND operation `&&` between the result of `fn1(p3, i)` and the constant value `1L` is assigned to the variable `j` using the XOR assignment operator `^=`.
