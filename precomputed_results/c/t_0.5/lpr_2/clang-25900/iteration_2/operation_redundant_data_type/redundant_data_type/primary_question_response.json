The program starts with the declaration of a function `fn1` that takes an argument `p2` and returns an unsigned value. No redundant data types are identified in this function.\n\n2. The program defines a structure `m` with two bit fields `n` and `o`. The bit fields have the `signed` data type specified. The `signed` data type is redundant in this case because the default data type for bit fields is `int`.\n\n3. The program declares variables `r`, `s`, and `t` of type `unsigned`, `signed`, and `unsigned`, respectively. No redundant data types are identified in these declarations.\n\n4.

The value of `ad.o` is assigned to the variable `ae`. No redundant data types are identified in this assignment.\n\n8. The value of `ad.o` is assigned to `ad.o` itself.
