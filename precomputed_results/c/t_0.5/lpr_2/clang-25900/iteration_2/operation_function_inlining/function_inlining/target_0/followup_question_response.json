Here's the step-by-step analysis and modified program:\n\n1. The `fn1` function takes a parameter `p2` and returns it. Since it is a simple function with no side effects, we can replace all the calls to `fn1` with the value of its parameter.\n\n2. In the `main` function, the line `ad.o = fn1(5);` can be replaced with `ad.o = 5;` since `fn1(5)` is equivalent to `5`.\n\n3. In the line `ae = ad.o;`, `ad.o` can be replaced with `5` since it was assigned the value `5` in the previous step.\n\n4. The line `ad.o = ad.o;` does not have any effect and can be removed.\n\n5. The expression `~s / ae` can be simplified to `-1 / ae` since `~s` is equivalent to `-1` for a signed variable `s` initialized with `-5L`.\n\n6. The line `r = t % (-1 / ae);` can be simplified to `r = t % (-1 / 5);` since `ae` is assigned the value `5` in the previous step.\n\n7. The expression `-1 / 5` can be further simplified to `0` since integer division rounds towards zero.\n\n8. The line `r = t % 0;` will result in a runtime error since it attempts to perform modulo division by zero. To avoid this error, we can remove this line or handle the case when the divisor is zero.\n\n9.
