The program defines a structure `m` with two signed fields `n` and `o`. The structure `ad` of type `m` is declared and initialized with the values `{1957, fn1(5)}`. Since `fn1` is optimized out, the initialization becomes `{1957, 5}`.\n\n3. The program declares a signed variable `ae`.\n\n4. The value of `ad.o` is assigned to `ae`. Since `ad.o` is initialized to `5`, `ae` becomes `5`.\n\n5. The value of `ad.o` is assigned back to `ad.o`. This assignment has no effect and can be optimized out.\n\n6. The value of `s` is `-5`, and the value of `ae` is `5`. The expression `~s / ae` evaluates to `~(-5) / 5`, which is `4 / 5`. Since both `4` and `5` are constants, this expression can be evaluated at compile time to `0`.\n\n7. The value of `4 % 0` is undefined behavior in C/C++.
