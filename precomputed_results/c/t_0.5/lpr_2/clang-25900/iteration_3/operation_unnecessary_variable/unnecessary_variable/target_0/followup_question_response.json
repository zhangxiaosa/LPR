Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. The variable `ad` is initialized with the constant values `{1957, fn1(5)}`. Since `fn1(5)` returns the value `5`, we can replace `ad` with `{1957, 5}` throughout the program.\n\n2. The variable `ae` is assigned the value `ad.o`. Since `ad.o` is a constant value of `5`, we can replace `ae = ad.o` with `ae = 5`.\n\n3. The expression `ad.o = ad.o` has no effect and can be removed.\n\n4. The expression `r = t % (~s / ae)` can be simplified using constant propagation and copy propagation. Since `s` is a constant value of `-5`, we can replace `~s` with `4`. Also, since `ae` is a constant value of `5`, we can replace `ae` with `5`. Therefore, the expression simplifies to `r = t % (4 / 5)`.\n\n5.
