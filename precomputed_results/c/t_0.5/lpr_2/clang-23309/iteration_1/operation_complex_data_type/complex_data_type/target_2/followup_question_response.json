Let's analyze the dependencies:\n\n1. `ao` is assigned the value `0xBCD1` inside the `if (an = 250)` block. This assignment is necessary and cannot be optimized.\n2. The value of `an` is determined by the loop variable `w` and the condition `an = w` inside the `if (an = 250)` block. This dependency is necessary for the program logic and cannot be optimized.\n3. The function `fn4` is called with arguments `fn6(1, an)` and `0xEC`, which affects the value of `ao`. This dependency is necessary for the program logic and cannot be optimized.\n4. The value of `ac` affects the value of `ao` through the subtraction `ao - ac`. If `ac` is always `1`, this subtraction can be simplified to `ao - 1`.
