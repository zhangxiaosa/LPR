The program defines two typedefs: `typedef unsigned e;` and `typedef unsigned f;`. We need to eliminate the `e` typedef and substitute it with its associated original data type, which is `unsigned`.\n\n2. The program defines a struct `h` with three members: `signed i;`, `long j;`, and `unsigned k;`. No changes are required for this struct.\n\n3. The program declares an unsigned variable `l`. No changes are required for this variable.\n\n4. The program defines a static function `fn1()` that returns a struct `h`. No changes are required for this function.\n\n5. The program defines a function `fn2()` that takes an argument `p1` of type `e` (which needs to be substituted). Inside the function, a variable `p` of type `struct h` is declared. The function calls `fn1()` with arguments `l` and `p`. We need to substitute the argument type `e` with `unsigned`.\n\n6. Inside the `fn2()` function, there is a `for` loop that declares a variable `r` of type `struct h`. The assignment `p = r = p;` assigns the value of `p` to `r` and then assigns the value of `r` back to `p`. No changes are required for this loop.\n\n7. The program defines the `fn1()` function that takes arguments `p1` of type `f` (which needs to be substituted) and `p5` of type `struct h`. Inside the function, `p5.k;` is accessed. We need to substitute the argument type `f` with `unsigned`.\n\n8. The `fn1()` function contains a `goto` statement labeled `w`. No changes are required for this statement.\n\n9.
