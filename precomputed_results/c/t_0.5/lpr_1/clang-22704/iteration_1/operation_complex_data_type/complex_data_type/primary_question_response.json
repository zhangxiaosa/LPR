The \"fn1\" function returns a long integer value \"0xEEACFBBFL\", which is not a complex data type.\n7. The \"fn1\" function has a label \"i\" that is used with a goto statement. Labels are not variables and do not have data types.\n8. Inside the \"i\" label, the program assigns a long integer value \"6L\" to the \"f.d\" variable.
