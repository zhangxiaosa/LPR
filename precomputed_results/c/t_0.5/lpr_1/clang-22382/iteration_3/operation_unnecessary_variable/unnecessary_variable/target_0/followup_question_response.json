The target variable to be optimized is `i`.\n\n2. In the `main` function, there are no references or modifications to the variable `i`. Therefore, it can be safely optimized out.\n\n3. In the `fn1_k` function, the variable `p5` of type `struct h` is passed as a parameter. The `k` member of `p5` is accessed but not used further. Since the variable `i` is not involved in `fn1_k`, it does not affect the optimization of `i` in the `fn2` function.\n\n4. In the `fn2` function, the `fn1_k` function is called with the `p` variable as an argument. However, the result of the function call is not used or assigned to any variable. Therefore, the call to `fn1_k(p)` does not affect the optimization of `i`.\n\n5. Inside the infinite loop in the `fn2` function, a local variable `r` of type `struct h` is declared. Then, the variables `p` and `r` are assigned the value of `p` using the assignment operator `=`. Since `p` and `r` have the same value, the assignment `r = p` can be optimized out.\n\n6. After the optimization, the program becomes:\n\n```c\nstruct h {\n  int i;\n  long j;\n  int k;\n};\n\nunsigned fn2() {\n  struct h p;\n  for (;;) {\n    struct h r;\n    p = p;\n  }\n}\n\nint main() {}\n```\n\n7.
