Therefore, we can unroll the loop by manually repeating the loop body multiple times.\n\nHere's the step-by-step analysis and modification of the program:\n\n1. Remove the loop construct: Since the loop is an infinite loop, we can remove the loop construct entirely.\n\n2. Unroll the loop body: The loop body statement `p = r = p;` can be repeated multiple times to achieve loop unrolling.\n\n3.

Loop unrolling is a technique where the loop is manually expanded by duplicating its body multiple times. In this case, since the loop contains only a single statement, we can simply replace the loop with multiple copies of that statement.\n\nHere's the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. In the `fn1_k` function, the loop `goto w;` is a simple infinite loop that jumps back to the `w` label. Since there are no statements within the loop body, the loop does not have any effect and can be optimized out.\n\n2. To optimize the loop, we can remove the loop entirely and replace it with a single copy of the loop body statement. In this case, the loop body statement is `goto w;`, so we can remove the loop and replace it with `goto w;` directly.\n\n3. After the optimization, the `fn1_k` function will be simplified to:\n\n```c\nint fn1_k(struct h p5) {\n  p5.k;\n  goto w;\n}\n```\n\n4. The `goto w;` statement is now the last statement in the function, and it will create an infinite loop.\n\n5. The `fn2` function calls `fn1_k` and then enters an infinite loop. Since the `fn1_k` function now contains an infinite loop, the `fn2` function will also have an infinite loop.\n\n6.
