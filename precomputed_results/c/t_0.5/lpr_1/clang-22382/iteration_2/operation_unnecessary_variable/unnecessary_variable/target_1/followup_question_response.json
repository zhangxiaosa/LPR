The target variable to be optimized is `p5` in the function `fn1_k`.\n2. Since `p5` is not used anywhere in the program, it can be optimized out completely.\n3. To optimize `p5` out, we can remove the parameter `p5` from the function `fn1_k`.\n4. After removing the parameter, the function `fn1_k` becomes:\n```c\nint fn1_k() {\n  w: ;\n  goto w;\n}\n```\n5. The function `fn1_k` is now an infinite loop with no side effects.\n6. The main function is empty and can also be removed.\n7. The `fn2` function calls `fn1_k` with the `p` variable, but since `p5` is no longer a parameter of `fn1_k`, the call can be updated to `fn1_k()`.\n8. The `for` loop in `fn2` assigns `p` to `r` and then assigns `r` back to `p`. This can be simplified to just `p = p;`, which does nothing.\n9. The simplified `fn2` function becomes:\n```c\nunsigned fn2() {\n  struct h p;\n  fn1_k();\n  for (;;) {\n    p = p;\n  }\n}\n```\n10. The program can be further simplified by removing the unused struct members `i` and `j` from the `struct h` definition.\n11.

In the `fn1_k` function, the `p5.k` statement has no effect and can be optimized out.\n4.

The program defines a struct `h` with three members: `i`, `j`, and `k`.\n2. There is a static function `fn1_k` that takes a struct `h` as an argument and returns an `int`. However, the function is declared before it is used, so it should be declared or defined before the `fn2` function.\n3. The `fn2` function is defined as an `unsigned` function. It declares a local variable `p` of type `struct h` and calls the `fn1_k` function passing `p` as an argument.\n4. Inside the `fn2` function, there is an infinite loop (`for (;;)`) that declares a local variable `r` of type `struct h`. It then assigns `p` to `r` and assigns `r` back to `p`. This assignment is redundant and can be optimized out.\n5. The `fn1_k` function takes a `struct h` argument `p5` but does nothing with it except accessing its member `k`. This function has an infinite loop (`w:; goto w;`) that results in an infinite loop in the `fn2` function as well.\n6.
