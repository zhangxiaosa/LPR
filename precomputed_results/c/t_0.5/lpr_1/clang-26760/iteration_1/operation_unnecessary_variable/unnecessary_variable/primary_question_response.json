The program defines a global variable `g` of type `unsigned`.\n\n2. The `main()` function begins.\n\n3. Inside the `main()` function, the following variables are defined:\n   - `int j` with an initial value of `0x24F96B7B`.\n   - `unsigned k` without an initial value.\n\n4. There is an `if` statement that checks the value of `j`. If `j` is non-zero, the following code block is executed:\n   - `--j` decrements the value of `j`.\n\n5. There is a label `q` followed by a semicolon (`q:;`).\n\n6. The variable `k` is shifted right by 1 bit (`k = k >> 1L`).\n\n7. There is another `if` statement that checks the value of `g`. If `g` is non-zero, the following code block is executed:\n   - `k` is shifted left by the value of `j`.\n   - The program jumps to the `q` label using `goto q;`.\n\n8. The `main()` function ends.\n\nBased on this analysis, the intermediate or unused variables in the program are:\n- `j` (intermediate variable)\n- `k` (intermediate variable)\n\nTo summarize, the identified variables are `j` and `k`.
