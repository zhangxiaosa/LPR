Replace the assignment `ad.o = fn1(5)` with `ad.o = 5`, as the function `fn1` simply returns its argument.\n3. Replace the assignment `ae = ad.o` with `ae = 5`, as `ad.o` is assigned the constant value `5` in the previous step.\n4.

Simplify the expression `~-5L / 5` to `-(-5L / 5)`, as the bitwise negation operator `~` cancels out with the negation operator `-`.\n7. Simplify the expression `(-5L / 5)` to `-1L`, as the division of a negative number by a positive number results in a negative quotient.\n8.
