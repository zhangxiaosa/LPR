The `fn1` function is called four times, each time with a different value of `fn1` as an argument. The values returned by these calls are stored in the `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, and `x4` variables, respectively. The `fn2` function returns a `d` variable that is constructed from these four values.\n\nThis version of the program should be more efficient than the original, as it avoids the overhead of creating and destroying a large number of vector objects. However, it may also make the code more difficult to read and maintain, as the individual variables must be kept in sync with the original vector.",
