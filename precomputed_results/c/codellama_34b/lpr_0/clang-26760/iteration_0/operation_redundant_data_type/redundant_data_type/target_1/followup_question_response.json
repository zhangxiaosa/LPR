The program is using the `int` data type for some variables, and the `unsigned` data type for others.\n\nTo eliminate the `typedef`s and substitute every instance of them with their associated original data types, we need to replace the following lines of code:\n```\ntypedef int c;\ntypedef unsigned d;\ntypedef unsigned e;\n```\nWith the following lines of code:\n```\n#include <stdint.h>\n\nint32_t c;\nuint32_t d;\nuint32_t e;\n```\nThe `stdint.h` header file provides a set of typedefs for integer types with specified widths, such as `int32_t` and `uint32_t`. These types are guaranteed to have the same size and representation on all platforms, so they can be used to ensure portability of the code.\n\nThe rest of the program remains unchanged, as the `typedef`s were only being used to create type aliases for the data types.\n\nHere is the complete program with the modifications:\n```\n#include <stdint.h>\n\nint main() {\n  int32_t i;\n  int32_t j = 0x24F96B7BL;\n  uint32_t k;\n  int32_t l = 1L;\n  int32_t m = j;\n  int32_t n = g;\n  uint32_t o = n;\n  uint32_t p = o;\nq:;\n  k = k >> l;\n  i = p;\n  if (i) {\n    k = k << m;\n    goto q;\n  }\n}\n```\nNote that I have also added the `<stdint.h>` header file to the program, as it is required to use the `int32_t` and `uint32_t` types.",
