The idea behind loop unrolling is to replace the loop with a set of instructions that perform the same operation as the loop, but with fewer branches and less overhead.\n\nIn this case, we can unroll the loop by a factor of 4, which means that we will replace the loop with 4 copies of the loop body, each of which will be executed sequentially. Here is the optimized program:\n```\nunsigned f;\nint g;\nint main() {\n  int i;\n  unsigned j = 0x24F96B7BL;\n  unsigned k;\n\n  // Unrolled loop\n  for (f = 0; f < 4; f++) {\n    // Body of the inner loop\n    j = j - 1;\n  }\n\n  int n = g;\n  while (n) {\n    k = k >> 1L;\n    i = n;\n    if (i)\n      k = k << j;\n  }\n}\n```\nThe optimized program is faster because it has fewer branches and less overhead. The loop has been unrolled, which means that the loop body is executed 4 times in a row, without any branches or other overhead.\n\nThe resulting program is also more cache-friendly, because the loop body is executed in a contiguous block of instructions, which can be easily cached by the CPU.\n\nIn summary, loop unrolling is a simple and effective technique for optimizing loops in C programs. It can significantly improve the performance of the program by reducing the number of branches and overhead associated with the loop.",
