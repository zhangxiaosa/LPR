The first loop is a recursive loop, which is a type of loop that calls itself repeatedly until a certain condition is met. In this case, the loop is defined by the `fn1()` function, which calls itself recursively until `d_int` is equal to 6. The loop starts at line 3 and ends at line 8.\n2. The second loop is a while loop, which is a type of loop that repeats a set of statements as long as a certain condition is true. In this case, the loop starts at line 11 and ends at line 13. The loop repeats as long as `d_int` is less than 6.",
