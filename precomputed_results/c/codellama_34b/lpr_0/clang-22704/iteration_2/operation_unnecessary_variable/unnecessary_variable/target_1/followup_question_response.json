Constant propagation: The variable `d_int_value` is never modified within the function `fn1`, and its value is always `0`. Therefore, the expression `if (d_int_value)` can be replaced with `if (0)`, which is always false.\n2. Copy propagation: The variable `d_int_ptr` is assigned the value `6L` in the function `fn1`, but it is never used anywhere in the program. Therefore, the assignment `d_int_ptr = 6L` can be removed.\n3. Unused variable removal: The variable `d_int_ptr` is not used anywhere in the program, and can be removed.\n4. Dead code elimination: The function `fn1` is defined but not used anywhere in the program. Therefore, it can be removed.\n\nHere is the optimized program:\n```\nint fn1() {\n  return 0xEEACFBBFL;\n}\n\nint main() {}\n```",

Constant propagation:\nThe value of `d_int_value` is never changed in the program, so it can be considered a constant.

Copy propagation:\nThe variable `d_int_ptr` is never used in the program, so it can be removed. The function `fn1` does not have any side effects, so it can be safely optimized away.\n3.

Constant Propagation:\n\nWe can replace the constant value 0xEEACFBBFL with a constant variable `const_val` and assign it the value 0xEEACFBBFL. This will eliminate the usage of the constant value in the function and make the code more readable.\n```\nconst_val = 0xEEACFBBFL;\n\nint fn1() {\n  if (d_int_value)\n    goto j;\n  fn1();\n  return const_val;\nj:\n  d_int_ptr = 6L;\n  fn1();\n  return const_val;\n}\n```\n2.
