However, to optimize the program, we can use the following strategies:\n\n1. Inline Functions: Since the function `fn1` is only called once, we can inline it in the `main` function to reduce the overhead of function calls.\n2. Constant Folding: The constant `0xEEACFBBFL` can be folded into the assignment statement `j = 0xEEACFBBFL;`.\n3. Dead Code Elimination: The code in the `i` label can be eliminated since it is never reached.\n\nThe optimized program is as follows:\n```\nint d; // primary data type\nint e; // primary data type\n\nint fn1() {\n  int h = 6L; // primary data type\n  if (e)      // primary data type\n    goto i;   // primary data type\n  d = h;           // primary data type\n  j = 0xEEACFBBFL; // primary data type\n  return j;        // primary data type\n}\n\nint main() {\n  fn1();\n}\n```",
