In this case, the only complex data type is the structure variable `f`, which has two members: `e` and `h`.\n\nWe can then decompose the program into variables with primary data types by extracting the values of the complex data types and assigning them to new variables.\n\nFor example, we can extract the value of `f.e` and assign it to a new variable `e_val`:\n```\nint e_val = f.e;\n```\nWe can then use the value of `e_val` in the program instead of `f.e`.\n\nSimilarly, we can extract the value of `f.h` and assign it to a new variable `h_val`:\n```\nint h_val = f.h;\n```\nWe can then use the value of `h_val` in the program instead of `f.h`.\n\nThe resulting program with variables of primary data types would look like this:\n```\nint d;\nint e;\n\nint fn1() {\n  int h_val = 6L;\n  int e_val = f.e;\n  if (e_val)\n    goto i;\n  fn1();\n  int j;\n  return j;\ni:\n  d = h_val;\n  fn1();\n  j = 0xEEACFBBFL;\n  return j;\n}\n\nint main() {}\n```\nNote that the program still has the same functionality as the original program, but the complex data types have been replaced with variables of primary data types.",

Here are the primary data types that make up the complex data types in the program:\n\n1. `f.e`: This is a member of a structure variable, which is a complex data type. To decompose this variable, we need to consider the structure of the structure variable. Let's say the structure variable is defined as follows:\n```less\nstruct example {\n  int a;\n  int b;\n  int c;\n};\n```\nIn this case, `f.e` can be decomposed into three primary data types: `int a`, `int b`, and `int c`.\n2. `h`: This is an integer variable that is used to store the value of 6L. To decompose this variable, we need to consider the data type of the value being stored. In this case, the value being stored is an integer, so `h` can be decomposed into a single primary data type: `int`.\n3. `j`: This is an integer variable that is used to store the value returned by the `fn1` function. To decompose this variable, we need to consider the data type of the value being stored. In this case, the value being stored is an integer, so `j` can be decomposed into a single primary data type: `int`.\n4. `d`: This is an integer variable that is used to store the value of `f.e`. To decompose this variable, we need to consider the data type of the value being stored. In this case, the value being stored is an integer, so `d` can be decomposed into a single primary data type: `int`.\n\nTherefore, the final program with the variables decomposed into primary data types is:\n```less\nint a;\nint b;\nint c;\nint h;\nint j;\nint d;\n\nint fn1() {\n  a = 6L;\n  if (e)\n    goto i;\n  fn1();\n  j = 0xEEACFBBFL;\n  return j;\ni:\n  d = h;\n  fn1();\n  return j;\n}\n\nint main() {}\n```\nIn this final program, all the variables have been decomposed into primary data types, and the complex data types have been eliminated.",
