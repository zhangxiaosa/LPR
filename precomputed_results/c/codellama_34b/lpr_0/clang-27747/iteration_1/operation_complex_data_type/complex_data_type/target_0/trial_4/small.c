/* Decomposition of the program into variables with primary data types:

1. i.d : int (member of struct c)
2. j : int (global variable)
3. n : int (local variable)
4. l : struct c (local variable)
5. l.d : int (member of struct c)
6. l.f : int (member of struct c)

The target to be optimized is d: int (member of struct c).

The analysis of the program shows that the value of d is being modified in multiple places, and the optimization should be done carefully to ensure that the correct value is being used at each point.

The analysis also shows that the value of d is being used in a bitwise AND operation with another value, which may result in a different value for d. This should be taken into account when optimizing the program to ensure that the correct value is being used.

The optimization can be done by rewriting the program to use temporary variables for the intermediate values, which will make the code more readable and easier to maintain. Additionally, the compiler may be able to perform additional optimizations based on the temporary variables, which can further improve the performance of the program.
