The members `d`, `e`, and `f` are of type `int`, and the members `g` and `h` are of type `int`.\n\nTo decompose the variable `l` into variables with primary data types, we can define the following variables:\n```\nint l_d = l.d;\nint l_e = l.e;\nint l_f = l.f;\nint l_g = l.g;\nint l_h = l.h;\n```\nThese variables are now of primary data type and can be used in the program instead of the structure variable `l`.\n\nFor example, the statement `l.d = m` can be replaced with `l_d = m`, and the statement `int p = o | -(l.f && l.d) - n` can be replaced with `int p = o | -(l_f && l_d) - n`.\n\nThe optimized program using primary data types is:\n```\nint d = 18;\nint e = 6738;\nint f = 165;\nint g = 0;\nint h = 0;\n\nint l_d = 24;\nint l_e = 6738;\nint l_f = 165;\nint l_g = 0;\nint l_h = 0;\n\nint j = 0;\n\nint main() {\n  int m = j;\n  l_d = m;\n  int n = j && l_d;\n  int o = l_d;\n  int p = o | -(l_f && l_d) - n;\n  i.g = p;\n}\n```",
