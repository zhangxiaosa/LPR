Constant propagation:\n\nThe value of `l.f` is always 6738, so we can replace `l.f` with the constant value 6738 in the expression `l.f && l.d`. This gives us `l.d | -6738 - n`.\n\n2. Copy propagation:\n\nThe value of `l.d` is always the same, so we can replace `l.d` with the variable `m` in the expression `l.d | -l.f - n`.

Therefore, we cannot optimize it out completely. However, we can still perform some optimizations on the code that uses `l`.\n\nFirst, we can optimize the assignment to `l.d` by using a constant propagation. Since `m` is a constant, we can propagate its value to `l.d` and eliminate the assignment.
