Therefore, we can replace all occurrences of `i.d` with `o | -(l.f && l.d) - j && l.d`.\n5.

Copy propagation:\nThe variable `l` is a struct with two members, `d` and `f`. The struct is initialized with the values 24 and 6738, respectively. The variable `m` is assigned the value of `j`, which is initially uninitialized. The variable `n` is assigned the value of `j && l.d`, which is a logical AND operation between `j` and `l.d`. The variable `o` is assigned the value of `l.d`, which is a copy of `m`.\n2. Constant propagation:\nThe variable `n` is a constant, as it is the result of a logical AND operation between two constant values. Therefore, the expression `j && l.d` can be evaluated at compile-time and the result can be stored in a constant variable.\n3. Dead code elimination:\nThe variable `o` is not used in the program, so it can be eliminated.\n\nThe optimized code is:\n```\nstruct c {\n  int d : 18;\n  int f;\n};\nstruct c i;\nint j;\n\nint main() {\n  struct c l = {24, 6738};\n  int m = j;\n  l.d = m;\n  int n = 24 && 6738;\n  i.d = n | -(l.f && l.d) - n;\n}\n```",
