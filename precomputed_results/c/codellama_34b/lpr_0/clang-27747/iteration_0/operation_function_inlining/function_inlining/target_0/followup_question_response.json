The bitwise AND operation `j.h && l.d` has been simplified to `j.h && m` since `l.d` is always equal to `m`.

The `fn2()` function then modifies the `l` struct and returns a value that is stored in the `i.g` field.\n\nIn the optimized program, the `fn1()` function has been inlined into the `main()` function, so that the function call to `fn2()` is replaced with the contents of the `fn2()` function. This eliminates the overhead of the function call and allows the compiler to perform further optimizations.\n\nThe `fn2()` function has been modified to remove the unnecessary `l` struct initialization and the `fn1()` function has been modified to directly assign the return value of `fn2()` to the `i.g` field.\n\nIt's worth noting that the optimization may have changed the behavior of the program, depending on the side effects of the `fn2()` function.",
