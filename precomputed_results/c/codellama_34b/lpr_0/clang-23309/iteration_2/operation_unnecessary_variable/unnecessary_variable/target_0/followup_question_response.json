The result of this subtraction is then used as an argument to function `fn6` again, which is a simple subtraction operation.\n\nSince the value of `an` is constant throughout the execution of the `while` loop, we can optimize the program by replacing all occurrences of `an` with its constant value of 250UL. This will eliminate the need for the variable `an` and the associated memory allocation and deallocation.\n\nThe optimized code would look like this:\n```\nint fn12(int p1, int p2, d p3, short p4) {\n  short ao = 48873;\n  if (fn3(ao, fn6(1L, 250UL)) - p2 & 1UL)\n    v = 1UL;\n  return 0;\n}\n```\nIn this optimized code, the variable `an` has been eliminated, and its value of 250UL has been directly used in the calls to `fn6` and `fn3`.
