The optimizations were performed using constant propagation and copy propagation, which are two common techniques used in compiler optimization.\n\nIn the optimized program, the variable `an` has been propagated to be a constant value of `250L` throughout the program. This has allowed the compiler to eliminate the need for the variable `an` and replace it with the constant value in all instances where it is used.\n\nSimilarly, the variable `ao` has been propagated to be a constant value of `48873` throughout the program. This has allowed the compiler to eliminate the need for the variable `ao` and replace it with the constant value in all instances where it is used.\n\nOverall, the optimized program has been simplified and improved in performance by eliminating the need for unnecessary variables and replacing them with constant values.",
