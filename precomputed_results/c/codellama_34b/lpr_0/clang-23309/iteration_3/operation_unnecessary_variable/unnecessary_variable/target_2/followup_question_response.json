Constant propagation:\nThe constant values in the program are propagated throughout the code, so that the same value is not recomputed multiple times. For example, the constant `250L` is propagated to the `an` variable in the `fn12` function, and the constant `1L` is propagated to the `ao` variable in the `fn3` function.\n2. Copy propagation:\nThe `p` variable is not used in the program, so it can be optimized out. The `p` variable is assigned the value of `v` in the `main` function, but `v` is not used anywhere else in the program. Therefore, the `p` variable can be eliminated, and the `v` variable can be used directly in the `printf` statement.\n\nThe optimized program is shorter and more efficient than the original program, as it eliminates unnecessary computations and variables.",

This is possible because the value of `v` is not modified anywhere in the program, and it is always the same value `1L` throughout the execution of the program.\n\nTherefore, the optimized program is equivalent to the original program in terms of its functionality, but it is faster and more efficient because it eliminates the unnecessary computation and function calls.",

Therefore, the entire program can be optimized to a single statement that prints the checksum:\n```\nprintf(\"checksum = %X\\n\", 0);\n```\nThis is a constant folding optimization, as the value of `p` can be determined at compile-time. The value of `v` is never changed, so it is equivalent to `0`. The loop in `fn12` is also optimized away, as it is not used.\n\nIn addition, the function `fn3` and `fn6` are not used, so they can also be optimized away.
