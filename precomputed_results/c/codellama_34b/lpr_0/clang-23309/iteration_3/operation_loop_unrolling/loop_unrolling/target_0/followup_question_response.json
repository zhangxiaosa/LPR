The loop was unrolled by copying the loop body 3 times, each time with a different value of `w`. This eliminates the need for the loop and the need to evaluate the condition `w` at each iteration.\n\nThe optimized program is functionally equivalent to the original program, but it should run faster because it avoids the overhead of the loop and the condition evaluation.",

Instead of having a loop that iterates 3 times, the optimized program has the loop body duplicated 3 times, each with the appropriate values of `w` and `an` substituted. This eliminates the need for the loop and the variable `w`, resulting in a simpler and more efficient program.",

This reduces the number of instructions executed and improves the performance of the program.\n\nAlso, we have removed the `w--` statement, as it is not used anywhere in the program and serves no purpose.\n\nFinally, we have moved the `short ao = 48873;` statement outside of the if statement, as it is not dependent on the value of `w` and can be initialized once before the if statement.\n\nOverall, this optimized program is simpler, faster, and uses less memory than the original program.",

This is done by assigning the value of `w` to `an` and checking the condition `p2 || (an = w)` directly, instead of looping over it.\n\nPlease note that this optimization may change the behavior of the program, as the loop is now executed only once, whereas before it was executed `w` times. However, this optimization is often useful when the loop has a small number of iterations and the loop body is simple, as it can reduce the execution time of the program.",
