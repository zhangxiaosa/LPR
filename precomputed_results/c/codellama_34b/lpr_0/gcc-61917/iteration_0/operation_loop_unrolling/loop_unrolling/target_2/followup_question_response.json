This can potentially improve performance by reducing the number of loop iterations and the amount of work done in the loop body. However, it is important to note that loop unrolling can also increase code size and may not always lead to better performance.",

This can improve performance by reducing the number of iterations of the inner loop and allowing the compiler to better optimize the code.\n\nNote that the loop has been modified to iterate over the range [0, 20) instead of [0, 100) to avoid overflow issues. The loop also uses the modulus operator (%) to compute the remainder of the division instead of using the bitwise AND operator (&) to perform the masking.",
