The function `g` is still used to initialize the value of `o`, but now the value is stored in the variable `oe` rather than being accessed through the structure field `ad.o`.\n\nThe program's performance should be improved because the structure field accesses have been removed, and the variables are now accessed directly. However, this optimization may not have a significant impact on the program's performance, as the structure field accesses are likely to be optimized by the compiler anyway.",
