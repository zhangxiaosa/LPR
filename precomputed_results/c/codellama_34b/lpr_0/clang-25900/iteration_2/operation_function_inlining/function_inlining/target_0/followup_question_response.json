This eliminates the function call overhead and allows the compiler to further optimize the code.\n\nThe optimization has also eliminated the `p1` parameter from the `g` function, as it was not used in the function's implementation.\n\nAdditionally, the `int32_t ae` variable has been eliminated, as it was only used to store the return value of the `g` function, which is now directly assigned to `ad.o`.\n\nOverall, this optimization has simplified the code and reduced the number of instructions, which can lead to better performance and lower memory usage.",
