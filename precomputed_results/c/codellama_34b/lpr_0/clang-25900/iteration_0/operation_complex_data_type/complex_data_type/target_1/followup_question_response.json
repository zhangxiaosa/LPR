The function `g` returns an integer, which is then assigned to the `o` field of the `struct m` variable `ad`.

We have also changed the type of `s` to `int` to match the type of `ae`, which is an `int`.\n\nNext, we need to modify the `g` function to take an `int` parameter instead of an `unsigned` parameter. We can do this by changing the function signature to `g(int p1, int p2)`.\n\nFinally, we need to modify the `main` function to pass an `int` value to the `g` function instead of an `unsigned` value.
