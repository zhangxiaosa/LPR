Since `v` is an unsigned integer, we can replace the call with `g(1957, 5)`.\n\nNext, we can propagate the constant value of `ae` into the assignment `ad.o = ae`. Since `ae` is an integer, we can replace the assignment with `ad.o = 1957`.\n\nFinally, we can propagate the constant value of `t` into the expression `t % (~s / ae)`. Since `t` is an unsigned integer, we can replace the expression with `1957 % (~5L / 1957)`. This expression can be simplified to `1957 % 3`.\n\nThe optimized program is:\n```\nint main() {\n  struct m ad = {1957};\n  ad.o = 1957;\n  r = 1957 % 3;\n  ad.o;\n}\n```\nThe optimized program is shorter and simpler, and it eliminates the unnecessary function call and variable assignments.",

Constant Propagation:\nThe variable `s` is assigned a constant value of -5L, which is a constant expression. Therefore, the expression `~s` can be evaluated at compile-time and the result can be propagated throughout the program.\n\nOptimized program:\n```\nint r;\nstatic int s = -5L;\nunsigned t;\nint u;\nunsigned v;\n\nint main() {\n  struct m ad = {1957};\n  ad.o = g(v, 5);\n  int ae = ad.o;\n  ad.o = u;\n  r = t % (~s / ae);\n  ad.o;\n}\n```\n2. Copy Propagation:\nThe variable `ae` is assigned the value of `ad.o`, which is a copy of `u`.

However, `ad.o` is never used anywhere else in the program, and its value is determined by the function `g`, which always returns `p2`. Therefore, we can simplify the program by removing the unnecessary assignment to `ad.o` and replacing it with the value of `p2` directly.\n\nHere is the optimized program:\n```\nunsigned g(unsigned p1, int p2) { return p2; }\nstruct m {\n  signed n : 18;\n  signed o : 1;\n};\nint r;\nstatic int s = -5L;\nunsigned t;\nint u;\nunsigned v;\nint main() {\n  struct m ad = {1957};\n  int ae = g(v, 5);\n  r = t % (~s / ae);\n  ad.o;\n}\n```\nIn this optimized program, we have removed the assignment to `ad.o` and replaced it with the value of `p2` directly.

Constant propagation: The function `g` takes two arguments, `p1` and `p2`, but only `p2` is used in the return statement. Therefore, we can propagate the constant value of `p2` (5) into the function call and replace it with a constant value.\n2. Copy propagation: The variable `ae` is assigned the value of `ad.o`, which is itself a copy of `g(v, 5)`. We can propagate the value of `g(v, 5)` directly into the assignment to `ae`, rather than assigning `ad.o` to `ae` and then using `ae` in the calculation of `r`.\n\nWith these optimizations in mind, here's the optimized program:\n```\nunsigned g(unsigned p1, int p2) { return p2; }\nstruct m {\n  signed n : 18;\n  signed o : 1;\n};\nint r;\nstatic int s = -5L;\nunsigned t;\nint u;\nunsigned v;\nint main() {\n  struct m ad = {1957};\n  ad.o = g(v, 5);\n  int ae = ad.o;\n  ad.o = u;\n  r = t % (~s / ae);\n  ad.o;\n}\n```\nThe optimized program is shorter and more efficient, as it eliminates the unnecessary function call and variable assignments.",
