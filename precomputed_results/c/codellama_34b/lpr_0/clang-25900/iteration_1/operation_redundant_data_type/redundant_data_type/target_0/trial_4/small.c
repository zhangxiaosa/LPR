The program you provided has several issues:

1. The function `g` is not defined, so the program will not compile.
2. The variable `t` is not initialized, so its value is undefined.
3. The variable `s` is initialized to `-5L`, which is a long integer. However, the variable `r` is declared as an `int`, so the assignment `r = t % (~s / ae)` will not work because `t` is an `unsigned int` and `s` is a `long int`.
4. The variable `ad.o` is assigned the value of `5` twice, which is not necessary.
5. The variable `ae` is not used anywhere in the program.

Here is a modified version of the program that compiles and runs correctly:
