This has eliminated the need for a separate function call and has improved the performance of the program.\n\nThe `g(int p1, int p2)` function was only called once in the original program, so inlining it has had no significant impact on the overall size or complexity of the program. However, in cases where a function is called multiple times, inlining can significantly improve performance by reducing the overhead of function calls.\n\nIt is worth noting that some compilers and code analysis tools may be able to automatically inline functions like `g(int p1, int p2)` without the need for manual intervention. This can help to further improve the performance of the program.",

This eliminates the overhead of a function call and can improve performance, especially for small functions like `g`.\n\nThe optimized program is the same as the original program except for the inline expansion of the `g` function. The function `g` is no longer defined as a separate entity and is instead integrated directly into the `main` function. The resulting code is more compact and efficient, but may be more difficult to read and maintain.\n\nIt's important to note that function inlining can have both benefits and drawbacks. While it can improve performance by reducing the overhead of function calls, it can also make the code more difficult to understand and maintain. It's important to carefully consider the trade-offs before deciding to inline a function.",
