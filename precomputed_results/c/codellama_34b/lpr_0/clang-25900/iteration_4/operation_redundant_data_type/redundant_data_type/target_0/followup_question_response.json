The `struct` keyword is used to define the `m` struct, and the `g` function is defined to return the second parameter. The `main` function creates an instance of the `m` struct and assigns values to its members. It then calls the `g` function to calculate the value of `ae` and assigns it to the `o` member of the `m` struct. The `o` member is also assigned the value `5`. Finally, the `r` variable is assigned the result of the expression `t % (17 / ae)`.",

This is because the function `g` only returns the second parameter, and we know that the second parameter is always `5` in this case.\n\nWe also eliminated the variable `ae` and replaced it with the literal value `5`, as it was only used once and its value was known at compile-time.\n\nFinally, we eliminated the redundant assignment to `ad.o` and replaced it with the literal value `5`, as it was only used once and its value was known at compile-time.",
