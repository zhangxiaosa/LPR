The function call `g(p1, p2)` can be replaced with a constant value of 5.\n4. The value of `ae` is always 5, so it can be replaced with a constant value of 5.\n5. The value of `r` is always 0, so it can be optimized out.\n6. The value of `ad.o` is always 5, so it can be replaced with a constant value of 5.\n7.
