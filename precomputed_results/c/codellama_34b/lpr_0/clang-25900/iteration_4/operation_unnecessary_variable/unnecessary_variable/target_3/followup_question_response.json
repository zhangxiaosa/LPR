Constant propagation: The value of `p2` is known at compile-time, so we can replace all occurrences of `p2` with its value, which is `5`.\n2. Copy propagation: The variable `ae` is assigned the value of `ad.o`, but `ad.o` is never modified, so we can replace all occurrences of `ae` with `ad.o`.\n3. Dead code elimination: The variable `p2` is not used anywhere in the program, so we can eliminate its declaration and initialization.\n\nThe optimized program is smaller and more efficient, as it avoids unnecessary computations and memory accesses.",
