To optimize this, we can use the `uint32_t` data type instead of `unsigned r[5]`. This is because `uint32_t` is a 32-bit unsigned integer type, which can store values ranging from 0 to 4294967295, and it is more efficient to use this type instead of an array of 5 `unsigned` values.\n\nHere is the optimized program:\n```\n#include <stdint.h>\n\nuint32_t g;\nuint32_t h2 = 0x92A1D2CD;\nuint32_t fn2() {\n  for (;;) {\n    uint32_t r = 0;\n    if (h2)\n      return 0xC3;\n    g = r;\n  }\n}\n\nint main() { fn2(); }\n```\nIn this optimized program, we have replaced `unsigned r[5]` with `uint32_t r`.

The `unsigned` keyword is used to specify that the variable is unsigned, but it cannot be used as a data type on its own.\n\nTo fix this, we can change the data type of `r` to `uint32_t`, which is a typedef for an unsigned 32-bit integer. This is the same data type as `g` and `h2`, so it is a good choice for this array.\n\nHere is the modified program with the optimization applied:\n```\n#include <stdint.h>\n\nuint32_t g;\nuint32_t h2 = 0x92A1D2CD;\nuint32_t fn2() {\n  for (;;) {\n    uint32_t r[5];\n    if (h2)\n      return 0xC3;\n    g = r[0x06D7];\n  }\n}\n\nint main() { fn2(); }\n```",
