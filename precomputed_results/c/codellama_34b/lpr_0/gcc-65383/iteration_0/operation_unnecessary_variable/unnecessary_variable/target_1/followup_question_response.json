        "content": "  The program can be optimized by using constant propagation to eliminate the variable `h2`. The value of `h2` is never changed, and it is only used in the `if` statement. Since the value of `h2` is always the same, we can replace it with the constant value `0x92A1D2CDL`.\n\nHere is the optimized program:\n```\ntypedef unsigned d;\nd g;\nunsigned i = 0x06D7L;\nunsigned fn2() {\n  for (;;) {\n    unsigned q = 0xC3L;\n    unsigned r[5];\n    if (0x92A1D2CDL)\n      return q;\n    g = r[i];\n  }\n}\nint main() { fn2(); }\n```\nIn this optimized program, the variable `h2` is no longer used, and it has been eliminated from the program.
