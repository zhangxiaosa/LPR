The `fn1` function no longer takes any arguments, and its body has been inserted directly into the `fn2` function's body. The `p5` argument has been replaced with a pointer to the `struct h` object, and the `goto` statement has been replaced with a direct jump to the label `w`.",

This means that the code for `fn1` is now directly within the body of `fn2`. The `goto` statement has been eliminated, and the `for` loop in `fn1` has been moved to the end of the function. The `struct h` variable `r` has been removed, as it was only used within the `for` loop and is no longer needed.\n\nNote that the optimization has not changed the behavior of the program, but it has made it more efficient by eliminating the need for a function call and a `goto` statement.",
