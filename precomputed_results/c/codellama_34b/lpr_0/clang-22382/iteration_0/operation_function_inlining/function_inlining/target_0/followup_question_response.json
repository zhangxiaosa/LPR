This means that the code for `fn1` is now included directly in the body of `fn2`, instead of being called as a separate function.\n\nThe optimization has removed the need for the `fn1` function to be called with arguments, as the code for `fn1` is now included in the body of `fn2`. This can improve the performance of the program by reducing the overhead of function calls.\n\nNote that inlining a function can have both benefits and drawbacks. Inlining can improve performance by reducing the overhead of function calls, but it can also increase the size of the code and make it harder to understand and maintain. It is important to consider the trade-offs when deciding whether to inline a function.",
