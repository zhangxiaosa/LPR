The original program had a loop that used `p3` as a counter, but the value of `p3` was never actually used in the loop body. Instead, the loop body only used the value of `p3` to compute the expression `fn1(p3, i) && 1L`, which is then used to update the value of `j`.\n\nIn the optimized program, the variable `p3` is eliminated by copy propagation, and the loop is rewritten to use the value of `i` directly, like this:\n```\nint fn1(char p1, char p2) { return p1 * p2; }\nint i;\nint j;\nint *fn2(int *p2, char p3) {\n  for (i = 6; i != -7; i--)\n    j ^= fn1(i, i) && 1L;\n  return p2;\n}\nint main() { return 0; }\n```\nThis optimized program has the same behavior as the original program, but it has fewer instructions and is more efficient.",
