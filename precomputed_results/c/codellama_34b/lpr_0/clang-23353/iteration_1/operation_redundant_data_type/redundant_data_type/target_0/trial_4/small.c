The program you provided contains a few issues that need to be addressed before it can be optimized for the target of `char`.

Firstly, the function `fn1` takes two `char` parameters, but it returns a `char *` instead of a `char`. This is not allowed in C, as a `char *` is a pointer to a `char`, not a `char` itself. To fix this, we can change the return type of `fn1` to `char`.

Secondly, the function `fn2` takes three parameters, but it only uses two of them. The parameter `p1` is unused, and the parameter `p3` is only used within the loop. To fix this, we can remove the unused parameters and simplify the function signature.

Finally, the loop in `fn2` uses the variable `p3` as a loop counter, but it is declared as a `char`, which can only hold values from -128 to 127. This means that the loop will never execute more than 127 times, which is likely not the intended behavior. To fix this, we can change the type of `p3` to `int`, which can hold values from -2147483648 to 2147483647 and will allow the loop to execute more than 127 times.

Here is the optimized program:
