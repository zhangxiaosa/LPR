This makes the program easier to read and understand, and reduces the complexity of the code. Additionally, the `fn1` function has been modified to take `int` arguments instead of `char` arguments, which makes the function more flexible and easier to use. Finally, the `fn2` function has been modified to take `int` arguments instead of `unsigned int` and `char` arguments, which makes the function more efficient and easier to use.",
