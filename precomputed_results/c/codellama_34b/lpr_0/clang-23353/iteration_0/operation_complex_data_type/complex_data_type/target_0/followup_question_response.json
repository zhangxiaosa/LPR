So, we can decompose the `struct g` type into its individual components as follows:\n```\nstruct g {\n  int h;\n};\n```\nThe `int *` type is a pointer to an `int` variable. It can be decomposed into its individual components as follows:\n```\nint *p2;\n```\nNow, we can rewrite the program using only primary data types:\n```\nint fn1(int p1, int p2) {\n  return p1 * p2;\n}\n\nint main() {\n  int i;\n  int j;\n  int *p2;\n\n  for (i = 6; i != -7; i--)\n    j ^= fn1(i, i) && 1L;\n\n  return 0;\n}\n```\nIt's important to note that the optimization of the program depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the problem.

Array `p2`: This array has two elements, each of which is an integer.\n\nTo decompose these complex data types, we can extract the variables and replace them with variables of primary data types.

This allows the program to be optimized more effectively for the `j` variable.\n\nNote that the `j` variable is still a complex data type, but it is now composed of variables with primary data types, which can be optimized more effectively. The `j` variable is still used in the program, but it is now more optimized for performance.",
