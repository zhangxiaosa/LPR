This was done by replacing all instances of `long` with `int` in the program.\n\nThe optimized program is functionally equivalent to the original program, but it uses fewer bytes to store the data. The `long` data type takes 8 bytes to store, while the `int` data type takes 4 bytes to store. By substituting `long` with `int`, the program can store the data in fewer bytes, which can lead to faster execution and lower memory usage.",
