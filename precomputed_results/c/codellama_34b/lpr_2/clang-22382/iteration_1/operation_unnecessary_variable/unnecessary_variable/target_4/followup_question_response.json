The variable `p4` is unused in `fn1`, so it can be optimized out.\n2. The variable `p5` is passed by value to `fn1`, so it can be optimized out as well.\n3. The `goto` statement is not necessary, since the loop in `fn1` is infinite, and the `goto` statement is never reached.\n4. The variable `r` is not used in the loop, so it can be optimized out.\n\nThe optimized code for `fn2` would be:\n```\nint fn2(p1) {\n  struct h p;\n  fn1(p1, 3, p);\n}\n```\nExplanation:\n\n1. The variable `p` is not used in `fn2`, so it can be optimized out.\n2.
