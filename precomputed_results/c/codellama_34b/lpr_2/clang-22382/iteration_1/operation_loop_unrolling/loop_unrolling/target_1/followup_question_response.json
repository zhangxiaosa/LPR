The loop unrolling technique has been applied to the `while` loop in the `fn2` function, which iterates indefinitely. The loop has been unrolled to a fixed number of iterations, which is determined by the number of times the loop body executes. In this case, the loop body executes once, so the loop has been unrolled to a single iteration.\n\nThe optimized program is wrapped in a pair of `<` and `>` symbols, which indicate the beginning and end of the program, respectively.",

This was done by replacing the loop with a series of 5 identical statements, each of which calls `fn1` with a different value of `i`. The `printf` statement was also unrolled, so that it only prints the value of `i` once for each iteration of the loop.\n\nNote that this optimization is only possible because the loop in `fn2` is a simple infinite loop that does not depend on any external variables. If the loop had any dependencies or side effects, it would not be safe to unroll it in this way.",
