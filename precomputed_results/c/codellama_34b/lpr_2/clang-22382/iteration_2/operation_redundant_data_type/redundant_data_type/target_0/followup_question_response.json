The `int` data type is defined three times in the program, once in the global scope, once in the scope of `fn1`, and once in the scope of `fn2`. To eliminate the duplicate definition, we can use the `typedef` keyword to create an alias for the `int16_t` data type and use it instead of `int` in the program. This way, we can reduce the amount of code and make the program more efficient.",
