The target to be optimized is \"int e\": This is also a built-in data type in C that represents a 32-bit integer.\n\nThe given program is a recursive function that takes no arguments and has a return type of int. The function is defined as fn1 and it calls itself recursively until a certain condition is met. The condition is based on the value of the variable e, which is also defined in the program.\n\nTo optimize the program, we can eliminate the variable e and substitute it with its associated original data type, which is int.
