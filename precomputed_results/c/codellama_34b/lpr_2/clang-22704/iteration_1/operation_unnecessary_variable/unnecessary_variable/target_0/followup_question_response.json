Constant propagation:\nThe variable `d` is assigned the same value `0xEEACFBBFL` in both branches of the if-statement. Since this value is constant, we can propagate it and remove the assignment to `d`.\n2. Copy propagation:\nThe value of `d` is not used anywhere in the program, so we can remove the assignment to `d` and replace all occurrences of `d` with `0xEEACFBBFL`.\n\nThe optimized program is smaller and more efficient, as it no longer includes the unnecessary assignment to `d`.",

This is because the value of `d` is always the same, and it can be propagated throughout the program. Additionally, the variable `e` is also unused, and the value `0xEEACFBBFL` is directly returned by the function `fn1` if `e` is true.\n\nBy optimizing the program using constant propagation and copy propagation, the resulting program is simpler and more efficient, as it eliminates unnecessary variables and instructions.",

Therefore, it can be optimized out by constant propagation or copy propagation.\n\nBy applying constant propagation, we can see that the value of `d` is always `0xEEACFBBFL` in both the `if` and `else` branches of the `fn1()` function. Therefore, we can propagate this value to the `d` variable and eliminate the assignment to it.

Therefore, we can eliminate the assignment to `d` and use the value of `0xEEACFBBFL` directly. The optimized program is:\n```\nint e;\nint fn1() {\n  if (e)\n    goto i;\n  fn1();\n  return 0xEEACFBBFL;\ni:\n  return 0xEEACFBBFL;\n}\nint main() {}\n```\nIn both cases, the variable `d` is no longer used in the optimized program, as it is not referenced or used later in the program.",

Therefore, the statement `d = 0xEEACFBBFL` has been removed from the program.\n\nThe program has also been simplified by removing the `goto` statement in `fn1()`, as it is no longer necessary. The `if` condition is now evaluated directly in the `fn1()` function, and the recursive call to `fn1()` is made unconditionally.\n\nThe `main()` function has also been simplified by removing the call to `fn1()`, as it is no longer necessary.
