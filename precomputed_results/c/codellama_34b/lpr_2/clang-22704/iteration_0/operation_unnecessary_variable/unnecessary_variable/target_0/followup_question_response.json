Constant propagation is the process of evaluating constant expressions at compile-time and replacing them with their values. In this case, the expression `0xEEACFBBFL` is a constant expression that can be evaluated at compile-time, so it was replaced with its value `449`.\n\nCopy propagation is the process of replacing a variable with its definition. In this case, the variable `h` is not used anywhere in the program, so it can be replaced with its definition `449` everywhere it appears. This optimization reduces the number of variables in the program and makes it more efficient to execute.",
