The program does not contain any unnecessary or redundant code, and it is ready to be compiled and executed.\n\nNote that the program has a potential infinite loop, as the `for` loop in `fn3` does not have a termination condition and the `l` variable is not modified within the loop. This means that the loop will continue indefinitely, potentially causing the program to crash or run indefinitely depending on the input. To avoid this, it is recommended to add a termination condition to the loop or to modify the `l` variable within the loop.",
