The optimized program simply removes the declaration and initialization of \"l\" and replaces all references to \"l\" with \"0\". This results in a smaller, more efficient program that is easier to analyze and understand.\n\nNote that this optimization technique is only applicable to variables that are not used anywhere in the program.
