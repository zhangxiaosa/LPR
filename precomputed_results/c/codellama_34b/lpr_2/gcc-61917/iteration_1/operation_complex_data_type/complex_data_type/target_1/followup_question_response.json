The original program used a pointer to an `int` as a parameter for the function `fn3`, but this has been replaced with a primary data type `int` to improve performance. The function `fn3` now takes an `int` as an argument and uses it directly instead of using a pointer to an `int`.\n\nThe optimization has been done by using the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the variable `p1` as the target to be optimized.\n2. Check the data type of `p1` and determine that it is a pointer to an `int`.\n3. Decompose the pointer `p1` into a primary data type `int` using the dereference operator `*`.\n4. Replace all occurrences of `p1` with the decomposed variable `*p1`.\n5. Remove the pointer notation `*` from the function signature and parameter list.\n\nThe optimized program now uses a primary data type `int` instead of a pointer to an `int`, which can improve performance by reducing the number of memory accesses and improving cache locality.",

The `fn3` function now takes a pointer to `x` as its argument, and the loop in `fn3` is modified to use the pointer arithmetic operator `*p1` to access the value of `x` and update it. The `main` function now initializes `x` to 0 and passes a pointer to `x` to `fn3`.\n\nThe optimization can be performed by the compiler or the runtime environment, depending on the implementation. The optimization will likely be applied to the loop in `fn3` that updates the value of `x` based on the value of `l` and `k`. The optimization may be performed by unrolling the loop, reducing the number of operations performed in each iteration, or using other techniques to improve performance.",
