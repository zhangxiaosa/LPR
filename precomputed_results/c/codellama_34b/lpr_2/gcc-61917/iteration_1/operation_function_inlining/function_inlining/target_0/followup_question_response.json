This means that the code for the `fn3` function is now part of the `main` function, and the `fn3` function is no longer a separate entity.\n\nThe optimization has been achieved by removing the function call to `fn3` in the `main` function, and instead inserting the code for the `fn3` function directly into the `main` function. This has eliminated the overhead of the function call, and has improved the performance of the program.\n\nNote that the optimization has also removed the `p1` parameter from the `main` function, as it is no longer needed. The `p1` variable is now defined within the `main` function, and is used directly in the code that was previously in the `fn3` function.",

This means that the body of `fn3` has been copied and pasted into the `main` function, and any calls to `fn3` have been replaced with the inlined code.\n\nThe optimization has been performed by using the `inline` keyword in the function declaration, which tells the compiler to inline the function when it is called. The `inline` keyword is followed by the name of the function to be inlined, and the function body is enclosed in curly braces.\n\nThe resulting program is smaller and more efficient, as the function call overhead is eliminated and the code is executed directly in the `main` function. However, it is important to note that function inlining may not always be possible or desirable, as it can lead to increased code size and complexity in some cases.",
