Then, it initializes a vector `f` of type `d` with the value of `c` and returns it.\n\nIn the optimized version, we have inlined the call to `fn1` and directly initialized the vector `f` with the result of `fn1`. This eliminates the need for the temporary variable `c` and reduces the number of instructions in the program.",

This has eliminated the overhead of the function call, which was the main performance bottleneck in the original program.\n\nTo enable function inlining, the `FN2_INLINE` macro has been defined in the code. When this macro is defined, the `fn2` function is defined as an inline function, which means that the function body is inserted directly into the code where the function is called. This eliminates the need for a function call and allows the compiler to perform additional optimizations.\n\nWhen the `FN2_INLINE` macro is not defined, the `fn2` function is defined as a regular function, and the function call to `fn1` is preserved. This allows the program to be compiled without inlining, which can be useful for debugging or when the performance benefits of inlining are not necessary.",
