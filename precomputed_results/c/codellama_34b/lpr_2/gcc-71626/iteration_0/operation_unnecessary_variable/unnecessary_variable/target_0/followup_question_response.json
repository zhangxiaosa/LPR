In the original program, the variable `c` is assigned the value of `fn1`, which is a function pointer. However, `c` is never used in the program, so it can be removed.\n2. Since `c` is not used, the expression `d f = {c}` can be simplified to `d f = {fn1}`, since `fn1` is a constant expression that can be evaluated at compile-time.\n3.
