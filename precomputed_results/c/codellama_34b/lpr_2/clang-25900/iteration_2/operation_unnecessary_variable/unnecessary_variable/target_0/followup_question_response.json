Constant propagation: The value of `s` is constant and can be propagated throughout the program. Therefore, we can simplify the expression `~s / ae` to `~(-5L) / ae` which is equivalent to `-1 / ae`.\n2. Copy propagation: The variable `ad` is not used anywhere in the program, so we can eliminate it and replace all references to it with the value of `p1`.\n\nThe optimized program is smaller and more efficient, as it eliminates the unnecessary variable `ad` and performs constant propagation and copy propagation.",
