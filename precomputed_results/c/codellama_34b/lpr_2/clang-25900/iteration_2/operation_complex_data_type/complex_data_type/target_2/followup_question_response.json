The `p1` parameter has been replaced with the `o` variable. The `ad` variable has been removed, and the `ae` variable has been declared as a separate variable. The `r` variable has been declared as a global variable. The `s` variable has been declared as a static int with the value -5L.

We have also removed the struct `m` and the function `fn4_inlined` definition, as they are not needed in the optimized version.

The `struct m` and the `o` field are no longer used, as they were unnecessary for the program's functionality. The `ae` variable is now used to store the value of `p1`, which is used in the calculation of `r`. The `s` variable is still used, but it is now assigned the value of `-5L` instead of being initialized to zero.\n\nThe program's behavior is now equivalent to the following:\n```\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n  int p1 = 5;\n  r = p1 % (~-5L / p1);\n  return 0;\n}\n```\nThe optimized program has a much simpler structure and fewer variables, making it easier to understand and maintain. It also eliminates the unnecessary use of a struct and a field, which can improve the program's performance.",
