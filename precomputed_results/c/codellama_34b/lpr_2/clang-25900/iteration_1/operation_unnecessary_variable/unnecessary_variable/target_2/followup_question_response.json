The variable `af` is initialized with the value of `u`, which is a global variable that is not modified in the program. Therefore, we can propagate this value and replace all occurrences of `af` with `u`.\n3. The variable `r` is assigned the value of `af % (~s / ae)`, which is a constant expression. Therefore, we can evaluate this expression at compile-time and replace all occurrences of `r` with the result of the expression.\n\nThe optimized program does not contain any unused variables or redundant calculations, and the resulting assembly code will be more efficient and faster to execute.",

Constant propagation: The value of `s` is constant and can be propagated to the line where it is used. The expression `~s` can be evaluated at compile-time and the result is propagated to the line where it is used.\n2. Copy propagation: The variable `ae` is only used once, and its value is the same as `ad.o`. Therefore, `ae` can be removed and `ad.o` can be used directly.\n\nNote: The resulting program is not necessarily more efficient than the original program. The optimizations performed by constant propagation and copy propagation can sometimes make the program larger or slower. It is important to profile and test the optimized program to ensure that it performs as expected.",

The expression `~s / ae` is a constant expression, and the value of `ae` is a constant 1957. Therefore, we can calculate the value of `~s / ae` at compile-time and replace it with the resulting constant value.\n\nAfter constant propagation, the program becomes:\n```\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nstruct m {\n  int n : 18;\n  int o : 1;\n};\n\nint r;\nstatic int s = -5L;\nint u;\n\nint fn4_inlined(p1) {\n  struct m ad = {1957};\n  ad.o = p1;\n  int ae = 1957;\n  int af = u;\n  ae = ad.o;\n  ad.o = u;\n  r = af % (~s / ae);\n  return ad.o;\n}\n\nint main() { fn4_inlined(5); }\n```\nNext, let's perform copy propagation. The variable `ae` is assigned the value `ad.o`, which is also the value of `p1`. Therefore, we can replace all occurrences of `ae` with `p1`.\n\nAfter copy propagation, the program becomes:\n```\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nstruct m {\n  int n : 18;\n  int o : 1;\n};\n\nint r;\nstatic int s = -5L;\nint u;\n\nint fn4_inlined(p1) {\n  struct m ad = {1957};\n  ad.o = p1;\n  int af = u;\n  ad.o = u;\n  r = af % (~s / p1);\n  return ad.o;\n}\n\nint main() { fn4_inlined(5); }\n```\nFinally, we can optimize out the variable `ae` by removing its declaration and all occurrences of it.\n\nThe optimized program is:\n```\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nstruct m {\n  int n : 18;\n  int o : 1;\n};\n\nint r;\nstatic int s = -5L;\nint u;\n\nint fn4_inlined(p1) {\n  struct m ad = {1957};\n  ad.o = p1;\n  int af = u;\n  ad.o = u;\n  r = af % (~s / p1);\n  return ad.o;\n}\n\nint main() { fn4_inlined(5); }\n```\nNote that the optimized program is functionally equivalent to the original program, but it is smaller and more efficient.",
