The `struct` data type has been replaced with separate variables `n` and `o` of type `int`, which are initialized with the values `1957` and `5`, respectively. The `fn4_inlined` function has also been inlined into the `main` function to reduce the overhead of function calls.\n\nThe optimized program is now:\n```\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n  int n = 1957;\n  int o = 5;\n  int ae;\n  int af = u;\n  ae = o;\n  o = u;\n  r = af % (~s / ae);\n  return o;\n}\n```\nNote that the optimization has eliminated the `struct` data type and replaced it with individual variables, which can improve the performance of the program. However, it is important to note that this optimization may also change the behavior of the program, as the `struct` data type may have provided additional structure and organization to the data. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the trade-offs between performance and functionality when applying optimizations like this.",

The `struct` members `n` and `o` have been inlined as `ad` and `ae` respectively. The `static int s` has been inlined as `5L`.\n\nThe `fn4_inlined` function has also been optimized by removing the structure passing and using plain `int` variables instead. The `struct m` parameter has been replaced with `p1`, which is passed by value. The function now uses `ad` and `ae` instead of `ad.n` and `ad.o`.\n\nThe `main` function has been optimized by removing the `struct m` and using plain `int` variables instead.
