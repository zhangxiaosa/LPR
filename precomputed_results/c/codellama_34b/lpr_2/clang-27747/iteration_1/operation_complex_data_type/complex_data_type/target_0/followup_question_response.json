However, only the `g` member is used in the program. Therefore, we can simplify the program by removing the `struct c` type and only using the `int` type for the `g` member.\n* `j`: This variable is also of type `struct c`, but only the `e` member is used in the program. Therefore, we can simplify the program by removing the `struct c` type and only using the `int` type for the `e` member.\n* `l`: This variable is of type `struct c`, but only the `d` and `g` members are used in the program. Therefore, we can simplify the program by removing the `struct c` type and only using the `int` type for the `d` and `g` members.\n* `m`: This variable is of type `int`, but it is only used to initialize the `d` member of the `l` variable. Therefore, we can simplify the program by removing the `m` variable and directly assigning the value to the `d` member of the `l` variable.\n\nHere is the optimized program:\n```\nint i, j, l, m;\n\ni = 0;\nj = 6738;\nl = 24;\nm = j;\nl = m;\nn = j && l;\np = l | -(l && l) - n;\ni = p;\n```\nIn this optimized program, we have removed the `struct c` type and only used the `int` type for all the variables. We have also removed the unnecessary `struct c` variables and only used the `int` variables for the `d` and `g` members. Finally, we have directly assigned the value to the `d` member of the `l` variable instead of using the `m` variable.",
