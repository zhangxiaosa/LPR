This is achieved through constant propagation and copy propagation, which are two common optimizations performed by compilers to reduce the size and improve the performance of the generated code.\n\nConstant propagation involves replacing a constant value with its literal value in the code. In this case, the `int h` field is never assigned a value, so it can be safely removed from the `struct c` definition.\n\nCopy propagation involves propagating the value of a variable to all the places where it is used, eliminating the need for temporary variables. In this case, the `struct c` instance `j` is never modified, so the value of its `h` field can be propagated to the `int n` variable, eliminating the need for the `int n = j.h && l.d;` statement.\n\nAfter these optimizations, the program becomes smaller and more efficient, with a reduced number of variables and statements.",
