This is because `g` is not used anywhere in the program, so it can be safely removed.\n\nAdditionally, we have optimized out the computation of `p` by constant propagation. Since `l.g` is always equal to `l.d` in the given program, we can simplify the expression `l.g && l.d` to simply `l.d`. This allows us to simplify the expression for `p` to `l.d | -(l.d) - n`, which is equivalent to `l.d | -n`.\n\nOverall, this optimization has simplified the program and reduced the number of variables being used, making it more efficient and easier to read.",
