Note that the optimized program uses a loop unrolling technique to optimize the loop. The loop is unrolled by a factor of 2, which means that the loop body is executed twice for each iteration of the loop. This can improve the performance of the program by reducing the number of iterations needed to complete the loop.

To measure the performance of the optimized program, you can use a profiling tool such as gprof or valgrind. These tools can provide you with information about the execution time and memory usage of the program, which can help you determine the effectiveness of the optimization.
