Since `m` is not modified, we can replace `m` with `l.d` in the expression.\n3. Dead code elimination: The expression `l.g && l.d` is not used anywhere in the program, so it can be removed.\n4. Unused variable elimination: The variable `n` is not used anywhere in the program, so it can be removed.\n5.
