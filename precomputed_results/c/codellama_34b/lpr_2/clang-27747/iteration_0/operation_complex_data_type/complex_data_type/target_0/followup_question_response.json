The variables `d1`, `e1`, `f1`, `d2`, `h1`, and `g1` are all of type `int`, which is the primary data type used in the original program.

Here is the optimized program:\n```\n#include <stdint.h>\n\nint16_t d = 24;\nuint16_t e = 6738;\nuint16_t f = 165;\nint16_t g = 0;\nint16_t h = 0;\n\nint main() {\n  int m = e;\n  d = m;\n  int n = h && d;\n  int o = d;\n  int p = o | -(f && d) - n;\n  g = p;\n}\n```\nIn this optimized program, we have removed the structure `j` and instead defined its individual members as separate variables.

To decompose the program into variables with primary data types, we can start by breaking down the `struct c` type into its individual fields:\n```\nstruct c {\n    signed int d;\n    unsigned int e;\n    unsigned int f;\n};\n```\nWe can then decompose the `struct c` type into its individual fields, and use these fields to create new variables with primary data types. For example, we can create the following new variables:\n```\nint d = j.d;\nunsigned int e = j.e;\nunsigned int f = j.f;\n```\nWe can then use these new variables to perform the operations in the program. For example, we can replace `j.d` with `d`, `j.e` with `e`, and `j.f` with `f` in the program.\n\nHere is the decomposed program:\n```\nint main() {\n    int d = j.d;\n    unsigned int e = j.e;\n    unsigned int f = j.f;\n\n    int m = j.e;\n    d = m;\n    int n = j.h && d;\n    int o = d;\n    int p = o | -(f && d) - n;\n    i.g = p;\n}\n```\nNote that in the decomposed program, we have replaced the `struct c` type with individual variables of primary data types.
