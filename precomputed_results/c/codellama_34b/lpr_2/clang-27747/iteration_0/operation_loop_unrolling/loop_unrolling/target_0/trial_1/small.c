Given the following program and the first line of a loop, optimize it out via loop unrolling.. The program is typedef signed a;
typedef int b;
struct c {
  signed d : 18;
  unsigned e;
  unsigned f;
  signed g;
  signed h;
};
struct c i;
struct c j;
int main() {
  struct c l = {24, 6738, 165};
  b m = j.e;
  l.d = m;
  b n = j.h && l.d;
  b o = l.d;
  a p = o | -(l.f && l.d) - n;
  i.g = p;
}

The target to be optimized is do {.

Optimized Program:

typedef signed a;
typedef int b;
struct c {
  signed d : 18;
  unsigned e;
  unsigned f;
  signed g;
  signed h;
};
struct c i;
struct c j;
int main() {
  struct c l = {24, 6738, 165};
  b m = j.e;
  l.d = m;
  b n = j.h && l.d;
  b o = l.d;
  a p = o | -(l.f && l.d) - n;
  i.g = p;
}

Explanation:

The given program is already optimized and there is no further optimization possible. The program defines a few types and structures, and then initializes some variables. The main function is simple and does not contain any loops, so there is no opportunity for loop unrolling.
