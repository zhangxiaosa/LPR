However, if we want to further optimize the program, we can use loop unrolling to remove the loop and make the program faster.\n\nHere is the optimized program:\n```\nstruct c i;\nstruct c j;\nint main() {\n  i.d = j.e && j.h;\n}\n```\nIn this optimized program, we have removed the loop and directly assigned the value of `j.e && j.h` to `i.d`.

This can lead to a significant increase in performance, especially for large input sizes.\n\nTo unroll the loop, we simply duplicate the loop body and replace the loop variable `xxx` with the corresponding value from the unrolled loop. In this case, we are unrolling the loop by a factor of 2, so we replace `xxx` with `xxx` and `xxx+1` in the unrolled loop body.\n\nThe resulting optimized program has a smaller number of instructions, which can lead to faster execution. Additionally, the unrolled loop body is executed twice as many times as the original loop body, which can also lead to improved performance.",
