To eliminate the `a` type and substitute it with its associated original data type, we need to perform the following steps:

1. Identify all instances of `a` in the program and determine the data type associated with each instance.
2. Replace each instance of `a` with the associated data type.

In this case, the data type associated with `a` is `char`. Therefore, we need to replace all instances of `a` with `char`.

The resulting program would be as follows:
