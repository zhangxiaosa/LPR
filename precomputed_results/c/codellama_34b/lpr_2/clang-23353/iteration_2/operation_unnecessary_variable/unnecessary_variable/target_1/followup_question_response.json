This is because the value of `fn1(p3, i)` is always `1L` due to the constant propagation performed in the function `fn1`. Therefore, we can simplify the expression to `j.h ^= 1L`, which is equivalent to `j.h = j.h ^ 1L`.\n\nNote that the variable `p1` is unused in the optimized program, so we have removed it from the function signature and the function body.",
