Therefore, it was optimized out by constant propagation. The expression `fn1(p3, i) && 1L` was simplified to `1L` because `fn1` always returns 1.\n\nIn the optimized program, the variable `i` has been removed, and the expression `fn1(p3, i) && 1L` has been simplified to `1L`.",

This is because the value of `i` is not used in the program, so it can be safely replaced with a constant value.\n\nAlternatively, if the program is compiled with optimization flags such as `-O2` or `-O3`, the compiler will likely perform this optimization automatically.
