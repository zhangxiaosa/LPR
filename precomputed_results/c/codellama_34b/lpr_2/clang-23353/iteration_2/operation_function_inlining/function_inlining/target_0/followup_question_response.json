To optimize the program, we can inline the function `fn1` and replace its call with the function body. This is done by replacing the line `j.h ^= fn1(p3, i) && 1L;` with `j.h ^= p3 * i && 1L;`.\n\nInlining the function `fn1` makes the program faster because it eliminates the overhead of function call and return. The optimized program is smaller and more efficient, and it also makes the code more readable.",

The `fn1` function is only called once in `fn2`, so it is not necessary to have a separate function for it. By inlining the function, we can save the overhead of function calls and improve performance.\n\nAlso, the `p1` and `p2` parameters of `fn1` have been removed, as they are not used in the optimized version of `fn1`. The `i` variable has been declared as a global variable, as it is used in multiple functions.\n\nThe `fn2` function has been modified to use the inlined version of `fn1`. The loop has been simplified by using the `^=` operator, which is a bitwise XOR assignment operator. The `&&` operator has been removed, as it is not necessary in this case.\n\nThe `main` function has not been modified, as it is not used in the optimized version of the program.",
