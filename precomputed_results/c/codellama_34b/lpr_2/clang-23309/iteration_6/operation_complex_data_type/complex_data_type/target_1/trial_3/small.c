Given the following program and the variable in complex data type, decompose the it into variables with primary data type. The program is int t;
int v_int;
unsigned ac = 1;
int main() {
  short an = 0x294A;
  t = ac || (an = 0);
  short ao = 0xBCD1;
  int temp = ao - (1 - an);
  v_int = temp - t & 1;
  printf("checksum = %d\n", v_int);
  return 0;
}

The target to be optimized is ao: short.

To decompose the program into variables with primary data type, we can start by defining the following variables:

* t: int
* v_int: int
* ac: unsigned int
* an: short
* ao: short
* temp: int

The program can then be rewritten as follows:
