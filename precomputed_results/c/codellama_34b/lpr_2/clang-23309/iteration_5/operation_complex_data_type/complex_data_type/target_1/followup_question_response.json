The `ao_hi` variable represents the high 16 bits of the `ao` variable, while the `ao_lo` variable represents the low 16 bits.\n\nThe program also includes two new variables: `t` and `v_int`. The `t` variable is used to store the result of the `ac || (an = w)` expression, while the `v_int` variable is used to store the result of the `fn2` function.\n\nThe main function has been modified to use the `ao_hi` and `ao_lo` variables instead of the original `ao` variable. The `ao_hi` and `ao_lo` variables are used to compute the `temp` variable, which is then passed as an argument to the `fn2` function. The result of the `fn2` function is stored in the `v_int` variable, which is then printed to the console using the `printf` function.\n\nOverall, this program is functionally equivalent to the original program, but with the variable `ao` decomposed into two variables for improved readability and maintainability.",
