The variable `an` is assigned the value `0x294A` and is used in the expression `temp = 0xBCD1 - (1 - an)`. However, since `an` is only used once in this expression, it can be optimized out by eliminating the variable and replacing it with the constant value `0x294A`.\n\nAdditionally, I have also optimized out the variable `ao` by replacing it with the constant value `0xBCD1` in the expression `temp = ao - (1 - an)`.\n\nThe final optimized program has the same functionality as the original program, but with fewer instructions and variables.",
