Therefore, the expression `1 - an` can be simplified to `0`, and the expression `ao - (1 - an)` can be simplified to `ao`.\n\nThe copy propagation optimization is applied to the expression `t = ac || (an = w)`, which is always equal to `t = ac || 0`, since `an` is a constant `0x294A`.

Constant Propagation:\nThe variable \"ac\" is assigned the value 1, which is a constant. This value is never changed throughout the program. Therefore, we can propagate the constant value of 1 to the expression \"ac || (an = w)\".\n2. Copy Propagation:\nThe variable \"t\" is assigned the value of the expression \"ac || (an = w)\". However, the variable \"an\" is never used after its assignment, and the variable \"w\" is always 0. Therefore, we can propagate the value of \"t\" to the expression \"ao - (1 - an)\".\n3. Dead Code Elimination:\nThe variable \"an\" is never used after its assignment, and the variable \"w\" is always 0. Therefore, we can eliminate the assignment to \"an\" and the expression \"ao - (1 - an)\".\n\nWith these optimizations, the optimized program is:\n```\nint fn2(int p1, int p2) { return p1 - p2; }\nint t;\nint v_int;\nshort w;\nunsigned ac = 1;\nint main() {\n  short an;\n  w = 0;\n  t = 1;\n  short ao = 0xBCD1;\n  int temp = ao;\n  v_int = fn2(temp, t) & 1;\n  printf(\"checksum = %d\\n\", v_int);\n  return 0;\n}\n```\nIn this optimized program, the variable \"an\" is eliminated, and the expression \"ao - (1 - an)\" is simplified to \"ao\". The variable \"w\" is also eliminated, and the expression \"ac || (an = w)\" is simplified to \"1\". The variable \"t\" is assigned the constant value 1, and the expression \"fn2(temp, t)\" is simplified to \"fn2(ao, 1)\". The final value of \"v_int\" is the same as in the original program.",
