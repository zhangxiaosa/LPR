Constant propagation: The variable `ac` is initialized to 1 and is never modified, so its value can be propagated throughout the program.\n2. Copy propagation: The variable `an` is assigned the value `0x294A`, and this value is never modified. Therefore, `an` can be replaced with `0x294A` wherever it is used.\n3. Dead code elimination: The variable `w` is assigned the value 0 but is never used. Therefore, the assignment to `w` can be eliminated.\n4. Dead code elimination: The variable `ac` is never used after it is initialized. Therefore, the initialization of `ac` can be eliminated.\n5. Dead code elimination: The variable `ao` is never used after it is initialized. Therefore, the initialization of `ao` can be eliminated.\n6. Constant folding: The expression `1 - an` can be evaluated at compile-time to yield 0. Therefore, the expression can be simplified to `ao - 0`, which is equivalent to `ao`.\n7. Dead code elimination: The variable `temp` is assigned the value `ao - 0`, but is never used. Therefore, the assignment to `temp` can be eliminated.\n8. Dead code elimination: The variable `v_int` is assigned the value 1 but is never used. Therefore, the assignment to `v_int` can be eliminated.\n\nThe optimized program has the same behavior as the original program, but it is smaller and more efficient because it eliminates unnecessary variables and operations.",
