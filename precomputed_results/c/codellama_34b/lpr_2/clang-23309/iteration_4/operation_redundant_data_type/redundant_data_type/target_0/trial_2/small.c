Given the following program and the specified data type, eliminate it, and substitute every instance of it with its associated original data type. The program is int fn2(int p1, int p2) { return p1 - p2; }
int t;
int v_int;
short w;
unsigned ac = 1;
int main() {
  short an;
  w = 0;
  an = 0x294A;
  t = ac || (an = w);
  short ao = 0xBCD1;
  if (fn2(ao - (1 - an), t) & 1)
    v_int = 1;
  printf("checksum = %d\n", v_int);
  return 0;
}

The target to be optimized is `unsigned ac`.

After analysis, we can see that the variable `ac` is not used anywhere in the program except for its declaration. Therefore, we can safely remove it from the program without affecting its functionality.

Here is the optimized program:
