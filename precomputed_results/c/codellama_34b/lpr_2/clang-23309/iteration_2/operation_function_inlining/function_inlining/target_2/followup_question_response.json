The `fn2` function is called with the arguments `ao - fn4(fn6(1L, an), 0xECL)` and `t`. The result of this call is stored in a temporary variable, which is then used in the `if` statement.\n\nIn general, function inlining can help to improve the performance of a program by reducing the overhead of function calls. However, it is important to use this optimization technique judiciously, as excessive inlining can actually decrease performance in some cases.",
