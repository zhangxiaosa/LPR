This is because the `unsigned` data type is not used in any meaningful way in the program, and it is not necessary to use it in order to achieve the desired functionality.\n\nThe `unsigned` data type is typically used to represent non-negative numbers, and it is often used in situations where a larger range of values is needed than can be represented by the `int` data type. However, in this program, the `unsigned` data type is not used in any situation where it would provide any benefit over using the `int` data type. Therefore, it is not necessary to use the `unsigned` data type in this program, and it can be safely eliminated.",
