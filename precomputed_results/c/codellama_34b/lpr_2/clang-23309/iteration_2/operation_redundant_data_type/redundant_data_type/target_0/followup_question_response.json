This is done to improve the performance of the program, as the `short` data type is generally faster and more efficient than `int`.\n\nIn the optimized version of the program, the `int` data type has been replaced with `short` in the following ways:\n\n* The `fn2` function takes two `short` arguments instead of two `int` arguments.\n* The `fn4` function takes two `short` arguments instead of two `unsigned` arguments.\n* The `an` variable is declared as a `short` instead of an `int`.\n* The `ao` variable is declared as a `short` instead of an `unsigned`.\n* The `v` variable is declared as a `short` instead of an `int`.\n* The `p` variable is declared as a `short` instead of an `int`.\n* The `t` variable is declared as a `short` instead of an `int`.\n* The `w` variable is declared as a `short` instead of an `int`.\n* The `ac` variable is declared as an `unsigned short` instead of an `unsigned int`.\n\nIn addition to these changes, the program has also been modified to use the `short` data type for the `al` variable, which was previously declared as an `int`.\n\nOverall, the optimized version of the program is smaller and faster than the original version, and uses less memory due to the use of the `short` data type.",
