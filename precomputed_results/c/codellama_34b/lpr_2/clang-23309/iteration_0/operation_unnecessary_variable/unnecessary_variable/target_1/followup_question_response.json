This reduces the complexity of the expression `fn4(fn6(am, an), 0xECL)` to `fn4(fn6(1L, an), 0xECL)`.\n\nFinally, we can propagate the constant `1L` to the variable `am` in the call to `fn2(ao - fn4(fn6(am, an), 0xECL), t)`. This reduces the complexity of the expression `fn2(ao - fn4(fn6(am, an), 0xECL), t)` to `fn2(ao - fn4(fn6(1L, an), 0xECL), t)`.\n\nThe optimized code is as follows:\n```\nint fn13() {\n  int al = 3L;\n  long am = 1L;\n  short an;\n  for (w = 3; w; w -= 1) {\n    an = 250UL;\n    t = fn5(ab, ac) || (an = w) == 0x294A85636008822DLL;\n    short ao = 0xBCD1L;\n    if (fn2(ao - fn4(fn6(1L, an), 0xECL), t) & 1UL)\n      v = 1;\n  }\n  return al;\n}\n```\nIn this optimized code, the variable `am` is no longer used, so it can be removed from the program.
