To decompose the variables with complex data types into primary data types, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the variables with complex data types: In this case, we have two variables with complex data types: `p1` and `p2`.\n2. Decompose the variables into primary data types: We can decompose `p1` and `p2` into their corresponding primary data types as follows:\n\t* `p1`: `int`\n\t* `p2`: `int`\n3. Replace the complex data types with their corresponding primary data types: We can replace the complex data types with their corresponding primary data types in the program as follows:\n\t* Replace `p1` with `int`\n\t* Replace `p2` with `int`\n\nThe final program with the complex data types replaced with their corresponding primary data types is as follows:\n```\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint fn2(int p1, int p2) {\n  return p1 - p2;\n}\n\nunsigned char fn4(unsigned p1, unsigned p2) {\n  return p1;\n}\n\nint p;\nint t;\nint v_int;\nshort w;\nunsigned ac = 1;\n\nint fn13() {\n  short al = 3;\n  short an;\n  for (w = 3; w; w -= 1) {\n    an = 0x294A;\n    t = ac || (an = w) == 0x294A85636008822D;\n    short ao = 0xBCD1;\n    if (fn2(ao - fn4(1 - an, 0xECL), t) & 1)\n      v_int = 1;\n  }\n  return al;\n}\n\nint main() {\n  fn13();\n  p = v_int;\n  printf(\"checksum = %d\\n\", p);\n  return 0;\n}\n```\nThe target to be optimized in the program is `p1` and `p2` in `fn2`.",

This allows the compiler to optimize the code by removing the check for `an == 0x294A85636008822D` in the `if` statement.\n* The variable `ao` is initialized to 0xBCD1 at the beginning of the function `fn13`, and is not modified anywhere in the function. This allows the compiler to optimize the code by removing the check for `ao == 0xBCD1` in the `if` statement.\n* The variable `t` is initialized to 0 at the beginning of the function `fn13`, and is not modified anywhere in the function. This allows the compiler to optimize the code by removing the check for `t == 0` in the `if` statement.\n* The variable `v_int` is initialized to 0 at the beginning of the function `fn13`, and is not modified anywhere in the function. This allows the compiler to optimize the code by removing the check for `v_int == 1` in the `if` statement.\n* The variable `w` is initialized to 3 at the beginning of the function `fn13`, and is not modified anywhere in the function. This allows the compiler to optimize the code by removing the check for `w == 3` in the `for` loop.\n* The variable `ac` is initialized to 1 at the beginning of the function `fn13`, and is not modified anywhere in the function. This allows the compiler to optimize the code by removing the check for `ac == 1` in the `if` statement.\n\nThe optimized program is smaller and faster than the original program, because it avoids unnecessary checks and initializations.",
