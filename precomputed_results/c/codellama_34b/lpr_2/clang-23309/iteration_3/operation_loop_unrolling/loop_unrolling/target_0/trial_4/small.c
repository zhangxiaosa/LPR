The given program has a loop that is executed three times, and the loop body contains some complex instructions that are not easily optimizable. However, we can try to use loop unrolling to optimize the loop.

Loop unrolling is a technique where we duplicate the loop body and execute it multiple times in a row, reducing the number of iterations of the loop. This can be useful for loops that have a small number of iterations and where the loop body is relatively simple.

In this case, we can unroll the loop three times, since the loop is executed three times. We can create three copies of the loop body and execute them in a row, without the need for the loop control variable `w` to be updated.

Here is the optimized program with loop unrolling:
