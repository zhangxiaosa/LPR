This is done by changing the loop condition to `j < 9` and incrementing `j` by 3 each time through the loop.\n\nThe optimized program should be faster than the original program because it has fewer loop iterations.

This way, we avoid the overhead of the loop and the unnecessary computation of `g`. We also moved the loop to the `main` function, where it can be more efficiently optimized by the compiler.\n\nNote that we also removed the `for (;;)` loop from the `fn2` function, as it was not being used.
