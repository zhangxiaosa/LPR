Since it is not used, we can optimize it out by replacing it with a constant value of 0.\n\nTo do this, we first identify the assignment of the array `r_real` to the variable `g` on line 9 of the original code. We then replace this assignment with a new assignment that sets `g` to 0.\n\nFinally, we remove the declaration of the array `r_real` from the function `fn2` and the function call to `fn2` in `main`.\n\nThe optimized code is now free of any unused variables and arrays, and it should run faster and use less memory.",
