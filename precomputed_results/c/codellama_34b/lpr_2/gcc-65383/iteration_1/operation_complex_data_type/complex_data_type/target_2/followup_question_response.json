The assignment to `g` has also been modified to use the new variable names.\n\nThe `main` function has been modified to call `fn2` with the new variable names.

The values of `h0`, `h1`, and `h2` are assigned to the corresponding elements of `h`. The function `fn2` is called and the return value is assigned to `q_real`. The value of `g` is then assigned to the element of `r_real` at index `[0x06D7][0x06D7][0x06D7]`. The optimized program is now free of any complex data types and is easier to analyze and modify.",
