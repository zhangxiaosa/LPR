Instead of using a loop, I have directly assigned the value of `q_real` to `g` and returned `q_real` from the function. This eliminates the need for the loop and improves the performance of the program.\n\nPlease note that this optimization assumes that the loop is not necessary for the program's correctness. If the loop is indeed required for some other reason, then this optimization should not be applied.",

This is because the `if` statement only depends on the value of `h2`, which is a constant, and does not depend on any variables that are modified within the loop. By moving the `if` statement out of the loop, we can avoid the overhead of checking the condition on every iteration of the loop.\n\nAdditionally, the `g` variable is assigned the value of `r_real[0x06D7][0x06D7][0x06D7]` only once, outside of the loop, since it does not depend on any variables that are modified within the loop. This avoids unnecessary computations and memory accesses.\n\nOverall, the optimized program should run faster and use less memory than the original program, since it avoids unnecessary computations and memory accesses.",
