Therefore, it can be optimized out by constant propagation and the value `0xC3` can be directly used in the `return` statement.\n* The variable `h2_real` is also a constant, so it can be optimized out by constant propagation and the value `0x92A1D2CD` can be directly used in the `if` statement.\n* The variable `g_real` is assigned the value `r_real[0x06D7][0x06D7]` in the function `fn2`, which is a constant. Therefore, it can be optimized out by constant propagation and the value `0x06D7` can be directly used in the `g_real` variable.\n* The variable `q_real_real` is also a constant, so it can be optimized out by constant propagation and the value `0xC3` can be directly used in the `main` function.\n\nNote that these optimizations can be done at compile-time, and the resulting program will be smaller and more efficient.",
