The `for` loop and the `if` statement have been moved into the `main` function, and the `g_real` variable has been removed.

The `for` loop is removed, and the `if` statement is evaluated at compile-time. Since `h2_real` is always 0, the `if` statement is always false, and the `return` statement is never executed. Therefore, the `g_real` variable is never assigned a value, and the `main` function always returns 0.",

The code for the `fn2` function has been inserted directly into the `main` function, and the call to `fn2` has been removed. This reduces the overhead of the function call and improves the performance of the program.\n\nNote that inlining the `fn2` function may also affect the size of the program, as the code for the function is no longer in a separate function but is now part of the `main` function. However, the overall performance of the program should be improved by inlining the function.",
