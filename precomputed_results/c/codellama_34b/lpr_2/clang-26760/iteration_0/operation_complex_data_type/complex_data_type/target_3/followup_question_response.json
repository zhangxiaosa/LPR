The value of `l` is always 1, so the expression `k >> l` is equivalent to `k >> 1` and `k << m` is equivalent to `k << 1`.\n\nTo optimize the code, we can replace the variable `l` with the constant 1 and simplify the expressions as follows:\n```\n#include <stdint.h>\n\nint16_t fn1() {\n  int8_t i;\n  int32_t j = 0x24F96B7BL;\n  uint32_t k;\n  for (uint32_t f = 0; f;) {\n    j -= 8;\n    i = j;\n  }\n  k = k >> 1;\n  if (i) {\n    k = k << 1;\n    goto q;\n  }\n}\n\nint main() {}\n```\nThis optimized code does not use the variable `l` and has the same behavior as the original code.",
