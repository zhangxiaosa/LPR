Additionally, the unrolling of the loop has reduced the number of iterations of the loop, which can improve the performance of the code.",

The `goto q` statement at the end of the loop has been removed, since it is no longer necessary.\n\nThe resulting program is smaller and faster, since the loop has been optimized away.
