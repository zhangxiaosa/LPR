This way, we can avoid the overhead of the loop and the conditional check inside the loop.\n\nNote that the `goto` statement is still used to jump to the label `q` when the condition `m` is true. However, this is a common technique in assembly language programming, and it is often used to optimize code by avoiding unnecessary branching.\n\nAlso, note that the `main` function is empty, as it does not perform any useful computation. The program is not meant to be run, but rather to demonstrate the optimization technique.",
