Constant propagation: The value of `fn1` is never changed, so we can replace all occurrences of `fn1` with its value, which is `{}`.\n2. Copy propagation: The variable `c` is assigned the value of `fn1`, which is `{}`. Since `c` is not used anywhere else in the program, we can eliminate the assignment to `c` and replace all occurrences of `c` with `{}`.\n\nThe optimized program is smaller and more efficient, as it removes the unnecessary variable `c` and reduces the number of instructions.",
