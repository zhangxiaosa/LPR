The modified program will then be:\n```\ntypedef long d __attribute__((__vector_size__(sizeof(long))));\nd fn2() {\n  d f = {fn1()};\n  return f;\n}\nmain() {}\n```\nThis program is also functionally equivalent to the original program, but it does not declare or use the variable `c`.",

For example, you could use a vector of integers or a vector of short integers, depending on the range of values you need to store. This could help reduce the memory usage and improve the performance of your program.",
