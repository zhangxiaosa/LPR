However, the variable `f` is never used outside of the `fn2` function, so it can be optimized out by constant propagation or copy propagation.\n\nBy using constant propagation, we can replace the expression `{fn1}` with its constant value, which is a vector of type `d` containing a single element of type `long` with the value of `fn1`. This will eliminate the need for the variable `f` altogether, resulting in a simpler and more efficient program.\n\nAlternatively, we can use copy propagation to eliminate the variable `f` by replacing all occurrences of `f` with the expression `{fn1}`. This will also result in a simpler and more efficient program, as the variable `f` is no longer needed.\n\nIn either case, the optimized program will have the same behavior as the original program, but with fewer instructions and less memory usage.",

If `fn1` has side effects or its output depends on external state, this optimization cannot be applied.",

The `fn1` function is also not used outside of the `fn2()` function, so it can be optimized out as well. The resulting program is smaller and more efficient.\n\nNote that in this case, we have performed both constant propagation and copy propagation. Constant propagation is the process of evaluating constant expressions and replacing them with their values. In this case, we have evaluated the constant expression `fn1` and replaced it with its value, which is the function `fn1`. Copy propagation is the process of propagating copies of variables to where they are used. In this case, we have propagated the copy of `fn1` to the return statement of `fn2`, which is where it is used.",
