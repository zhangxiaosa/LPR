The main function creates a complex data type from two primary data types and then decomposes it into variables with primary data type using the `decompose_complex_data_type` function.",

The `d` data type is now defined as a `union` of two `long` variables.\n\nWhen we call the `fn2` function, it returns a `d` value, which is assigned to the `result` variable.

Declare the primary data type variables that make up the complex data type `d`. In this case, `d` is a long integer vector with the same size as a long integer. We can declare the primary data type variables as follows:\n```less\ntypedef struct {\n  long x, y;\n} d;\n```\nThis declares a struct type `d` with two primary data type variables `x` and `y`, both of type long.\n\n2. Modify the function `fn2()` to use the primary data type variables instead of the complex data type `d`. We can do this by changing the function signature to use `d` instead of `vec<long>`:\n```less\nd fn2(d f) {\n  d result = {f.x, f.y};\n  return result;\n}\n```\nThis function takes a `d` parameter `f` and returns a new `d` value with the same values as `f`.\n\n3.
