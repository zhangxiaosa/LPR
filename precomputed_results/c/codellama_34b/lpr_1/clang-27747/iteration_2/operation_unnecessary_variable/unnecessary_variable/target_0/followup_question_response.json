This gives us:\n```\nstruct c {\n  int d : 18;\n  int e;\n  int g;\n};\nstruct c i;\nint main() {\n  struct c l;\n  l.d = i.e;\n  int n = i.d && l.d;\n  int p = l.d | -(l.d && l.d) - n;\n  i.g = p;\n}\n```\nNext, we can propagate the value of `l.d` to `n` and `p`, since `n` and `p` are not modified in the program. This gives us:\n```\nstruct c {\n  int d : 18;\n  int e;\n  int g;\n};\nstruct c i;\nint main() {\n  struct c l;\n  l.d = i.e;\n  int n = i.d && l.d;\n  int p = l.d | -(l.d && l.d) - n;\n  i.g = p;\n}\n```\nFinally, we can eliminate the unused variable `e`, since it is not used in the program.

Therefore, it can be optimized out by constant propagation or copy propagation.\n\nSince `e` is not used, we can replace all occurrences of `e` with a constant value (e.g., 0). This will simplify the program and eliminate the need for the variable `e`.\n\nIn the optimized program, the variable `l` is also not used, so we can optimize it out as well. This will further simplify the program, making it easier to read and analyze.\n\nThe final optimized program consists of only the `main` function, which no longer contains any unused variables or expressions.",
