Instead, the expression `i.d && l.d` is directly used in the calculation of `p`. This is possible because the value of `n` can be easily computed from the values of `i.d` and `l.d`, and the variable `n` is not used anywhere else in the program.\n\nBy eliminating the variable `n`, we have reduced the number of instructions in the program and made it more efficient.",

The expression `l.d && l.d` is also a constant expression and can be evaluated at compile-time, so it has been optimized out.

Since the variable `n` is never used in the program, we can eliminate its declaration and assign the value of the boolean expression directly to the variable `p`.\n\nAfter optimization, the program becomes:\n```\nstruct c {\n  int d : 18;\n  int g;\n};\nstruct c i;\nint main() {\n  struct c l;\n  l.d = i.d;\n  int p = l.d | -(l.d && l.d) - (i.d && l.d);\n  i.g = p;\n}\n```\n\nIn this optimized program, the variable `n` is no longer declared or used, and the boolean expression `i.d && l.d` is evaluated directly and assigned to the variable `p`. This optimization eliminates the need for an additional variable and reduces the size of the program.",
