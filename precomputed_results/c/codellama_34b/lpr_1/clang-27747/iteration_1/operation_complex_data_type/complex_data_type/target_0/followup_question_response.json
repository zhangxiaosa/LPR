The target variable `d` has been decomposed into a primary data type, which is an integer. The other variables have also been decomposed into primary data types. The program is now more efficient and easier to maintain.",

The original value of `d` is split into these two variables using bitwise operations, and the calculations involving `d` are performed on the decomposed variables instead. This should improve the performance of the program by reducing the number of bitwise operations required.",
