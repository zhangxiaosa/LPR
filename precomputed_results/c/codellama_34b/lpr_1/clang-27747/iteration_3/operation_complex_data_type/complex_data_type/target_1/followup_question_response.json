The `d` member is a 18-bit integer, and the `g` member is a 32-bit integer.\n\nThe program now uses the `l.d` and `l.g` members to perform the logical AND and bitwise OR operations, instead of using the `l` variable directly.

Declare the variables `d` and `g` as separate integers, instead of using a structure.\n2. Use a temporary variable `temp` to store the result of the logical AND operation.\n3. Use the bitwise AND operation to set the bits of `d` that are not set in `temp` to 0, and then use the bitwise OR operation to set the bits of `d` that are set in `temp` to 1.\n4. Assign the result of the bitwise OR operation to `g`.\n\nThe optimized program would look like this:\n```\nint d, g;\n\nint main() {\n  int temp = d & l;\n  d = (d & ~temp) | (temp & -temp);\n  g = d;\n  return 0;\n}\n```\nIn this optimized program, we have eliminated the need to access the `g` field of the structure `l`, and instead use a temporary variable `temp` to store the result of the logical AND operation. We have also used the bitwise AND and OR operations to perform the required operations on the `d` variable, which should be more efficient than using structure operations.\n\nNote that this optimization may not have the same behavior as the original program, as it is possible that the `g` field of the structure `l` was being used for something else in the original program.
