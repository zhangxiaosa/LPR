We also define a function `decomposeStruct` that takes a pointer to a structure of type `struct c` as an argument, and decomposes it into its primary data types.

We have also defined a new variable `l` of type `struct c`, and assigned the value of `i.d` to `l.d`. We have performed a logical AND operation on `i.d` and `l.d`, and stored the result in a new variable `n`.

We have also eliminated the unnecessary declaration of the variable `n` and the assignment of the result of the logical AND operation to `n`. Finally, we have eliminated the unnecessary declaration of the variable `p` and the assignment of the result of the bitwise OR operation to `p`. We have also moved the assignment of the result of the bitwise OR operation to `i.g` to the beginning of the program, to avoid unnecessary computations.",
