This eliminates the need to store the value of `g` in memory, reducing the memory usage of the program.\n\nNote that this optimization is only possible because the value of `g` is not used anywhere else in the program.

To optimize this variable, we will apply constant propagation and copy propagation techniques.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the program to identify the expressions that can be optimized:\n\n1. `i.e`: This expression is assigned to `m` and is never used again. We can optimize it out by constant propagation.\n2. `i.h`: This expression is used in the expression `i.h && l.d`, which is assigned to `n`. We can optimize it out by copy propagation.\n3. `l.d`: This expression is used in several places, including the assignment to `m`, the expression `l.d | -(l.d && l.d) - n`, and the assignment to `p`. We can optimize it out by copy propagation.\n\nNow, let's apply the optimizations to the program:\n\n```\nstruct c {\n  int d : 18;\n  int e;\n  int g;\n  int h;\n};\nstruct c i;\nint main() {\n  struct c l = {24, 6738, 165};\n  int m = 6738;\n  l.d = m;\n  int n = 165 && l.d;\n  int p = l.d | -(l.d && l.d) - n;\n  i.g = p;\n}\n```\n\nAs you can see, the program has been optimized by constant propagation and copy propagation.
