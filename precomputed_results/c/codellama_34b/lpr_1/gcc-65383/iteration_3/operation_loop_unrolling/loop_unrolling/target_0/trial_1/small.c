The optimization is done by unrolling the loop, which means that the loop is repeated 5 times, and the condition is checked after each iteration. If the condition is met, the loop is exited and the function returns. If the condition is not met, the loop continues until the end of the loop body is reached.

The optimized program is functionally equivalent to the original program, but it is faster because it avoids the overhead of the loop.
