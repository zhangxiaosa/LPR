The function takes two parameters, `p1` and `p2`, but `p1` is never used in the function body.

In this function, the variable `ad` is assigned a value of type `struct m` and is only used to access the member `o`. However, the member `o` is never modified, so we can propagate the value of `ad.o` to `ae` and simplify the function as follows:\n```\nint32_t fn4() {\n  struct m ad = {1957};\n  int32_t ae = ad.o;\n  ad.o = u;\n  r = ad.o % (~s / ae);\n}\n```\nFinally, let's apply copy propagation to the variable `r`.
