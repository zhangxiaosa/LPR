Given the following program and the variable in complex data type, decompose the it into variables with primary data type.. The program is int fn1(p2) { return p2; }
struct m {
  int n : 18;
  int o : 1;
};
int r;
static int s = -5;
int u;
int main() {
  struct m ad = {1957};
  ad.o = fn1(5);
  int ae = ad.o;
  ad.o = u;
  r = ad.o % (~s / ae);
}
.                 The target to be optimized is `ad`: struct m.

Here is the decomposition of the struct m into variables with primary data type:

int n = 1957;
int o = 5;

The program can be optimized by replacing the struct m with the decomposed variables, resulting in a more efficient and readable code:
