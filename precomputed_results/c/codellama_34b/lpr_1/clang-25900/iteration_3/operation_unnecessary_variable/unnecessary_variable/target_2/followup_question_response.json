The function takes an integer `p2` as an argument and returns it directly. Since `p2` is a constant, we can replace the function call with the value of `p2`.\n```\nint fn1(p2) {\n  return p2;\n}\n```\nbecomes\n```\nint fn1(p2) {\n  return 5;\n}\n```\nNext, let's perform copy propagation on the variable `ae`. The variable `ae` is assigned the value of `ad.o`, which is a member of the struct `m`. Since `ad.o` is a member of the struct `m`, we can replace the variable `ae` with `ad.o` directly.\n```\nint ae = ad.o;\n```\nbecomes\n```\nint ae = ad.o;\n```\nFinally, we can optimize out the variable `u` since it is not used in the program.\n```\nint u;\n```\nbecomes\n```\n// int u;\n```\nThe optimized program is:\n```\nstruct m {\n  int n : 18;\n  int o : 1;\n};\nint r;\nstatic int s = -5;\nint fn1(p2) {\n  return 5;\n}\nint main() {\n  struct m ad = {1957};\n  ad.o = fn1(5);\n  int ae = ad.o;\n  r = ad.o % (~s / ae);\n}\n```\nNote that the optimized program still has the same behavior as the original program, but it has been optimized to reduce the number of instructions and memory accesses.",
