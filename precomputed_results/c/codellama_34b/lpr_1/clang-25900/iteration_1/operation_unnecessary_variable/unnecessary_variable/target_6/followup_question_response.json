The variable `af` is not used, so it can be optimized out.\n2. The variable `ae` is assigned the value of `ad.o`, which is a constant. Therefore, `ae` can be replaced with the constant `1957` in the expression `ad.o % (~s / ae)`.\n3. The variable `u` is not used, so it can be optimized out.\n4. The variable `s` is a constant, so it can be replaced with its value in the expression `~s / ae`.\n\nThe optimized program is smaller and faster, and it eliminates the unused variables and constants.",

Constant propagation: The value of `s` is a constant, so we can calculate the value of `~s` directly and replace it in the expression `~s / ae`.\n2. Copy propagation: The value of `ad.o` is copied to `ae` and then used in the calculation of `r`. We can eliminate the variable `af` and use `ad.o` directly in the calculation of `r`.\n\nBy applying these optimizations, we can simplify the program and reduce the number of variables used.
