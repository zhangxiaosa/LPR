The value of `v` is known at compile-time, so it is not necessary to pass it as a function parameter or store it in memory. Instead, the value of `v` is propagated directly into the function `fn2` and used as a constant value in the expression `ad.o = fn1(v, 5)`. This avoids the overhead of passing a variable as a function parameter and allows the compiler to generate more efficient code.\n\nIn addition to optimizing out `v`, the program has also been optimized for other variables. The variable `u` is also optimized out by constant propagation, and the function `fn1` is inlined to avoid the overhead of a function call. The resulting program is more efficient and takes up less memory.",
