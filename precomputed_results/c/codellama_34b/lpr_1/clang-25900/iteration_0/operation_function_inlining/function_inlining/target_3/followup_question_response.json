This will reduce the overhead of the function call and improve the program's performance.\n\nAfter making these optimizations, the optimized program would look like this:\n```\ntypedef signed a;\ntypedef short b;\ntypedef int c;\ntypedef long d;\ntypedef unsigned e;\ntypedef unsigned f;\ntypedef unsigned g;\ne fn1(e p1, int p2) { return p2; }\nstruct k {\n  f l;\n};\nstruct m {\n  signed n : 18;\n  signed o : 1;\n};\na p;\nstruct k q;\nc r;\nstatic a s = -5L;\ng t;\nc u;\ng v;\na fn2(a, struct m, struct k, struct k, c);\n\nint main() {\n  struct m z;\n  struct k ad = {1957};\n  ad.o = fn1(v, 5);\n  a ae;\n  c af = t;\n  ae = ad.o;\n  ad.o = u;\n  r = af % (~s / ae);\n  ad.o;\n}\n```\nIn this optimized program, we have removed the unnecessary function call to `fn4` and inlined the function `fn2`.

It calls `fn2` with the parameters `p`, `z`, `q`, `q`, and `q.l`. To optimize `fn4`, we can inline the function call to `fn2` by copying the code of `fn2` into `fn4`.\n\nThe optimized code for `fn4` is as follows:\n```\nb fn4() {\n  struct m z;\n  struct m ad = {1957};\n  ad.o = fn1(v, 5);\n  a ae;\n  c af = t;\n  ae = ad.o;\n  ad.o = u;\n  r = af % (~s / ae);\n  ad.o;\n}\n```\nThe optimized code for `fn4` is the same as the original code for `fn2`, except that the parameter `p5` is not used. Therefore, the optimized code for `fn4` is equivalent to the original code for `fn2` with the parameter `p5` removed.",
