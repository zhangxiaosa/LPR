Here's the optimized program:\n```\ntypedef char b;\nint d;\nint e;\n\nb fn1() {\n  int h = 6L;\n  if (e)\n    goto i;\n  fn1();\n  b j;\n  return j;\ni:\n  d = h;\n  fn1();\n  j = 0xEEACFBBFL;\n  return j;\n}\n\nint main() {}\n```\nThis optimized program uses a single `h` variable, which makes the code simpler and easier to understand.",
