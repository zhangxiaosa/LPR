Therefore, the variable `temp` can be optimized out by constant propagation.\n\nHere's the optimized program:\n```\nint fn1(int *h) {\n  if (e) {\n    *h = 0xEEACFBBFL;\n    fn1(h);\n    return 0xEEACFBBFL;\n  }\n  fn1(h);\n  return 0xEEACFBBFL;\n}\n\nint main() {}\n```\nIn this optimized program, the variable `temp` has been removed, and the value 0xEEACFBBFL is directly used in the `return` statement.
