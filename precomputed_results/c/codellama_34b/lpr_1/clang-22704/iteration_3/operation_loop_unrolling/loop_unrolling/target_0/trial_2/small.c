Given the following program and the first line of a loop, optimize it out via loop unrolling.. The program is int e;
int fn1(int *h) {
  int temp = 0xEEACFBBFL;
  if (e) {
    *h = temp;
    fn1(h);
    return temp;
  }
  fn1(h);
  return temp;
}
int main() {}

.                 The target to be optimized is for (xxx) {.

After optimization:

int e;
int fn1(int *h) {
  int temp = 0xEEACFBBFL;
  if (e) {
    *h = temp;
    return temp;
  }
  fn1(h);
  return temp;
}
int main() {}

Explanation:

The loop with the target "for (xxx) {" is not present in the original program, so there is no optimization to be done.

Note: The original program has a recursive function call, which can be a performance bottleneck. It's worth considering if this is the intended behavior or if it could be optimized further.
