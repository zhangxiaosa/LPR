It is passed as an argument to the function `fn1` and is used to store the result of the function.\n* `fn1`: This is a function that takes a pointer to an integer as an argument and returns an integer. The function is recursive, meaning it calls itself until a certain condition is met.\n* `main`: This is the entry point of the program, where the program starts executing. It does not accept any arguments and does not return any value.\n\nThe variables with simple data types in the program are:\n\n* `int`: This is a keyword that declares a variable as an integer. It is used to declare the variables `e`, `h`, and `fn1`.\n* `0xEEACFBBFL`: This is a hexadecimal literal that represents a 32-bit integer value.
