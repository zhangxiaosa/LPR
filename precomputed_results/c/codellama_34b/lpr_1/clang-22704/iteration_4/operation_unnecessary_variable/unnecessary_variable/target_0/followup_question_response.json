Constant propagation: The variable `e` is always equal to 1, so the condition `if (e)` is always true. Therefore, the program can be optimized by constant propagation and the condition `if (e)` can be removed.\n2. Copy propagation: The variable `temp` is assigned the value `0xEEACFBBFL` and is then used as the return value of the function. Therefore, the variable `temp` can be eliminated and the value `0xEEACFBBFL` can be directly used as the return value of the function.\n\nThe optimized program is smaller and more efficient than the original program.",
