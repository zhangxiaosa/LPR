Copy propagation: The value of `j` is never modified in the program, so we can propagate the value of `j` to the initialization of `k` and eliminate the unnecessary assignment.\n3. Dead code elimination: The loop with the condition `for (; j; --j)` is dead code since `j` is never modified within the loop. We can eliminate the loop and the assignment to `k`.\n4. Dead code elimination: The loop with the condition `while (n)` is also dead code since `n` is never modified within the loop. We can eliminate the loop and the assignment to `k`.\n\nThe optimized program is:\n```\nint main() {\n  unsigned i;\n  unsigned k = 0x24F96B7BL;\n  while (k) {\n    k = k >> 1;\n  }\n}\n```\nNote that the optimized program still has the same functionality as the original program, but it is more efficient since it eliminates unnecessary code and uses constant propagation and copy propagation to reduce the number of instructions.",
