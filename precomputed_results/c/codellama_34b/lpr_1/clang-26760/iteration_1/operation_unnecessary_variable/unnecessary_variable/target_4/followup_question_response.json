Constant propagation:\nThe variable `j` is assigned the value `0x24F96B7BL` which is a constant. Therefore, the value of `j` can be propagated through the program and the variable `j` can be eliminated.\n2. Copy propagation:\nThe variable `k` is assigned the value `k >> 1` in the loop. The value of `k` is not modified in the loop, therefore the value of `k` can be propagated through the loop and the variable `k` can be eliminated.\n3. Unused variable elimination:\nThe variable `f` is not used in the program, therefore it can be eliminated.\n\nThe optimized program is:\n```\nint main() {\n  int i;\n  unsigned k;\n  for (int f; f;)\n    for (; 0; --j)\n      ;\n  int n = g;\n  while (n) {\n    k = k >> 1;\n    i = n;\n    if (i)\n      k = k << j;\n  }\n}\n```",
