Therefore, the variable `j` is not actually needed and can be removed from the program.\n\nAdditionally, the variable `i` is assigned the value of `n` in the loop, and this value is then used in the conditional statement. Since the value of `n` is not modified within the loop, the variable `i` can be removed and the loop can be simplified to:\n```\nwhile (n) {\n  k = k >> 1;\n  if (n)\n    k = k << 0x24F96B7BL;\n}\n```\nFinally, the variable `k` is assigned the value of `k >> 1` in the loop, and this value is then used in the conditional statement.
