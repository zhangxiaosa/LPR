The loop unrolling factor is 2, which means that the inner loop is executed twice as many times as the original loop.\n\nThe optimized program with loop unrolling is better than the original program in terms of performance, as it reduces the number of iterations of the inner loop and eliminates the need for the `goto` statement, which can be expensive in terms of performance. However, the optimized program with loop unrolling is more complex and may require more memory to store the additional instructions.",
