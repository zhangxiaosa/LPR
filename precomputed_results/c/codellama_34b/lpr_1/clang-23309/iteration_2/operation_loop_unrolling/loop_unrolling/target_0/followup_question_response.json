Here's the unrolled loop:\n```\nan = 250;\np2 = ac || (an = 3) == 0x294A85636008822D;\nif (fn2(fn3(0xBCD1, 1 - an), p2) & 1)\n  v = 1;\n\nan = 250;\np2 = ac || (an = 2) == 0x294A85636008822D;\nif (fn2(fn3(0xBCD1, 1 - an), p2) & 1)\n  v = 1;\n\nan = 250;\np2 = ac || (an = 1) == 0x294A85636008822D;\nif (fn2(fn3(0xBCD1, 1 - an), p2) & 1)\n  v = 1;\n```\nAs you can see, the loop has been unrolled, and the loop control variable `w` has been eliminated.
