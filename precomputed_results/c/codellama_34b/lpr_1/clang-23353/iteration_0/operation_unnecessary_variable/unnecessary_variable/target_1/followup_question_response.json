Constant propagation:\n\nThe variable `p1` in `fn1` is passed as an argument to `fn1` and is not modified inside the function. Therefore, the value of `p1` can be propagated from the call site to the function definition, and the function can be simplified as follows:\n```\nint fn1(char p2) { return p2 * 2; }\n```\n2. Copy propagation:\n\nThe variable `p2` in `fn1` is not modified inside the function, and it is only used to return the value of `p2` multiplied by 2. Therefore, the variable `p2` can be eliminated and the function can be simplified as follows:\n```\nint fn1(char p2) { return p2 * 2; }\n```\nThe optimized program is:\n```\nstruct g {\n  int h;\n};\nint i;\nstruct g j;\nint *fn2(unsigned p1, int *p2, char p3) {\n  for (p3 = 6; p3 != -7; p3--)\n    j.h ^= fn1(p3) && 1L;\n  return p2;\n}\nint main() { return 0; }\n```",
