The `fn2` function takes two integer arguments, `p1_int` and `p2_int`, and returns their difference. The `fn3` function takes a single integer argument, `p1_int`, and uses it to compute a value that is then stored in the `m` array. The `main` function is an empty function that returns 0.\n\nTo optimize the program, we can eliminate the `fn2` function and replace it with its associated original data type, which is `int`. We can also eliminate the `fn3` function and replace it with its associated original data type, which is `int`. The resulting optimized program is:\n```\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint k;\nint l;\nvolatile int m[5][8];\n\nint main() { return 0; }\n```\nThis program is shorter and more efficient than the original program, as it eliminates the unnecessary function calls and computations.",

However, I can suggest some general tips for optimizing the program:\n\n1. Use meaningful variable names: The program has several variables with generic names like `p1_int`, `p2_int`, `o`, `k`, `l`, and `m`. Using meaningful variable names can make the program easier to understand and optimize.\n2. Simplify the logic: The program has several nested loops and conditionals, which can make it difficult to understand and optimize. Try to simplify the logic by removing unnecessary loops and conditionals.\n3. Use constants: The program uses several integer constants, such as 5 and 8, which could be replaced with named constants to make the code more readable.\n4. Use functions: The program has several functions, but they are not used consistently. Try to use functions to encapsulate the logic of the program and make it more modular.\n5. Use appropriate data types: The program uses several data types, such as `int` and `volatile int`, which could be replaced with more appropriate data types to improve the performance and readability of the code.\n6. Use comments: The program has no comments, which can make it difficult to understand the intent of the code. Try to add comments to explain the logic and purpose of each part of the program.\n\nBy following these tips, you can improve the readability, maintainability, and performance of the program.",
