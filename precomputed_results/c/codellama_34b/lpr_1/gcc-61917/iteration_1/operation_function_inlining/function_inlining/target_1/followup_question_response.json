This has eliminated the function call overhead and made the program more efficient.",

This can potentially improve performance by reducing the number of function calls and allowing the compiler to better optimize the code. However, it's important to note that inlining can also increase code size, which can have a negative impact on performance if the code is too large. Therefore, it's important to consider the trade-offs when deciding whether or not to inline a function.",

Instead, we have directly called the function `fn2` with the appropriate arguments and assigned the result to the variable `o`.\n\nNote that inlining the function `fn3` has removed the need for the variable `p1_int` in the `main` function, as it is no longer used.
