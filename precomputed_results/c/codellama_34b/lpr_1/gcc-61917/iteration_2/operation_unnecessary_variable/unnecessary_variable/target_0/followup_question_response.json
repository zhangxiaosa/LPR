The variable `k` is a global variable and is used in the function `fn3` as a loop counter.\n2. The loop in `fn3` has a constant upper bound of 5, so the loop counter `k` can be optimized out by constant propagation.\n3. The variable `l` is not used in the loop, so it can be optimized out by copy propagation.\n4. The function `fn2` is not used in the program, so it can be optimized out by dead code elimination.\n\nThe resulting program has the same behavior as the original program, but it is smaller and more efficient.",
