The optimized program is given below:\n```\nint fn2(int p1_int, int p2_int) { return p1_int - p2_int; }\nint k;\nint l;\nint fn3(p1_int) {\n  int o;\n  for (;;) {\n    for (; l; l++)\n      for (k = 0; k >= -27; k = k - 6)\n        p1_int = fn2(o, p1_int);\n    p1_int || m[2][5];\n  }\n}\nint main() {}\n```\nThe optimized program is the same as the original program, except that the declaration of the variable `m` has been removed. This is because the variable `m` is not used in any way in the program, and it is not passed as an argument to any function. Therefore, the optimization can be performed by simply removing the declaration of the variable `m` from the program.",

The function takes `p1_int` as an argument, and it is not modified within the function. Therefore, we can replace all occurrences of `p1_int` within the function with the value of the argument.\n\nHere is the optimized program:\n```\nint fn2(int p1_int, int p2_int) { return p1_int - p2_int; }\nint k;\nint l;\nvolatile int m[5][8];\nint fn3(p1_int) {\n  int o;\n  for (;;) {\n    for (; l; l++)\n      for (k = 0; k >= -27; k = k - 6)\n        o = fn2(o, p1_int);\n    o || m[2][5];\n  }\n}\nint main() {}\n```\nIn this optimized program, we have removed all occurrences of `p1_int` within the function `fn3` and replaced them with the value of the argument.
