Here is an optimized version of the program:\n```\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint fn2(int p1, int p2) { return p1 - p2; }\n\nint main() { return 0; }\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe `typedef` statement is not necessary because it is not used in the program. The variables `k`, `l`, and `m` are not used, so they have been removed. The function `fn3` is not used, so it has been removed.\n\nThe program now consists of only two functions: `fn2` and `main`. The `fn2` function is used to subtract one integer from another, but it is not used in the program. The `main` function simply returns 0.\n\nThe program has been optimized to eliminate unused variables and functions, resulting in a simpler and more efficient program.",
