The `fn1` function is now defined as a macro, which is expanded inline when it is called. This avoids the overhead of a function call and allows the compiler to perform further optimizations.\n\nThe `goto` statement is also removed, as it is no longer necessary.\n\nThe `fn2` function is unchanged, as it does not call `fn1`.\n\nThe `main` function is also unchanged, as it does not call any of the other functions.",
