The value of `p4` is always 3, so it is not necessary to pass it as an argument to `fn1`. Instead, the constant value 3 is used directly in the function body. This eliminates the need for the variable `p4` and reduces the overall size of the program.\n\nNote that the optimization is only applied to the `fn1` function, as that is where the variable `p4` is defined and used. The optimization is not applied to the `fn2` function, as that function does not use the variable `p4`.",
