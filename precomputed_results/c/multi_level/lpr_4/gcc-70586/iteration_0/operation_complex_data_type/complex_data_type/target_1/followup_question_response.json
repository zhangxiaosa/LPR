There is another `if` statement that checks if the value of `i` is non-zero. If true, it again prints the value of `l`.\n9. The `fn3` function returns `p1`.\n10. The program defines a function `fn4` that doesn't take any parameters.\n11. Inside `fn4`, there is an `if` statement that calls the `fn3` function with the argument `1`. If the return value of `fn3` is non-zero, the statement does nothing.\n12. The `main` function is defined, which doesn't take any parameters. It calls the `fn4` function.\n\nTo optimize the variable `l`, we need to identify any unnecessary computations or assignments related to `l` and remove or simplify them. However, in the given program, there are no computations or assignments related to `l` apart from printing its value.\n\nSince the variable `l` is not initialized in the code, the optimization opportunity for `l` would involve initializing it with a specific value before any usage.
