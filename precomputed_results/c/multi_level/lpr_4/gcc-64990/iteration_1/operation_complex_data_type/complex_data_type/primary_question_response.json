The variable `g` is of type `signed` and has a complex data type as it is assigned a hexadecimal value. Therefore, `g` is identified as a variable with a complex data type.\n2. The variable `h` is of type `signed` and is assigned a hexadecimal value. Therefore, `h` is identified as a variable with a complex data type.\n3. The variable `i` is of type `signed` and does not have an assigned value. Therefore, `i` is identified as a variable with a simple data type.\n4. The variable `j` is an array of type `signed` with dimensions [5][5]. Therefore, `j` is identified as a variable with a complex data type.\n5. The variable `k` is of type `signed` and has a hexadecimal value. Therefore, `k` is identified as a variable with a complex data type.\n6. The variable `l` is a static variable of type `signed` and does not have an assigned value. Therefore, `l` is identified as a variable with a simple data type.\n7. The variable `m` is a multi-dimensional array of type `signed` with dimensions [9][2][3]. Therefore, `m` is identified as a variable with a complex data type.\n8. The variable `n` is of type `signed` and does not have an assigned value. Therefore, `n` is identified as a variable with a simple data type.\n9. The functions `fn2` and `fn3` are of type `signed` and have complex data types as they have return statements that involve variables with complex data types.\n\nBased on the analysis, the variables with complex data types are `g`, `h`, `j`, `k`, `m`, `fn2`, and `fn3`.
