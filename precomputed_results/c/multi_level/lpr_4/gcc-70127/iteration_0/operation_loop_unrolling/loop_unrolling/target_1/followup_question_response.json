Declare a variable `iterations` to store the number of loop iterations. Since the loop condition is always true, we need to determine the exact number of iterations based on the context of the program.\n2. Initialize `iterations` with the maximum value of `i` that would satisfy the loop condition (i.e., `i >= 0`).\n3. Unroll the loop by duplicating the loop body `iterations` times. Replace `i` with the unrolled iteration values.\n4. Modify the loop condition to terminate the loop after the unrolled iterations.
