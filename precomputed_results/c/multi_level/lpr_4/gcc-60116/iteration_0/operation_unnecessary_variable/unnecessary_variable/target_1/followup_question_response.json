Starting from the main function, we can see that `fn12()` is called.\n2. Analyzing `fn12()`, we find the declaration of `at` with the initial value of `1L`.\n3. Inside the nested loops, the value of `at` is used in the expression `fn2(ap, at)`, which is then passed as an argument to `fn3`.\n   - `fn2` uses `at` as the second parameter, but since the first parameter `ap` is not a constant, we cannot propagate its value into `fn2`.\n   - `fn3` does not use `at`, so we can safely eliminate the reference to `at` in this expression.\n4. Continuing with the expression `fn3(aj, fn2(ap, at))`, `fn3` can be simplified to just `aj` since the result of `fn2` is used only as a condition and `at` is a constant.\n5. The resulting expression is `fn3(aj, ap)`.\n   - `fn3` always returns `p2` (the second parameter), which is `ap` in this case.\n   - `fn3` does not use `aj`, so we can eliminate its reference as well.\n6. The expression further simplifies to just `ap`.\n7. The next step is to analyze the remaining expressions:\n   - `~(fn3(aj, fn2(ap, at)) != 0)` becomes `~(ap != 0)`.\n   - `fn5(ai, au_0 = fn8(~(fn3(aj, fn2(ap, at)) != 0), ak) && 0x57L))` becomes `fn5(ai, au_0 = fn8(~(ap != 0), ak) && 0x57L))`.\n     - Since `ap` is a constant and `!=` is not a bitwise operator, we can simplify `~(ap != 0)` to `ap == 0`.\n8. Analyzing further, we have `fn6(aq, fn5(ai, au_0 = fn8(ap == 0, ak) && 0x57L))`.\n   - `fn5` returns `p2`, which is `au_0` in this case.\n   - `fn6` returns `p2`, which is `fn5(ai, au_0 = fn8(ap == 0, ak) && 0x57L)` in this case.\n9. Simplifying `fn6`, we have `fn5(ai, au_0 = fn8(ap == 0, ak) && 0x57L)`.\n   - `fn5` returns `p2`, which is `fn8(ap == 0, ak) && 0x57L` in this case.\n10. Simplifying further, we have `fn8(ap == 0, ak) && 0x57L`.\n    - `fn8` returns `p1 + p2`, which is `ap == 0 + ak`.\n    - The expression `ap == 0` is a boolean expression that evaluates to either `0` (false) or `1` (true).\n    - Combining the logical AND operator `&&` with a constant `0x57L`, we can remove the reference to `ak`, as it doesn't affect the final result.\n11. The expression simplifies to `ap == 0 && 0x57L`.\n12. Continuing with the outermost conditional expression `(w >= (fn7(4UL, fn6(aq, fn5(ai, au_0 = fn8(~(fn3(aj, fn2(ap, at)) != 0), ak) && 0x57L))) > 2))`, we can simplify it as follows:\n    - `fn3(aj, fn2(ap, at))` becomes `ap`.\n    - `~(fn3(aj, fn2(ap, at)) != 0)` becomes `~(ap != 0)`.\n    - `fn8(~(fn3(aj, fn2(ap, at)) != 0), ak) && 0x57L` becomes `ap == 0 && 0x57L`.\n    - `fn5(ai, au_0 = fn8(~(fn3(aj, fn2(ap, at)) != 0), ak) && 0x57L))` becomes `fn5(ai, au_0 = ap == 0 && 0x57L)`.\n    - `fn6(aq, fn5(ai, au_0 = ap == 0 && 0x57L))` becomes `fn6(aq, ap == 0 && 0x57L)`.\n    - `fn7(4UL, fn6(aq, ap == 0 && 0x57L))` becomes `ap == 0 && 0x57L`.\n    - The final expression becomes `(w >= ap == 0 && 0x57L > 2)`.\n13. We can now go back to the original if-else statement and simplify the condition `(w >= (ap == 0 && 0x57L > 2))` to just `(w >= 1)`, as the condition is always true.\n14.
