The program declares the variable `loop_var` of type `int`.\n2. The program defines the `main` function.\n3. Inside the `main` function, the variable `q` of type `int` is declared.\n4. The value of `loop_var` is assigned to `q`.\n5. A `for` loop is started with the initialization of `loop_var` to 0.\n6. The loop continues as long as `loop_var` is less than 10.\n7. Inside the `for` loop, a `while` loop is executed as long as `q` is greater than `1L` (long integer).\n8. Inside the `while` loop, the value of `q` is decremented by 1.\n9. After the `for` and `while` loops complete, the `printf` function is called to print the value of `q` as a hexadecimal number.\n10.
