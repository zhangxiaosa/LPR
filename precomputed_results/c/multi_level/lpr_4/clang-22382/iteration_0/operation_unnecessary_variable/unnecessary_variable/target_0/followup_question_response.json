Let's perform a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. The variable `p` is declared in the `fn2` function as `struct h p;`.\n2. It is used as an argument in the function call `fn1(q, p1, 3, p);`.\n3. Within the `fn1` function, `p` is passed as an argument to `fn1` parameter `struct h p5`.\n4. Inside the `fn1` function, `p5.k;` statement is present, which accesses the `k` member of `p5`.\n\nConsidering the given code, the variable `p` is used at least once as an argument to the `fn1` function. Therefore, we cannot optimize it out completely because it might be needed within the function.\n\nHowever, if the variable `p` is declared but unused in the `main` function, we can optimize it out there.
