Constant Propagation: This optimization technique replaces the variable with its constant value where possible. However, in this case, `p3` is passed as a parameter to `fn1` as `q`. Since we don't have the actual value of `q` at compile time, constant propagation cannot be applied in this scenario.\n2. Copy Propagation: This optimization technique replaces a variable with another variable that has the same value. In the `fn2` function, `p3` is passed as `q` to `fn1`. Since `p3` is not used anywhere else in the program, we can replace all occurrences of `q` with `p3`.

The program includes the `<stdio.h>` header file.\n2. It defines a structure `h` with three members: `i` (signed integer), `j` (long), and `k` (unsigned integer).\n3. It declares a static function `fn1` that takes three arguments: `p3` (unsigned), `p4` (unsigned), and `p5` (struct h).\n4. Inside `fn1`, the `p5.k` variable is accessed, but since it is not used afterwards, it can be optimized out.\n5. `fn1` contains an infinite loop labeled as `w` using the `goto` statement.\n6. It declares an `unsigned` function `fn2` that doesn't take any arguments.\n7. Inside `fn2`, it declares two local variables: `p` (struct h) and `q` (int).\n8. It calls the `fn1` function with arguments `q`, `3`, and `p`.\n9. Then it enters an infinite loop using a `for` loop without any condition.\n10.

The target variable to be optimized is `p3`.\n\n`fn1` is a static function that takes three parameters: `p3`, `p4`, and `p5`. However, `p5` is unused in the function body. Therefore, we can optimize it out.\n\n`fn2` is an unsigned function that doesn't take any parameters. It declares a variable `p` of type `struct h` and an integer variable `q`. It then calls `fn1` with `q`, `3`, and `p` as arguments. After that, it enters an infinite loop where it repeatedly assigns `p` to itself and assigns the result to another variable `r`. The assignment `p = r = p` is redundant because it assigns `p` to `r` and then assigns `r` back to `p`.

This assignment is redundant because it assigns `p` to `r` and then assigns `r` back to `p`, resulting in `p` having the same value as before.
