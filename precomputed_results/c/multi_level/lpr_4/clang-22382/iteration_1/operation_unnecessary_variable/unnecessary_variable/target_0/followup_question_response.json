We need to optimize out the variable `i` in the given program.\n2. In the `struct h` definition, the variable `i` is defined but not used anywhere in the program. Therefore, it can be optimized out by removing the declaration and usage of `i` from the struct definition.\n3. In the `fn1` function, the expression `p5.k` does not have any side effects and does not affect the program's behavior. Therefore, it can be removed as well.\n4. In the `fn2` function, the variable `p` of type `struct h` is assigned the value of `r`, which is also of type `struct h`. Since `r` is immediately assigned the value of `p`, the assignment `p = r = p` is redundant and can be optimized to `p = p`.\n5. These optimizations do not affect the behavior of the program since the unused variable `i` and unused expression `p5.k` are removed, and the redundant assignment is simplified.\n6.
