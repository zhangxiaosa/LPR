Loop unrolling is a technique that aims to reduce the overhead of loop control by executing multiple iterations of the loop in a single iteration. Here's the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. We have a target loop `for (;;)`. Since the loop is infinite and contains no break or return statements, it will run indefinitely until interrupted externally.\n\n2. The loop body assigns the value of `r` to both `p` and `r`. This assignment does not have any impact on the program's behavior since `r` is overwritten by the subsequent `p = r` assignment.\n\n3. To apply loop unrolling, we will unroll the loop by replacing it with a sequence of statements that replicate the behavior of each iteration.\n\n4. Since the loop is infinite, it means that there are no specific termination conditions. We can decide on the number of unrolled iterations based on the desired level of optimization.\n\n5. In this case, let's unroll the loop by 4 iterations. We will replicate the loop body 4 times.\n\n6.

The target loop `for (;;) {` is an infinite loop with no loop control instructions.\n2. We'll unroll the loop by replicating the body of the loop multiple times.
