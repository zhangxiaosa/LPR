Analyze the function `fn2`:\n\n```C\nunsigned fn2() {\n  struct h p;\n  fn1(p);\n  while (1) {\n    struct h r;\n    p = r = p;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n3. Notice the function call to `fn1(p)` inside `fn2`.\n4. Inline the function `fn1` into `fn2` by replacing the function call with its code:\n\n```C\nunsigned fn2() {\n  struct h p;\n  struct h p5 = p;\n  p5.k;\n  while (1) {\n  }\n  while (1) {\n    struct h r;\n    p = r = p;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n5. The code `return p5.i;` is removed since `fn1` does not have a return statement.\n\n6. Update the `main` function to include a call to the modified `fn2` function:\n\n```C\nint main() {\n  fn2();\n}\n```\n\n7. The final program, after optimizing `fn2` through function inlining, is as follows:\n\n```C\nstruct h {\n  int i;\n  long j;\n  int k;\n};\n\nstatic struct h fn1(struct h p5) {\n  p5.k;\n  while (1) {\n  }\n}\n\nunsigned fn2() {\n  struct h p;\n  struct h p5 = p;\n  p5.k;\n  while (1) {\n  }\n  while (1) {\n    struct h r;\n    p = r = p;\n  }\n}\n\nint main() {\n  fn2();\n}\n```\n\n8.

Inside `fn2`, there is a call to the `fn1` function with the `p` argument. We can optimize this call by inlining the `fn1` function directly into `fn2`.\n\n4. Inlining `fn1` into `fn2`, the contents of `fn1` completely replace the function call. So the body of `fn1` will be moved to the position where the function call was.\n\n5. After inlining, the `while (1)` loop in `fn2` becomes unreachable, as it is placed after the inlined code of `fn1` and will never be executed.\n\n6. The `struct h r;` and the assignment `p = r = p;` in `fn2` are also unreachable after the inlining of `fn1` because they are inside the unreachable `while (1)` loop.\n\n7.
