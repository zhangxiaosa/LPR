In this program, `p2` is used as an argument in the `fn4` function call within the loop in `fn11`. Therefore, `p2` is not unused, and we cannot optimize it out completely.\n\nStep 3: Apply Constant Propagation or Copy Propagation\nSince we cannot optimize `p2` out completely, we can perform constant propagation or copy propagation to optimize its usage.\n\nIn the given program, `p2` is not a constant value, so constant propagation is not applicable.

The `fn2` function takes two parameters `p1` and `p2`, but it only returns `p1`. Therefore, `p2` is not used in this function.\n2. The `fn4` function takes two parameters `p1` and `p2`, and it returns the sum of `p1` and `p2`. However, this function is not called in the given program, so `p2` is not used here either.\n3. The variable `u` and `v_0_3` are declared as `int` and are initialized outside any function, making them global variables.\n4. The `fn11` function initializes a local variable `d` with the value 2.\n5. In the `for` loop, it loops until `u` is less than 51. In each iteration, it assigns the result of `fn4(fn2(v_0_3 = d, 3), 0x9EE7F9D1C772505BLL)` to `d`, where `v_0_3` is assigned the value of `d`. However, `p2` is not used in this loop.\n6. After the loop, the value of `v_0_3` is printed using `printf`.\n\nOptimization steps:\n1. Since `p2` is not used in `fn2` or `fn4`, we can remove the parameter `p2` from both functions.\n2. In the `fn11` function, since `p2` is not used in the expression `fn4(fn2(v_0_3 = d, 3), 0x9EE7F9D1C772505BLL)`, we can replace `p2` with its actual value `0x9EE7F9D1C772505BLL`.\n3.
