Define an array `m` of unsigned integers with size 4: `unsigned m[4];`\n2. Define a structure `i` with three integers: `int j; int k; int l;`\n3.

Define another function `fn2` that takes an integer `p1`, a structure `i` `p2`, an unsigned integer `p3`, and a short integer `p4` as parameters. It returns a structure `i`. Inside the function, it defines a structure `v` and initializes its `j` and `k` members. It also defines two integer variables `w` and `a`. The function includes a conditional statement and several nested loops along with assignments and comparisons: `struct i fn2(int p1, struct i p2, unsigned p3, short p4) { ... }`\n6. Define a function `fn3` that takes a single parameter `p1` of unknown type and returns an unsigned integer. Inside the function, it creates a 2D array `q` of type `unsigned char` and size 7x7.
