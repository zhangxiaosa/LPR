Inside `main`, a struct `p2` is declared with two bit fields `n` and `o`. The `n` field uses 18 bits, and the `o` field uses 1 bit. The `n` field is assigned the value `1957`.\n5. The `o` field of `p2` is assigned the result of calling `fn1` with arguments `5` and `5`.\n6. The value of `p2.o` is assigned to `ae`.\n7. The `o` field of `p2` is assigned the value of `u`.\n8. The value of `t` modulo the bitwise negation of `s` divided by `ae` is assigned to `r`.\n9.
