In the `main` function, the variable `p2` of type `struct` is declared and initialized with the value `{1957}`.\n\n3. The `o` member of `p2` is assigned the value returned by `fn1(5, 5)`. Since `fn1` simply returns its second parameter, `p2.o` is now `5`.\n\n4. The value of `p2.o` is assigned to the variable `ae`. The value of `ae` is now `5`.\n\n5. `p2.o` is assigned the value `0`. Now `p2.o` is `0`.\n\n6. The expression `~s / ae` is evaluated. The `~` operator is the bitwise negation, which inverts the bits of `s`. The value of `s` is `-5`, so after bitwise negation, `~s` becomes `4` (assuming a signed 8-bit representation of `char`). Then, `4 / ae` is performed, which results in `4 / 5` (integer division), resulting in `0`.\n\n7. The expression `r = r % 0` is evaluated. Since the right-hand side value is constant and evaluates to `0`, this expression will cause a runtime error due to division by zero.\n\n8. The value of `p2.o` is accessed, but its result is unused.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can conclude that the variable `p1` is not used in the given program.
