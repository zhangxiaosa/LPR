Then, we can replace all the references to `p2` with the constant or copied value.\n\nHere are the step-by-step optimizations:\n\n1. The variable `p2` is assigned a constant value of `1957` during its declaration. We can replace all references to `p2` with this constant value.\n\n2. The function call `fn1(5, 5)` assigns the value of `p2.o` as `5`. We can replace all subsequent references to `p2.o` with this constant value of `5`.\n\n3. After the assignment `ae = p2.o`, the value of `ae` becomes `5`. We can replace all subsequent references to `ae` with this constant value.\n\n4. The assignment `p2.o = 0` updates the value of `p2.o` to `0`. We can replace all subsequent references to `p2.o` with this constant value of `0`.\n\n5. The expression `r % (~s / ae)` involves the variables `r`, `s`, and `ae`. Since the value of `ae` is `5` and it is not modified further, we can replace all references to `ae` with this constant value.\n\n6.
