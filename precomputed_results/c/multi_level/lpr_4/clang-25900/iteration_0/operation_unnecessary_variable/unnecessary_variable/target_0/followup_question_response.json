The target variable to be optimized is `ae`, which is assigned the value of `p2.o`.\n\n2. In the statement `ae = p2.o;`, `p2.o` is assigned the value returned by the function `fn1(v, 5)`. Since `p2.o` is of type `int`, the function call `fn1(v, 5)` returns an `int` value.\n\n3. The `fn1` function simply returns the value of its second parameter `p2`, so in this case, `fn1(v, 5)` is equivalent to `5`.\n\n4. Therefore, the assignment `ae = p2.o` simplifies to `ae = 5`.\n\n5. Since the value of `ae` is a constant `5`, it can be propagated throughout the program.\n\n6. In the statement `r = af % (~s / ae);`, the expression `~s / ae` can be simplified to `~(-5L) / 5`, which evaluates to `-(-6L) / 5` and further simplifies to `6L / 5`.\n\n7. Since the values of `6L` and `5` are constants, the expression `6L / 5` can be computed at compile-time and its result can replace the expression in the assignment statement. Assuming integer division, `6L / 5` evaluates to `1`.\n\n8. Therefore, the statement `r = af % (~s / ae);` simplifies to `r = af % 1`, which further simplifies to `r = 0`.\n\n9.
