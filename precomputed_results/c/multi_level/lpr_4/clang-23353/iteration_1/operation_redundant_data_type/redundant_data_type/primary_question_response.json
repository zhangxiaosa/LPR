The program starts with a function definition:\n   ```\n   char fn1(char p1, char p2) {\n     return p1 * p2;\n   }\n   ```\n\n   - The function name is `fn1`.\n   - The return type is `char`.\n   - The parameters are `p1` and `p2`, both of type `char`.\n\n2. After the function definition, there are three variable declarations:\n   ```\n   int i;\n   signed j_h;\n   int p3;\n   ```\n\n   - The variable `i` has type `int`.\n   - The variable `j_h` has type `signed` (which is equivalent to `int`).\n   - The variable `p3` has type `int`.\n\n3.
