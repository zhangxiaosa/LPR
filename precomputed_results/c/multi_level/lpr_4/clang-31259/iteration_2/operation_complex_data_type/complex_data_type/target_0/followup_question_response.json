The variable `ad1` has dimensions `[][5][7]`, and its initial values are provided.\n4. The `fn9` function uses a local integer array `ai`, an integer `i`, and several loop constructs to modify `ad1`.\n5. The `main` function calls `fn9`, access a specific element of `ad1`, and prints its value.\n6. Other global variables in the program are `u`, `v`, `w`, and `af`, which are all of type `int`.\n7. The program also includes two defined functions `fn3` and `fn4`, which take two integer parameters and return an integer.\n\nNow, let's decompose the program into variables with primary data types:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"program\": \"int fn3(int p1, int p2) { return 1; }\\n\\\nint fn4(int p1, int p2) { return 1 % p2; }\\n\\\nint u;\\n\\\nint v;\\n\\\nstatic int w = 254;\\n\\\nint ad1[][5][7] = {{{8}, {8}, {{8}, 0x98}}};\\n\\\nint af;\\n\\\nint fn9() {\\n\\\n  int ai[2];\\n\\\n  int i;\\n\\\n  for (i = 0; i < 2; i++)\\n\\\n    ai[i] = 8;\\n\\\n  for (w = 1;;) {\\n\\\n    for (; i < 5; i += 2)\\n\\\n      ;\\n\\\n    for (af = 6; af >= 0; af -= 1)\\n\\\n      v = ai[0] ^= ad1[w + 1][w][af] = fn4(fn3(1, u--), 4294967295);\\n\\\n    return 0;\\n\\\n  }\\n\\\n}\\n\\\nint main() {\\n\\\n  fn9();\\n\\\n  int s;\\n\\\n  s = ad1[2][1][0];\\n\\\n  printf(\\\"s_unrolled_iter_1 = %X\\\\n\\\", s);\\n\\\n  return 0;\\n\\\n}\"\n}\n```\n\nThe decomposed program replaces the complex data type `ad1` with a multidimensional array initialized with the provided values.
