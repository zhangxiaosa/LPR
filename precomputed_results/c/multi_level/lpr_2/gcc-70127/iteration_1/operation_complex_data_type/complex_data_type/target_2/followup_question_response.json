In this case, `w` is of type `struct p`, which has two fields: `ab` of type `int` and `q` of type `int` with a bit field width of 22.\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis of the program:\n\n1. Include the necessary header file:\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n```\n\n2. Define the structure `p` with fields `ab` and `q`:\n```c\nstruct p {\n  int ab;\n  int q : 22;\n};\n```\n\n3. Declare variables `j` and `u` of type `unsigned`:\n```c\nunsigned j;\nunsigned u;\n```\n\n4. Declare an array `v` of type `struct p`, with a size of 1:\n```c\nstruct p v[1];\n```\n\n5. Initialize variable `w` of type `struct p` using initializer list:\n```c\nstruct p w = {0x1C87E74Fu, 816u};\n```\n\n6. Define the function `print_checksum` to print the checksum value:\n```c\nvoid print_checksum(int checksum) {\n  printf(\"checksum = %X\\n\", checksum);\n}\n```\n\n7. Start the `main` function:\n```c\nint main() {\n```\n\n8. Declare and initialize variable `a` of type `struct p`:\n```c\n  struct p a = {8L, 666};\n```\n\n9. Start a `for` loop with condition `u <= 1` and update `u` by adding 1:\n```c\n  for (; u <= 1; u += 1) {\n```\n\n10. Assign `w` to `a` and `v[0]`:\n```c\n    a = v[0] = w;\n```\n\n11. Assign `a` to `v[0]`:\n```c\n    v[0] = a;\n```\n\n12. Close the `for` loop:\n```c\n  }\n```\n\n13. Assign the value of `q` field from `v[0]` to variable `j`:\n```c\n  j = v[0].q;\n```\n\n14. Call the `print_checksum` function with `j` as the argument:\n```c\n  print_checksum(j);\n```\n\n15.
