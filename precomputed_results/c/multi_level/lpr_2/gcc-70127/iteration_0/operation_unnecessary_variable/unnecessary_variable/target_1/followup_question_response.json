Therefore, constant propagation is not possible.\n\n2. We need to analyze the usage of `p2` inside the nested `for` loop in the `fn5` function. The loop condition `p2 >= 0` indicates that `p2` is used to control the loop termination. Since the loop termination depends on the value of `p2`, we cannot optimize it out.\n\n3.

This argument is unused inside the `fn5` function, so we can optimize it out by removing the corresponding argument.\n\n4. After analyzing the rest of the code, `p2` is not used again.
