This is essentially a copy operation.\n   - Since `r1` is a copy of `p`, and `p` is not modified within the loop, `r1` will always have the same value as `p`.\n   - Therefore, we can replace all occurrences of `r1` with `p` within the loop.\n3.

In the `fn2` function, the `r1` variable is declared inside the infinite `for` loop. Since it's not used outside this loop, we can optimize it out.\n\n4. Inside the loop, the assignment `p = r1 = p` assigns the value of `p` to `r1`, which is then assigned back to `p`. This assignment can be simplified to `p = p`, which effectively does nothing. Therefore, the assignment to `r1` is unnecessary and can be optimized out.\n\n5. The `fn1` function is called from `fn2`, but the `r1` variable is not used within `fn1`. Therefore, optimizing it out won't have any effect on the program.\n\n6.
