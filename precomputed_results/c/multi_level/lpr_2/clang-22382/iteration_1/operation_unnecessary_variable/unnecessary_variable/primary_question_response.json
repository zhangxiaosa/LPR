The program defines a function `fn1` that returns a struct `h` and takes four parameters: `p1`, `p3`, `p4`, and `p5`.\n   - Inside `fn1`, the statement `p5.k;` accesses the member `k` of the struct `p5`, but the result is not used.\n   - The function contains an infinite loop labeled `w` and a `goto` statement `goto w;`.\n7.
