Inside `fn2`, there is a declaration of a structure variable `p` of type `struct h` and a variable `q` of type `b` (which is an alias for `int`). The function `fn1` is called with arguments `q`, `l`, `p1`, `3`, and `p`.\n6. Inside `fn2`, there is an infinite loop with a declaration of a structure variable `r` of type `struct h`. This loop assigns `r` to `p` and `p` to itself, which essentially does nothing.\n7. The function `fn1` is defined after `fn2`. It takes five arguments `f p1`, `a p2`, `g p3`, `d p4`, and a structure `p5` of type `struct h`.\n8.
