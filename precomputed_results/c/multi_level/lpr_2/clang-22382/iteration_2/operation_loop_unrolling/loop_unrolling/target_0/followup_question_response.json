Define the loop unrolling factor. In this case, we'll choose a factor of 4, which means unrolling the loop four times.\n\n2. Replace the `for (;;) { ... }` loop with four iterations of the loop body, separated by semicolons. This will result in a repeated sequence of loop body statements.\n\n3. Initialize a variable `unroll_count` to keep track of how many unroll iterations have been completed. Set its initial value to 0.\n\n4. Enclose the loop body statements in an `if` condition that checks if `unroll_count` is less than the desired unrolling factor. If it is, execute the loop body statements; otherwise, exit the loop.\n\n5.
