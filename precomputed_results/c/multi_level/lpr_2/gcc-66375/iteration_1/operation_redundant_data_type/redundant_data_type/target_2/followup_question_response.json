The program includes the standard input/output header file `stdio.h`, which provides functions for input and output operations.\n2. The program defines a new data type `g` using the `typedef` keyword, which represents an unsigned integer.\n3. The program declares a variable `u` of type `g` (unsigned integer).\n4. The program declares an array `v` of type `g` with a size of 4.\n5. The program defines a function `fn2` that takes two parameters: a `char` and an `int` and returns a `char`. The function simply returns the value of the first parameter `p1`.\n6. The program declares a variable `d` of type `int` and initializes it with the value 2L (long integer).\n7. The program enters a `for` loop that iterates as long as `u` is less than 51.\n8. Inside the loop, it assigns the value of `d` to the fourth element of the array `v`.\n9. It then updates the value of `d` by calling the `fn2` function with the fourth element of `v` and the literal value 3, and adding a large constant value.\n10. After the loop, it prints the value of the fourth element of `v` as a hexadecimal number using `printf`.\n11. The program returns 0 to indicate successful execution.\n\nTo eliminate the data type `g` and substitute it with its associated original data type `unsigned int`, we need to modify the `typedef` line and replace all occurrences of `g` with `unsigned int` in the program.
