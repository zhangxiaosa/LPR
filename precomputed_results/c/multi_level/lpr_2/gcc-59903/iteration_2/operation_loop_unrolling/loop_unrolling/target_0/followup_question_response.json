Define the loop unrolling factor 'N'. For example, let's choose 'N' as 4.\n2. Replace the target loop with an unrolled version that executes 'N' iterations in each iteration of the unrolled loop.\n3. Initialize 'a' to 'N' before entering the unrolled loop.\n4. Modify the loop condition to 'a >= N' to ensure that 'N' iterations are executed in each iteration of the unrolled loop.\n5. Decrement 'a' by 'N' in each iteration of the unrolled loop.\n6. Unroll the loop body 'N' times, duplicating the loop statements 'N' times.\n7. After the unrolled loop, execute any remaining iterations that are fewer than 'N' in a separate loop.\n8. Update the loop increment to 'a += N' at the end of each iteration of the unrolled loop.\n9.

Loop unrolling is a technique that duplicates the loop body multiple times and reduces the number of iterations.\n\nIn this case, we can unroll the loop by a factor of 4, as the loop increment is `a += 1` and the condition is `a`. Therefore, for each iteration of the original loop, we will have four iterations in the unrolled loop.\n\nHere's the modified program after loop unrolling:\n\n```c\nunsigned k;\nunsigned m[4];\nunsigned n0;\nunsigned fn3() {\n  unsigned r;\n  unsigned s;\n  unsigned v;\n  unsigned w;\n  unsigned a;\n  for (; w; w += 1)\n    for (s = 0; s <= 39; ++s)\n      for (r = 0; r <= 2; r += 1) {\n        n0 = v;\n        v = m[r];\n        w = n0 && k;\n        for (; a; a -= 4) {\n          n0 = 0u;\n          n0 = 0u;\n          n0 = 0u;\n          n0 = 0u;\n        }\n      }\n  return 0;\n}\nint main() {}\n```\n\nIn the unrolled loop, the value of `a` is decremented by 4 in each iteration instead of 1, and the loop body is duplicated 4 times.
