The program declares a global variable `g` of type `int`.\n2. The `main` function is defined.\n3. Inside the `main` function:\n   - A local variable `j` of type `int` is declared and initialized with the hexadecimal value `0x24F96B7BL`.\n   - An unsigned variable `k` is declared.\n   - A conditional statement `if (j)` is used to check if the value of `j` is nonzero. If it is, the code inside the if block is executed.\n   - Inside the if block, `--j` decrements the value of `j` by 1.\n   - A label `q` is defined.\n   - The value of `k` is right-shifted by 1 using the `>>` operator.\n   - Another conditional statement `if (g)` is used to check if the value of `g` is nonzero. If it is, the code inside the if block is executed.\n   - Inside the if block, the value of `k` is left-shifted by `j` using the `<<` operator.\n   - The program jumps to the label `q` using the `goto` statement.\n4.
