First, we remove the declaration and assignment of `p`.\n4. Next, we remove the condition `if (p)` since it no longer serves any purpose.\n5.

Starting with the declaration of `int p = g`, we can see that `p` is assigned the value of `g`. Since `g` is a global variable and is not modified within the program, we can replace `p` with `g` throughout the program.\n\n2. In the `if` condition `if (j)`, `j` is checked for its truthiness. However, since `j` is a constant value `0x24F96B7B`, this condition will always evaluate to true. Therefore, the `if` statement and the decrement `--j` can be removed.\n\n3. After the removal of the `if` statement, the `goto q` becomes an infinite loop. Since the loop is infinite and `p` is always zero, the assignment `k = k << j` can also be removed. This means that the label `q` and the `goto q` statement become unused and can be removed as well.\n\n4.
