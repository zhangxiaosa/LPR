We declare two instances of `struct c`, `i`, and `j`.\n4. In the `main` function:\n   - We declare a struct `c` variable `l` and initialize it with the values `{24, 6738, 165}`.\n   - We assign the value of `j.e` to `l.d`.\n   - We declare a variable `n` of type `b` and assign it the value of `j.h && l.d`.\n   - We declare a variable `o` of type `b` and assign it the value of `l.d`.\n   - We declare a variable `p` of type `signed` and assign it the result of `o | -(l.f && l.d) - n`.\n   - We assign the value of `p` to `i.g`.\n\nIn this program, the variable `o` is assigned the value of `l.d` and is used later in the code.
