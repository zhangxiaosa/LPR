Replace the occurrence of \"i\" and \"j\" with \"struct c i\" and \"struct c j\" respectively since they are struct variables.\n\n5. Replace the occurrence of \"l\" with \"struct c l\" since it is a struct variable.\n\n6.

Replace the occurrence of \"n\" with \"(j.h && l.d)\" since its value is based on the logical AND operation.\n\n8.

Analyzing the program:\n- The program defines a data type `typedef signed a` which we want to eliminate and substitute with its associated original data type.\n- It also defines a data type `typedef int b` which should remain unchanged.\n- The program then declares a structure `struct c` with several member variables of different data types.\n- Two instances of the structure `struct c` named `i` and `j` are declared.\n- The `main` function initializes an instance of the structure `l` with specific values.\n- It assigns the value of `j.e` (which has data type `b`) to `l.d` (which initially has data type `a`).\n- It performs logical and arithmetic operations using `j.h`, `l.d`, `l.f`, and `n`.\n- Finally, it assigns the value of the expression `- (l.f && l.d) - n` (which has data type `b`) to `i.g` (which originally has data type `a`).\n\n2. Eliminating and substituting `typedef signed a`:\n- Since `a` is a typedef for `signed`, we can directly replace `a` with `signed` throughout the program.\n\n3. Obtaining the modified program:\nThe modified program with the substitution of `a` with `signed` is as follows:\n```c\ntypedef int b;\nstruct c {\n  signed d : 18;\n  unsigned e;\n  unsigned f;\n  signed g;\n  signed h;\n};\nstruct c i;\nstruct c j;\nint main() {\n  struct c l = {24, 6738, 165};\n  b m = j.e;\n  l.d = m;\n  b n = j.h && l.d;\n  b o = l.d;\n  signed p = o | -(l.f && l.d) - n;\n  i.g = p;\n}\n```\n\n4.
