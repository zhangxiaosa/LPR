Here's the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. The declaration `signed ad[][5][7]` indicates a 3-dimensional array with an unknown size for the first dimension, size 5 for the second dimension, and size 7 for the third dimension.\n\n2. The initialization of `ad` with `{{8}, {8}, {{8}, 0x98}}` initializes the array with values. Let's break it down:\n\n   - The first element of `ad` is `{8}`. Since the second and third dimensions have fixed sizes, we can determine that `ad[0][0][0]` is initialized with the value 8.\n\n   - The second element of `ad` is also `{8}`, indicating that `ad[1][0][0]` is initialized with the value 8.\n\n   - The third element of `ad` is `{{8}, 0x98}`. The second dimension remains the same, but the third dimension has two values. Therefore, `ad[2][0][0]` is initialized with the value 8, and `ad[2][0][1]` is initialized with the value 0x98 (152 in decimal).\n\n3. To decompose `ad` into variables with primary data types, we'll need to consider the array dimensions and values:\n\n   - `ad` is a 3-dimensional array, so we'll need three variables to represent the dimensions.\n\n   - Based on the analysis above, we can assign primary data types to the variables:\n\n     - `signed ad_dim1_size` (size of the first dimension) with the value 3 (number of elements in `ad`).\n     - `signed ad_dim2_size` (size of the second dimension) with the value 5.\n     - `signed ad_dim3_size` (size of the third dimension) with the value 7.\n\n   - Additionally, we'll need variables to represent the initialized values:\n\n     - `signed ad_0_0_0` with the value 8.\n     - `signed ad_1_0_0` with the value 8.\n     - `signed ad_2_0_0` with the value 8.\n     - `signed ad_2_0_1` with the value 152.\n\n4. The rest of the program does not modify or access the `ad` array directly, so no additional variables need to be decomposed from the program.\n\nBased on the analysis above, here's the final program decomposed into variables with primary data types:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"program\": \"signed fn2(signed p1, signed p2) { return p1; }\\n\\nint fn4(int p1, int p2) { return p1 % p2; }\\n\\nunsigned s;\\nunsigned u;\\nint v;\\nstatic unsigned w = 254;\\nsigned ad[][5][7]; // Decomposed array declaration\\n\\n// Decomposed variables for array dimensions\\nsigned ad_dim1_size = 3;\\nsigned ad_dim2_size = 5;\\nsigned ad_dim3_size = 7;\\n\\n// Decomposed variables for initialized values\\nsigned ad_0_0_0 = 8;\\nsigned ad_1_0_0 = 8;\\nsigned ad_2_0_0 = 8;\\nsigned ad_2_0_1 = 152;\\n\\nint af;\\nvoid fn9() {\\n  int ai[2];\\n  unsigned i;\\n  for (i = 0; i < 2; i++)\\n    ai[i] = 8;\\n  w = 1;\\n  for (; i < 25; i += 20) {\\n  }\\n  for (af = 6; af >= 0; af -= 1)\\n    v = ai[0] ^= ad[w + 1][w][af] = fn4(fn2(1, u--), 4294967295U);\\n}\\n\\nint main() {\\n  unsigned i;\\n  fn9();\\n  for (i = 0; i < 5; i++)\\n    s = s ^ ad[2][i][0];\\n  printf(\\\"checksum = %X\\\\n\\\", s);\\n  return 0;\\n}\"\n}\n```\n\nNote: The program is provided as a JSON object wrapped in Markdown syntax.
