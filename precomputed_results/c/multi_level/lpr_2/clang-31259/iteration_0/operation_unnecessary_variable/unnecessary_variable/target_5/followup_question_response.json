The variable `p1` is not used in the `fn2` function and can be eliminated. This function always returns its first argument `p1`, but it has no side effects.\n\n```cpp\nsigned fn2(signed p1, signed p2) {\n  return p1;\n}\n```\n\n2. In the `fn4` function, the variable `p1` is used to calculate the remainder `p1 % p2`.
