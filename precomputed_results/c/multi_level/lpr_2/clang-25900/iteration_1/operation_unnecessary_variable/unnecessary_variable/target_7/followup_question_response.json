The variable `s` has the constant value -5.\n2. In the expression `~s`, `~` is the bitwise NOT operator, so `~(-5)` evaluates to 4 since the two's complement representation of -5 is 11111111...11111100, and flipping the bits results in 00000000...00000100 which is 4.\n3. The expression `t % (~s / ae)` involves division and modulo operations. Since `s` is a constant and `ae` is assigned to the value of `ad.o`, we need to ensure `ad.o` always has a non-zero value to avoid division by zero errors.\n4.
