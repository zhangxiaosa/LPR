Initialize the variable `ad` as a struct of type `m` with an initial value of `{1957}`.\n2. Assign the return value of `fn1(v, 5)` to the `o` field of `ad`. Since `fn1()` returns `p2` and we're passing `5` as the second argument, `ad.o` becomes `5`.\n3. Declare a variable `ae` of type `signed` without initializing it.\n4. Assign the value of `ad.o` (which is `5`) to `ae`. Now `ae` becomes `5`.\n5. Assign the value of `u` to `ad.o`. This overwrites the previous value of `ad.o` (which is `5`) with the current value of `u`.\n6. Calculate `r` by performing the following operations:\n   - Get the bitwise complement of `s` (`~s`), which is `~(-5L)`.\n   - Divide the result from the previous step by `ae` (`~s / ae`).\n   - Calculate the remainder of dividing `af` by the result of the previous step (`af % (~s / ae)`). Assign this value to `r`.\n7. The value of `ad.o` is accessed but not used or assigned to any variable. We can optimize it out since it has no effect on the program's behavior.\n\nFinally, we have optimized out the variable `ad`.

The target variable to be optimized is `ad` of type `struct m`.\n\n2. In the function `fn4()`, `ad` is initialized using the partial initializer `{1957}`. The field `o` is set to `fn1(v, 5)`. Since `ad.o` is assigned a function call result and the value of `ad` is not used subsequently, the assignment to `ad.o` can be optimized out.\n\n3. The next relevant statement is `ae = ad.o`. Since `ad.o` was optimized out in the previous step, `ae` can be assigned the initial value of `ad.o`, which is 0.\n\n4. The statement `ad.o = u` assigns the value of `u` to `ad.o`. Since the value of `ad` is not used subsequently, this assignment can be optimized out.\n\n5. The statement `r = af % (~s / ae)` assigns the value of the modulo operation to `r`. It involves the calculation `(~s / ae)`. The value of `s` is -5, so `~s` will be calculated as `4`, and the division `4 / ae` will be performed. Since `ae` always holds the value 0 (optimized in step 3), the division is undefined. Therefore, this calculation can be optimized out, and `r` will be left uninitialized.\n\n6. The last statement `ad.o` does nothing and can be removed.\n\n7. The function `fn4()` does not have a return statement, but its return type is `long`.
