Here is the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. The target function to be optimized is `fn2`.\n\n2. We need to identify all the function calls to `fn2` and replace them with the code of the function.\n\n3. In the main function, there is a call to `fn4`, which internally calls `fn2`. So we need to replace the call to `fn2` inside `fn4` with its code.\n\n4. The code of `fn2` only contains a call to `fn3`. Therefore, we also need to inline `fn3` into the code of `fn2`.\n\n5. `fn4` initializes a local variable `z` of type `struct m` and then calls `fn2`. We need to pass the values of the local variable `z` as arguments to the inlined `fn2`.\n\n6. `fn2` takes five arguments: `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `p4`, and `p5`. We need to replace the function call with the code from `fn2` and replace the formal parameters with their corresponding values.\n\n7. `fn3` is called inside `fn2`, and we need to inline `fn3` as well. `fn3` takes one argument `p1`.\n\n8. Replace the function call to `fn3` with its code and replace the formal parameter with its actual value.\n\n9. The inlined `fn3` assigns a value to a local variable `ad.o`. We need to replace the variable with its value.\n\n10. Once all the function calls have been replaced with the actual code, we can remove the original `fn2` and `fn3` functions.\n\n11. Clean up any unused variables or code snippets.\n\nAfter performing these optimizations, the resulting program will consist of the modified code.
