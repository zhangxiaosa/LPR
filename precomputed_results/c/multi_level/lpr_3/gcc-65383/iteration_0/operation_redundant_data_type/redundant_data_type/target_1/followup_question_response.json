The function `fn2()` is defined, which returns a value of type `d`.\n   - Inside the function, a variable `q` is declared as type `c`.\n   - A multidimensional array `r` is declared as type `int`.\n   - An if statement checks the value of `h[2]`.\n   - The value of `q` is returned if `h[2]` evaluates to true.\n   - Otherwise, the variable `g` is assigned a value from the multidimensional array `r`.\n\n4.
