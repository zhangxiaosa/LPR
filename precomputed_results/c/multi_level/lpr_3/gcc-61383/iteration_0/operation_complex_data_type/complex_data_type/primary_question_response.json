The program defines three functions: `fn1`, `fn2`, and `fn3`.\n2. The variables `p1` and `p2` inside `fn1` have data type `signed`.\n3. The variables `p1` and `p2` inside `fn2` have data type `short` and `int`, respectively.\n4. The variables `p1` and `p2` inside `fn3` have data type `int`.\n5.

The program includes a `main` function.\n   - Inside the `main` function, a local variable `ab` is declared with data type `int`.\n   - The control flow includes several conditional statements that don't declare new variables.\n7.
