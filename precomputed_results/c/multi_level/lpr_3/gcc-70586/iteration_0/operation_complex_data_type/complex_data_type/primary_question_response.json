The program defines a variable `i` of type `int` in the global scope.\n2. The program defines a function `fn3` with a parameter `p1`, which is not explicitly declared with a data type.\n3. Inside `fn3`, a variable `l` of type `int` is declared.\n4. Another variable `m` of type `short` is declared and assigned the value `0x809C`.\n5. There is an `if` statement that checks the value of the global variable `i` and prints the value of `l` using `printf`.\n6. Another variable `o` of type `int` is declared and assigned the value `0xE576516E`.\n7. There is another `if` statement that checks the value of `i` and prints the value of `l` using `printf`.\n8. A calculation is performed where `p1` is assigned the result of an expression involving bitwise XOR and subtraction operations.\n9. The function `fn3` returns the value of `p1` of type `short`.\n10. The program defines a function `fn4` with no parameters.\n11. Inside `fn4`, there is an `if` statement that calls the `fn3` function with the argument `1` and performs an empty statement if the result is true.\n12. The `main` function is defined, which has a return type of `int`.\n13. Inside `main`, the `fn4` function is called.\n14.
