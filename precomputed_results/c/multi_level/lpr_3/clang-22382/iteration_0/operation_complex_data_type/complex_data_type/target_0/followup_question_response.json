Define the variable `l` of type `unsigned`.\n\n3.

Inside the function `fn1`, the member `p5.k` of the structure `p5` is being accessed.\n\n5. Define the function `fn2` with the following parameter and return type:\n   - Parameters: `p1`.\n   - Return type: `unsigned`.\n\n6. Inside the function `fn2`, define the local variables `p` of type `struct h` and `q` of type `int`. Also, call the function `fn1` with the arguments `q`, `l`, `p1`, `3`, and `p`.\n\n7.
