Inside `fn1`, the value of `p5.k` (which is equivalent to `p.k`) is assigned to the local variable `p5_k`.\n4. There is an infinite loop labeled `w` using the `goto` statement.\n5. There is another infinite loop in `fn2` using a `for` loop.\n6. Inside the `for` loop, two variables of type `struct h`, `p` and `r`, are declared and assigned to each other (`p = r = p`).\n7. The value of `r` is not used afterward.\n8. The program ends.\n\nGiven the analysis, it is clear that the variable `p` is not used after it is assigned within the `for` loop.

Therefore, we can optimize `p` out by copy propagation.\n\n2. In `fn1`, the statement `unsigned p5_k = p5.k;` assigns the value of `p5.k` to the variable `p5_k`.

Since `fn1` does not modify `p`, we can propagate the value of `p` directly into the call to `fn1`.\n\nStep 2: Copy Propagation\nAfter the constant propagation, the value of `p` passed to `fn1` is the same as the value of `r` assigned inside the loop. Therefore, we can perform copy propagation and replace all the uses of `p` after the assignment `p = r` with `r`.\n\nStep 3: Remove Unused Variable\nFinally, we observe that the variable `p` is not used anywhere after the optimizations.
