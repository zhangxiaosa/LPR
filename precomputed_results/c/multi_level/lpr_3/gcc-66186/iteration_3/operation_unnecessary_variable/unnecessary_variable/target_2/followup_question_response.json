The variable `p1` is only passed as an argument to the function `fn4()`. It is not used inside the function itself.\n2. Since `p1` is not used within `fn4()`, it can be safely optimized out inside the function.\n3. In the `main()` function, the value of `g` is passed as an argument for `p1` in the `fn4()` function call. Since `g` is a global variable and not modified before the function call, we can safely assume that its value remains the same.\n4. Therefore, the function call `fn4(g, g, 1525311636, g)` can be replaced with `fn4(0, g, 1525311636, g)` to optimize out the unused `p1` argument.\n5.
