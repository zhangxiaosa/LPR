Loop unrolling is a technique where multiple iterations of a loop are merged to reduce the number of loop iterations and improve performance. A common unrolling factor is 2, so we will unroll the loop by a factor of 2 in this case.\n\nHere's the step-by-step analysis and modification of the program:\n\n1. In the `fn4` function:\n   - Remove the loop starting from `for (p2 = 0; p2 <= 7; p2 += 1)` since we are optimizing it out.\n   - Replace all occurrences of `p2` inside the loop with the constant value `7`.\n   - Similarly, replace all occurrences of `ak[p2]` with `ak[7]`.\n   - Remove the second nested loop (`for (p4 = 0; p4 <= 7; p4 += 1)`) since it depends on the outer loop that is being optimized out.\n\n   The modified `fn4` function will look like this:\n   ```c\n   f fn4(c p1, e p3, f p4, e p5) {\n     b ak[8];\n     if (h < 0)\n       if (ak[p3])\n         break;\n     return g;\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. In the `fn5` function:\n   - Modify the loop condition to `for (; p2 <= 5; p2 += 2)` to account for the loop unrolling by a factor of 2.\n   - Remove the if statement inside the loop since it becomes unreachable.\n   - Update the parameters passed to `fn4` to match the modified function signature.\n\n   The modified `fn5` function will look like this:\n   ```c\n   c fn5() {\n     a ae = 0xA3L;\n     c p1 = 0x9A5DL;\n     c p2 = g;\n     c p3 = 0x57638FF4L;\n     e p4 = 0x30A04A8FL;\n     c p5 = g;\n     for (; p2 <= 5; p2 += 2)\n       fn4(p1, p3, p4, p5);\n     return ae;\n   }\n   ```\n\n3.
