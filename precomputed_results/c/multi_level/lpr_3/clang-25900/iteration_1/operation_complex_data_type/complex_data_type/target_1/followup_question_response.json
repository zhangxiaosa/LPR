Analyze the program's execution flow:\n   - The function `fn1` takes two `unsigned` integers, `p1` and `p2`, as input parameters and returns `p2` as an `unsigned` integer.\n   - In the `main` function:\n     - A structure variable `ad` of type `m` is declared and initialized with the value `1957` for the `n` member.\n     - The `o` member of `ad` is assigned the result of calling `fn1` with arguments `5` and `5`.\n     - A `signed` integer variable `ae` is declared and assigned the value of `ad.o`.\n     - The `o` member of `ad` is then assigned the variable `u`.\n     - The `r` variable is assigned the result of the expression `t % (~s / ae)`.\n     - The expression `ad.o` does not have any effect.\n\n3.
