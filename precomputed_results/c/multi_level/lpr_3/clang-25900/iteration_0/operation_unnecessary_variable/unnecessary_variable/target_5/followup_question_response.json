Since `p2` is a parameter of the function `fn1`, we need to analyze all the calls to `fn1` and see if `p2` is a constant. If it is a constant, we can replace the calls with the constant value.\n\nHere is the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. The function `fn1` takes two parameters, `p1` and `p2`, and returns `p2`. It is defined as:\n\n```c\nunsigned fn1(unsigned p1, int p2) {\n  return p2;\n}\n```\n\n2. In the `main` function, the variable `ad.o` is assigned the return value of the call to `fn1` with arguments `v` and `5`:\n\n```c\nad.o = fn1(v, 5);\n```\n\n3. Since `p2` is the second parameter of `fn1`, we can replace the call `fn1(v, 5)` with `5` since `p2` is a constant:\n\n```c\nad.o = 5;\n```\n\n4. The variable `ae` is declared as `signed`:\n\n```c\nsigned ae;\n```\n\n5. The variable `af` is assigned the value of `t`:\n\n```c\nint af = t;\n```\n\n6. The value of `ad.o` is assigned to `ae`:\n\n```c\nae = ad.o;\n```\n\n7. The value of `u` is assigned to `ad.o`:\n\n```c\nad.o = u;\n```\n\n8. The value of `af` modulo the division of the bitwise complement of `s` by `ae` is assigned to `r`:\n\n```c\nr = af % (~s / ae);\n```\n\n9. The value of `ad.o` is left unused:\n\n```c\nad.o;\n```\n\nBased on the analysis, the variable `p2` can be optimized out by replacing the call `fn1(v, 5)` with `5`.
