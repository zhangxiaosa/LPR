We are given the target variable `af` that we need to optimize out by constant propagation or copy propagation.\n2. We'll start by analyzing the program and identifying all the places where the value of `af` is used or assigned.\n3. The initial value of `af` is `t`, so we need to determine if `t` changes its value before being used with `r = af % (~s / ae)`. It does not change its value, so we can propagate the constant `t` wherever `af` is used.\n4. The statement `ae = ad.o` assigns the value of `ad.o` to `ae`. We need to check if `ad.o` changes its value before `ae` is used with `r = af % (~s / ae)`. Since `ad.o` is not modified after this statement, we can replace `ae` with the constant `ad.o`.\n5. The statement `r = af % (~s / ae)` uses `af` and `ae` to compute `r`. We have already determined that `af` can be replaced with the constant `t`. We also need to check if `ae` changes its value before this statement. Since `ae` is not modified after the previous assignment, we can replace `ae` with the constant `ad.o`.\n6. Finally, we can replace `af` in `r = af % (~s / ae)` with `t`, and `ae` with `ad.o`, resulting in `r = t % (~s / ad.o)`.\n7.
