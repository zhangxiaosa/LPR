Analyze the target code to understand its purpose and dependencies.\n2. Determine the loop that can be unrolled.\n3. Rewrite the loop by manually unrolling it.\n4. Update the program code with the optimized version by replacing the loop with the unrolled version.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to optimize the given target code:\n\n1. The target code `if (fn2(0))` calls the function `fn2` with argument `0` and checks if the result is true (non-zero). The function `fn2` returns different values based on the values of `i`, `h`, `g`, and `j_old`. To optimize this target code, we need to analyze the conditions and expressions inside the function `fn2` as well.\n\n2. There is no explicit loop in the given target code. However, the function `fn2` contains two conditional statements that can be considered for loop unrolling. The first conditional statement `if (i == 1)` can be unrolled if `i` is a loop variable.\n   \n3. Since `i` is not explicitly assigned or modified in the code, it is unclear if it serves as a loop variable. Therefore, we cannot unroll the first conditional statement at this point.\n\n4.
