Loop unrolling is a technique in which multiple loop iterations are combined into a single iteration, reducing the overhead of loop control and improving performance. The specific optimization steps for loop unrolling are as follows:\n\n1. Determine the number of loop iterations to unroll. In this case, we need to decide how many iterations to combine into a single iteration. The optimal unrolling factor depends on factors such as the size of the loop body, performance considerations, and target architecture.\n\n2. Rewrite the loop body to incorporate the unrolling factor. In each unrolled iteration, the loop body will be executed once, but the loop control variable (`p1` in this case) needs to be updated accordingly.\n\n3. Handle any remaining iterations if the total number of iterations is not divisible by the unrolling factor. This could involve executing the leftover iterations separately or modifying the loop body to handle the remaining iterations.\n\n4. Update the loop termination condition to reflect the changes made in the loop body.\n\nNow let's apply these optimization steps to the given program:\n\n```c\nunsigned fn2(p1) {\n  unsigned v[6][3][2];\n  for (i = 0;;) {\n    if (k)\n      break;\n    return v[g][l + 1][l];\n  }\n  if (h)\n    ;\n  else\n    return j_new[g][g];\n  for (; p1;) {\n  }\n  return 0x709BFC8A;\n}\n```\n\nTarget loop: `for (; p1;) {`\n\nBased on the information provided, it is unclear what the initial value of `p1` is or how it is updated within the loop.

The loop is an infinite loop with no statements inside it. It seems that the loop is used to wait until `p1` becomes zero. To optimize this loop, we can replace it with a `while` loop that explicitly checks the condition at the beginning.
