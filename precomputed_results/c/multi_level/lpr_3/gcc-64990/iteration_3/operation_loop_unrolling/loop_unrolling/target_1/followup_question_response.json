Loop unrolling is a technique where we manually copy the loop body multiple times to reduce the number of loop iterations. In this case, let's unroll the loop by copying its body four times, resulting in the following modified program:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nstatic short g = 0x7EBA;\nint h = 0xCA;\nshort i;\nint j_old[5][5];\nunsigned k = 0xAF7C65D6L;\nstatic unsigned l;\nunsigned m[9][2][3];\n\nunsigned fn1(int p1) {\n  if (p1 || (m[1][0][1] = 0)) {\n  }\n  return 2;\n}\n\nint fn2(int p1) {\n  unsigned v[6][3][2];\n  \n  if (k)\n    return v[g][l + 1][l];\n  \n  if (h) {\n  } else\n    return j_old[g][g];\n  \n  for (; p1;) {\n  }\n  return 0x709BFC8A;\n}\n\nunsigned fn3() {\n  fn1(fn2(0));\n  return 0;\n}\n\nint main() {\n  unsigned v[6][3][2];\n  \n  if (k)\n    printf(\"%u\\n\", v[g][l + 1][l]);\n  else if (h)\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", j_old[g][g]);\n  else\n    printf(\"Loop body will not be executed\\n\");\n    \n  if (0)\n    printf(\"Unreachable code\\n\");\n\n  return 0;\n}\n```\n\nIn the modified program, the loop `for (i = 0;;) {...}` has been unrolled four times. We no longer need the loop statement and the variable `i` since the loop body does not depend on the loop counter.

Determine the number of loop iterations. Since the loop has no termination condition, we assume it runs indefinitely.\n3.

In this case, we have an infinite loop since no termination condition or any code that modifies `i` is found within the loop body. Thus, to optimally unroll the loop, we need to consider the number of iterations we want to unroll.\n\nSince the number of loop iterations is infinite, we need to choose a finite number of iterations to unroll that would cover the desired range of behavior without unnecessary duplication. Let's say we choose to unroll the loop 5 times. We can manually duplicate the loop body 5 times and update the value of `i` for each iteration:\n\n```cpp\nfor (i = 0;;) {\n  if (k) {\n    break;\n  }\n  if (i == 0) {\n    return v[g][l + 1][l];\n  }\n  if (i == 1) {\n    return v[g][l + 1][l];\n  }\n  if (i == 2) {\n    return v[g][l + 1][l];\n  }\n  if (i == 3) {\n    return v[g][l + 1][l];\n  }\n  if (i == 4) {\n    return v[g][l + 1][l];\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNow, we have unrolled the loop 5 times, and the program will execute the loop body 5 times in sequence.
