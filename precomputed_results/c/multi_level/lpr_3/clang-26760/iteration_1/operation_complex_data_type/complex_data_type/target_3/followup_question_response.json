The typedef `signed a` is equivalent to `int a` because `int` is a signed integer data type.\n2. The `typedef int c` remains unchanged as it is already a primary data type.\n3. The `typedef unsigned d` becomes `unsigned int d` as `unsigned int` is the primary data type for unsigned integers.\n4. The `typedef unsigned e` becomes `unsigned int e` for the same reason as above.\n5. `d f;` is already a primary data type variable (`unsigned int`).\n6. `a g;` becomes `int g` as `a` is equivalent to `int`.\n7. In the `main` function, `a i;` remains unchanged as `i` is already declared as `int`.\n8. `c j = 0x24F96B7BL;` becomes `int j = 0x24F96B7B;` as `c` is equivalent to `int` and hex literal doesn't require the `L` suffix.\n9. `e k;` is already a primary data type variable (`unsigned int`).\n10. In the `for` loop, `f = 0;` remains unchanged as `f` is already declared as `unsigned int`.\n11. `--j;` remains unchanged as `j` is already declared as `int`.\n12. `c l = 1L;` becomes `int l = 1;` as `c` is equivalent to `int` and the `L` suffix is not required for `1`.\n13. `c m = j;` remains unchanged as `m` is already declared as `int` and `j` is an `int` variable.\n14. `a n = g;` remains unchanged as `n` is already declared as `int` and `g` is an `int` variable.\n15. `c o = n;` remains unchanged as `o` is already declared as `int` and `n` is an `int` variable.\n16. `e p = o;` remains unchanged as `p` is already declared as `unsigned int` and `o` is an `int` variable.\n17. Inside the `while` loop, `k = k >> l;` remains unchanged as both `k` and `l` are already declared as `unsigned int`.\n18. `i = p;` remains unchanged as `i` is already declared as `int` and `p` is an `unsigned int` variable.\n19. Inside the `if` condition, `k = k << m;` remains unchanged as both `k` and `m` are already declared as `unsigned int`.\n20. The `goto` statement remains unchanged.\n21.
