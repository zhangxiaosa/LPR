Inside the loop, there's a condition using a function call `fn7` with constant parameters (`4UL` and `fn6(aq, fn5(ai, au_0[4][1][5] = fn8(~fn4(fn3(0, fn2(ap, 1L)) != 0, an), ak) && 0x57L))`).\n4. Since the constant propagation technique involves replacing the variable `al` with its computed constant value, we need to analyze whether the expression used as a parameter in `fn7` always results in the same constant value for `al`.\n5. The expression `(fn6(aq, fn5(ai, au_0[4][1][5] = fn8(~fn4(fn3(0, fn2(ap, 1L)) != 0, an), ak) && 0x57L))) > 2` will produce different values for different iterations of the loop because it depends on the loop variables `ai`, `aq`, `an`, and `ak`.\n6.
