Here is the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. The variable `ao` is initialized with the value `0xBCD1L`.\n2. In the `if` statement, `an = 250UL` is assigned, but it has no impact on the value of `ao`.\n3. The function `fn6` is called with arguments `1L` and `an`. The result is subtracted from `0xECL` and the final result is subtracted from `ao`. Since `fn6` is not provided, we cannot determine the constant result of this expression.\n4. The subtraction result is compared with `p2` and with `1UL`. If the conditions are true, `v` is assigned the value `1UL`. Again, we cannot determine the constants involved in this comparison.\n5. The loop repeats until `w` becomes `0`.\n6. After the loop, a value `0x2F2F6D26L` is returned from the `fn13` function.\n7. In `main`, `fn13` is called, and the returned value is discarded.\n8. `p` is assigned the value of `v`.\n9. The value of `p` is printed using `printf` with the format \"checksum = %X\".\n\nSince we cannot determine the constants involved in the crucial parts of the program that affect the value of `ao`, we cannot optimize out the variable `ao` through constant propagation.
