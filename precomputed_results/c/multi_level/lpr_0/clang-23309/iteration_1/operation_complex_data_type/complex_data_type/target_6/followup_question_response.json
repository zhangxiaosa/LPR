Based on the provided code, here is the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. The program declares the following variables:\n   - `unsigned p;` (primary data type: unsigned)\n   - `long v;` (primary data type: long)\n   - `short w;` (primary data type: short)\n   - `short ac = 1L;` (primary data type: short)\n\n2. The program defines a function `fn6` that takes two parameters of type `unsigned` and returns an `unsigned` value. The function is not used in the main program but is defined for optimization purposes. The primary data types used are `unsigned`.\n\n3. The program defines a function `fn13` that returns an `int` value. Inside this function, the following variables are declared:\n   - `int af = 0x2F2F6D26L;` (primary data type: int)\n   - `long am = 1L;` (primary data type: long)\n   - `int an;` (primary data type: int)\n   - `unsigned p2 = ac || (an = w) == 0x294A85636008822DLL;` (primary data type: unsigned)\n   - `short ao = 0xBCD1L;` (primary data type: short)\n\n4.

Inside the loop, an if condition is checked: `if (an = 250UL)`. The variable `an` is assigned a value of `250UL` (primary data type: int).\n\n6.
