The function `fn13` contains a loop that iterates three times.\n2. Inside the loop, there is an if statement `if (an = 250UL)`, which assigns 250 to the variable `an`.\n3. The variable `p2` is assigned the result of the expression `ac || (an = w) == 0x294A85636008822DLL`.\n4. The variable `ao` is assigned the value `0xBCD1L`.\n5. There is an if statement with a condition `(ao - (fn6(am, an) - 0xECL)) - p2 & 1UL`.\n6. Inside the if statement, the variable `v` is assigned the value `1UL`.\n7. After the loop, the value of `af` is returned by the `fn13` function.\n8. In the `main` function, `fn13` is called.\n9. The value of `v` is assigned to `p`.\n10.
