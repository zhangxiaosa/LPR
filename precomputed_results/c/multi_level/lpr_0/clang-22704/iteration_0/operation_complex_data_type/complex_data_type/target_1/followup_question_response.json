The program contains a function `fn1()` that returns a `char` type.\n   \n   ```c++\n   char fn1() { ... }\n   ```\n\n3. Inside the `fn1()` function, there is a local variable `h` of type `int` initialized with the value `6L`.\n   \n   ```c++\n   int h = 6L;\n   ```\n\n4. The function checks the value of the global variable `f_e` in an `if` condition. If `f_e` evaluates to true, it jumps to a label `i`.\n   \n   ```c++\n   if (f_e)\n     goto i;\n   ```\n\n5.
