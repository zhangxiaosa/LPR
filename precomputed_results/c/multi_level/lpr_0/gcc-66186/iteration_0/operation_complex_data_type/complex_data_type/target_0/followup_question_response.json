The program starts by declaring global variables `g` and `h`, both of type `int`.\n2. Five function prototypes are declared: `fn1`, `fn2`, `fn3`, `fn4`, and `fn5`. These functions have different return types and parameters.\n3. The `fn5` function is defined. It initializes two local variables, `n` and `o`, of types `int` and `unsigned`, respectively. Then it calls `fn1` with the values of `n`, `g`, and `g` as arguments. Finally, it returns the value of `o`.\n4. The `fn1` function is defined.

The `fn2` function is defined. It initializes a local variable `u` of type `unsigned`. It then checks the result of calling `fn3` with specific arguments. If the result is non-zero, it returns 0.\n6. The `fn3` function is defined. It initializes two local variables, `ad` and `ae`, of type `int`. It then checks the result of calling `fn4` with specific arguments.
