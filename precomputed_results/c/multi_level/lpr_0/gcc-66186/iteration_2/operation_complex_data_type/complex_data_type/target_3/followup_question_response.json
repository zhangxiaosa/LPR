Since the target to be optimized is `p4`, we need to analyze the program's logic to determine the optimization strategy.\n\n   - As the loop condition for `p4` is just a counter (`p4 <= 7`), and it is incremented by `1` in each iteration, we can optimize the loop by changing it to a single assignment with the value `7` (the loop will only run once).\n\n8.
