In the provided program, \"fn2\" is the only function that references the variable \"d\". It returns a value of type \"d\" by calling a function named \"fn1\".\n\n3. However, the function \"fn1\" does not return any value, so the expression \"{fn1}\" in \"fn2\" is invalid. We can remove this expression.\n\n4. After removing the invalid expression \"{fn1}\", the \"fn2\" function becomes an empty function.\n\n5.
