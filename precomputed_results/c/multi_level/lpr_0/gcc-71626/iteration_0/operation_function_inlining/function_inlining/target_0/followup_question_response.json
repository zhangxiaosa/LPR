Here's the step-by-step analysis of the program:\n\n1. The program starts with a typedef declaration `typedef long a;`, which defines the type `a` as `long`.\n\n2. The next line defines the function `fn1()` with an empty body `fn1() {}`. This is the function we're going to inline.\n\n3. Another typedef declaration follows: `typedef a d __attribute__((__vector_size__(sizeof(a))));`. It defines the type `d` as a vector of `a` elements, with a size equal to the size of `a` type (which is `long`).\n\n4. The function `fn2()` is defined next, which returns a variable of type `d`. Inside this function, there are the following steps:\n   - Variable `c` of type `a` is declared and assigned the value of the function pointer `fn1`.\n   - Variable `f` of type `d` is declared and initialized with the value of `c`.\n   - Finally, the `f` variable is returned.\n\n5.
