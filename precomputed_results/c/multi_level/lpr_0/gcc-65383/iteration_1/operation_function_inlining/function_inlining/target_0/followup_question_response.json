In this case, the contents of `fn2` are enclosed in a loop with an `if` statement and an assignment to the variable `g`.\n\n```cpp\nunsigned g;\nint h2 = 2453134317;\nstatic unsigned i = 175;\nunsigned fn2() {\n  int r[5][9][5];\n  if (h2)\n    return 195;\n  g = r[i][i][i];\n}\n```\n\n2.

Optimize further if possible. Since the program is stripped down to its essential code, there are no further optimizations to apply.\n\nThe final optimized program is as follows:\n\n```cpp\nunsigned g;\nint main() {\n  int r[5][9][5];\n  g = r[i][i][i];\n}\n```\n\nI will now write the final optimized program into a JSON file."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}, {"index": 1, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To optimize the program by function inlining, we can replace all the function calls to `fn2()` with the actual code of the function itself.
