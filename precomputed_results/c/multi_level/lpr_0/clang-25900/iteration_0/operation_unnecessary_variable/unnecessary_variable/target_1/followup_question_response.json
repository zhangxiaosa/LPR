We start by identifying the variable `ae` which is the target for optimization.\n\n2. Looking at the code inside the `fn4` function, we can see that `ae` is assigned the value of `ad.o` on the line `ae = ad.o;`.\n\n3. The value of `ad.o` is assigned the return value of the `fn1` function with arguments `5` and `5`. Since the function `fn1` simply returns its second argument `p2`, we can replace `ad.o` with `5`.\n\n4. Therefore, we can optimize the code by replacing the assignment `ae = ad.o;` with `ae = 5;`.\n\n5. The optimized version of the `fn4` function becomes:\n\n```cpp\nint fn4() {\n  struct m ad = {1957};\n  ad.o = fn1(5, 5);\n  int ae;\n  int af = t;\n  ae = 5;  // Optimized assignment\n  ad.o = u;\n  r = af % (~s / ae);\n  ad.o;\n}\n```\n\n6. Since `ae` is not used in any other part of the code, it can be considered unused. Therefore, we can further optimize the code by removing the declaration and assignment of `ae` altogether.\n\n7. The final optimized version of the `fn4` function becomes:\n\n```cpp\nint fn4() {\n  struct m ad = {1957};\n  ad.o = fn1(5, 5);\n  int af = t;\n  ad.o = u;\n  r = af % (~s / 5);\n  ad.o;\n}\n```\n\n8.
