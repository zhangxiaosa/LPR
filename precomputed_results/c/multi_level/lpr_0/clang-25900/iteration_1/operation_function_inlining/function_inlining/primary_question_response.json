The program begins by declaring variables `r`, `s`, `t`, and `u` of different types.\n2. Next, a function `fn1` is defined, which takes a parameter `p2` and returns it.\n3. Then, a struct `m` is defined, which has two members `n` and `o` of type `int`.\n4. The `fn4` function is defined, which does the following:\n   - Declares a struct variable `ad` of type `m` and initializes its member `n` with the value 1957.\n   - Assigns the result of `fn1(5)` to the member `o` of `ad`.\n   - Declares a variable `ae` and assigns the value of `ad.o` to it.\n   - Assigns the value of `u` to the member `o` of `ad`.\n   - Calculates `r` as `t % (~s / ae)` and assigns the result to `r`.\n   - Evaluates `ad.o`.\n5.
