To optimize the program, we need to eliminate the usage of `struct m` and substitute every instance of it with its associated original data type, which is a combination of multiple `int` fields.\n\nHere's the step-by-step analysis and modification of the program:\n\n1. Identify the fields in `struct m` and their corresponding data types:\n   - Field `n` has a data type of `int`.\n   - Field `o` has a data type of `int`.\n\n2. Replace every instance of `struct m` and its fields with their associated original data types:\n   - Replace `struct m` with `int`.\n   - Replace `ad.n` with `ad_n`.\n   - Replace `ad.o` with `ad_o`.\n\n3. Update the function `fn4()` accordingly:\n   - Update the declaration of `ad`:\n     - Change `struct m ad` to `int ad_n, ad_o`.\n     - Initialize `ad_n` with the value `1957`.\n\n   - Update the assignment of `ad.o` using the function `fn1()`:\n     - Change `ad.o = fn1(5)` to `ad_o = fn1(5)`.\n\n   - Update the assignment of `ae`:\n     - Change `int ae` to `int ae = ad_o`.\n\n   - Update the assignment of `r`:\n     - Change `r = t % (~s / ae)` to `r = t % (~s / ae)`.\n\n   - Remove the line `ad.o;` as it doesn't have any effect.\n\n4.
