Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program and how to perform function inlining:\n\n1. The program defines a typedef `a` as a signed integer and typedef `b` as an integer.\n\n2. It declares a struct `c` with the following members:\n   - `signed d` as a signed integer with 18 bits\n   - `unsigned e` as an unsigned integer\n   - `unsigned f` as an unsigned integer\n   - `signed g` as a signed integer\n   - `signed h` as a signed integer\n\n3. It declares two instances of struct `c` named `i` and `j`.\n\n4. It defines the function `fn1` with the return type `b` (an integer).\n\n5. Inside `fn1`:\n   - It declares a local variable `l` of type struct `c` and initializes it with the values `{24, 6738, 165}`.\n   - It assigns the value of `j.e` to the member `l.d`.\n   - It declares a local variable `n` of type `b` and initializes it with the logical AND of `j.h` and `l.d`.\n   - It declares a local variable `o` of type `b` and initializes it with the value of `l.d`.\n   - It calculates the value of `p` by performing the following operations:\n     - Logical AND of `l.f` and `l.d`.\n     - Negation of the above result.\n     - Subtraction of `n` from the negated result.\n     - Bitwise OR of `o` and the result of the subtraction.\n   - It assigns the value of `p` to the member `i.g`.\n\n6. The program defines the `main` function with the return type `int`, which is currently empty.\n\nTo perform function inlining, we need to replace all the function calls to `fn1` with the actual code.
