Loop unrolling involves copying the loop body multiple times and eliminating the loop control mechanism.\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis and modification of the program:\n\n1. Remove the `goto w;` statement at label `w:` within the `fn1` function, as it creates an infinite loop.\n\n2. Remove the `for (;;) { ... }` loop in the `fn2` function, as it becomes unnecessary after the loop at label `w:` is optimized out.\n\n3.
