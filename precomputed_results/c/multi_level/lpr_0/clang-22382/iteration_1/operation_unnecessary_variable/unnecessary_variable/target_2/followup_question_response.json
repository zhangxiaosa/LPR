However, since `p2` is not used after this assignment, we can optimize it out by removing the unnecessary assignment. The optimized `fn2` function becomes:\n```cpp\nunsigned fn2() {\n  struct original_data_type p;\n  fn1(0, p);\n  for (;;) {\n    struct original_data_type r;\n    p = p;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nStep 3: Check for Usage in `main`\nSince the variable `p2` is not used in the `main` function, we can completely eliminate it.
