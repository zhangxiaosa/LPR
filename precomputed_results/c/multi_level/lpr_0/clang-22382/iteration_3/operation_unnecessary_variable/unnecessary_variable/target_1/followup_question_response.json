Start with the `main` function. Since it does not contain any relevant code, we can skip it.\n2. Analyze the `fn2` function:\n   a. In the `fn2` function, variable `p` of type `struct original_data_type` is initialized.\n   b. `fn1(0, p)` is called, passing the value of `p` as an argument. However, `j` is not used in `fn1`, so it does not affect the optimization. We can skip this.\n   c. Inside the `while (1)` loop, `struct original_data_type r` is declared and initialized with the value of `p`. Then, `r` is assigned to `p`.\n    \n      Since `j` is not used anywhere in the program, its value is never modified. Therefore, we can replace all occurrences of `j` with a constant. Let's replace `j` with `0`:\n      \n      ```c\n      unsigned fn2() {\n        struct original_data_type p;\n        fn1(0, p);\n        while (1) {\n          struct original_data_type r;\n          p = r = p;\n        }\n      }\n      ```\n\n3. Analyze the `fn1` function:\n   a. In `fn1`, the parameter `p5` of type `struct original_data_type` is defined, but `j` is not used. We can remove `p5.j`.\n   b. The function contains an infinite loop labeled `w`. Since `j` is not used, we can remove the loop entirely.\n    \n      The optimized `fn1` function becomes:\n      \n      ```c\n      static unsigned fn1(unsigned p1, struct original_data_type p5) {\n        p5.k;\n      }\n      ```\n\n4.

In `fn2`, the `fn1` function is called with `0` and a local variable `p` of type `original_data_type` as arguments. The return value of `fn1` is not used, so the invocation of `fn1` can be optimized by removing it.\n\n5. Inside the `while` loop in `fn2`, there are two statements:\n   - `struct original_data_type r;` declares a local variable `r` of type `original_data_type`.\n   - `p = r = p;` assigns the value of `p` to `r` and then assigns the value of `r` back to `p`.
