The `fn1` function is defined as a `static` function that takes two parameters: an `unsigned` integer `p1` and a `struct original_data_type` named `p5`. The function accesses the `k` member of `p5` but does not use the value. It then enters an infinite loop using `goto` statement.\n   ```c\n   static unsigned fn1(unsigned p1, struct original_data_type p5) {\n     p5.k;\n   w:\n     goto w;\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. The `fn2` function is defined as an `unsigned` function without parameters. It declares a local variable `p` of type `struct original_data_type` and invokes `fn1` function with arguments `0` and `p`. It then enters an infinite loop where it declares another local variable `r` of type `struct original_data_type` and assigns `p` to `r` and assigns `r` to `p`.\n   ```c\n   unsigned fn2() {\n     struct original_data_type p;\n     fn1(0, p);\n     while (1) {\n       struct original_data_type r;\n       p = r = p;\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n4.

The function does not perform any operations on the variable p1. It references the member k of the struct p5 but does not use it for any further operations.
