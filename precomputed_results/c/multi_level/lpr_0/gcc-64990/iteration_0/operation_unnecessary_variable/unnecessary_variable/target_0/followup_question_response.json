The target variable is \"n\". Let's analyze its usage:\n   - In the `fn3` function, the value of `n` is returned at the end of the function.\n   - The `main` function calls `fn3`.\n\n2. Since the variable `n` is not used for any other purpose in the program and its value is only returned at the end of `fn3`, we can optimize it out by removing it completely.\n\n3.
