The program defines the function `struct i fn2(int p1, struct i p2, unsigned p3, short p4)`.\n   - Variable `p1` has the data type `int`.\n   - Variable `p2` has the data type `struct i`.\n   - Variable `p3` has the data type `unsigned`.\n   - Variable `p4` has the data type `short`.\n   - Variable `v_j` has the data type `int`.\n   - Variable `w` has the data type `int`.\n   - Variable `a` has the data type `int`.\n\n6.

The function `fn2` returns a value of type `struct i`.\n\n8. The program defines the function `unsigned fn3(p1)`.\n   - Variable `p1` does not have an explicitly defined data type and should be assumed to be of an unspecified type.\n   - Variable `q` is a 2D array of `unsigned char` values.\n   - Variable `r` has the data type `struct i`.\n\n9. Inside the function `fn3`, there is an `if` statement with a call to `fn2`. The result of the `if` statement is unused.\n\n10. The function `fn3` returns a value of type `unsigned`.\n\n11.
