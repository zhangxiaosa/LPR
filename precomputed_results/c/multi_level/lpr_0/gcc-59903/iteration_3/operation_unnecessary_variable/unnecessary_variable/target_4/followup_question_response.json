Here is the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. We start analyzing the `fn2` function:\n   - The variable `w` is initialized but never assigned a new value, so it is always `0`.\n   - The `for` loop condition `w` is always `0`, so the loop will never execute.\n   - As a result, the `w` inside the loop will never be assigned a value.\n\n2. The `if` condition `p4 ^ -5L` in the `fn2` function is always false, so the `else` block is always executed. Therefore, `v_j` will be set to `0`.\n\n3. The `for` loop:\n   - Since `w` is `0`, the condition `w` is always false, and the loop will never execute.\n\n4. The call to `fn1` inside the loop has the arguments `n_0_l` and `2`. However, the value of `n_0_l` is not set anywhere in the provided code and remains uninitialized. Therefore, `fn1` cannot be called with a constant value as one of its arguments, and the code will not compile as presented.\n\n5.
