Identify the structure `struct i` with its members `int j`, `int k`, and `int l`. This is a redundant data type and will be included in the result.\n3. Identify the array `unsigned m[4]`. No redundant data types are found here.\n4. Identify the array of structures `struct i n[2]`. No redundant data types are found here.\n5. Identify the function `fn2` with its parameters `int p1`, `struct i p2`, `unsigned p3`, and `short p4`. No redundant data types are found here.\n6. Identify the local variable `int v_j` inside the function `fn2`. No redundant data types are found here.\n7. Identify the local variables `int w` and `int a` inside the function `fn2`. No redundant data types are found here.\n8. Identify the condition `if (p4 ^ -5L)` inside the function `fn2`. No redundant data types are found here.\n9. Identify the assignment `v_j = n[1].j` inside the function `fn2`. No redundant data types are found here.\n10. Identify the nested loops inside the function `fn2` and their variables: `w`, `p3`, and `p2.j`. No redundant data types are found here.\n11. Identify the assignments and conditions inside the nested loops. No redundant data types are found here.\n12. Identify the return type of the function `fn2`, which is `struct i`.

Identify the array `unsigned char q[7][7]` inside the function `fn3`. No redundant data types are found here.\n15. Identify the structure `struct i r` inside the function `fn3`. No redundant data types are found here.\n16. Identify the condition `if (fn2(p1, r, 0, q[0][0]), p1)` inside the function `fn3`. No redundant data types are found here.\n17. Identify the return type of the function `fn3`, which is `unsigned`. No redundant data types are found here.\n18. Identify the function `main()`. No redundant data types are found here.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only redundant data type found is `struct i`.
