The function `fn1(unsigned p1, int p2)` returns the maximum value between `p1` and `p1` left-shifted by `p2`.\n\n2. The program defines the following variables:\n   - `n_0_j`\n   - `n_0_l`\n   - `j`\n   - `k`\n   - `m[4]` (an array of unsigned integers)\n   - `struct i` (a structure containing `j` and `k` as int members)\n   - `v_j`, `w`, and `a` (temporary variables used in `fn2`)\n   - `q[7][7]` (a 2D array of unsigned chars)\n   - `r` (an instance of `struct i`)\n\n3. The function `fn2(int p1, struct i p2, unsigned p3, short p4)` performs a series of nested loops and conditions involving the variables declared in step 2.\n\n4. The function `fn3(int p1)` declares a 2D array `q` and an instance of `struct i` named `r`. It then calls `fn2` with `p1` and `r` as arguments.\n\n5.
