Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. Start by looking at the variable `n`, which is our target for optimization. It is declared as an array of structures of type `struct i`. We need to decompose `struct i` first.\n\n2. The structure `struct i` has three members: `j`, `k`, and `l`. `j` and `k` are of type `signed` and `l` is of type `int`.\n\n3. Replace `struct i` with its decomposed form:\n   - `signed j` becomes `int j`\n   - `signed k` becomes `int k`\n   - `int l` remains as it is\n\n   So the decomposed structure `struct i` becomes:\n   ```\n   struct i {\n     int j;\n     int k;\n     int l;\n   };\n   ```\n\n4. Now, let's replace the variable `n` with its decomposed form:\n   - `struct i n[2]` becomes `int n_j[2]`, `int n_k[2]`, and `int n_l[2]`\n\n   So the decomposed variable `n` becomes:\n   ```\n   int n_j[2];\n   int n_k[2];\n   int n_l[2];\n   ```\n\n5.
