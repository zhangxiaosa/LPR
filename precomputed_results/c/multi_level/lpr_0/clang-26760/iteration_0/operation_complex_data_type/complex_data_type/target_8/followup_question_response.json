Here is the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. Complex data types used in the program:\n   - `typedef signed int a;` -> `a` is a signed integer.\n   - `typedef int c;` -> `c` is an integer.\n   - `typedef unsigned int d;` -> `d` is an unsigned integer.\n   - `typedef unsigned int e;` -> `e` is an unsigned integer.\n\n2. Replace complex data types with primary data types:\n   - Replace `a` with `signed int`.\n   - Replace `c` with `int`.\n   - Replace `d` with `unsigned int`.\n   - Replace `e` with `unsigned int`.\n\n3. Primary data type variables:\n   - `d f;` -> `unsigned int f;`\n   - `a g;` -> `signed int g;`\n   - `a i;` -> `signed int i;`\n   - `c j = 0x24F96B7BL;` -> `int j = 0x24F96B7BL;`\n   - `e k;` -> `unsigned int k;`\n   - `c l = 1L;` -> `int l = 1L;`\n   - `c m = j;` -> `int m = j;`\n   - `a n = g;` -> `signed int n = g;`\n\n4. Perform code optimization:\n   - The `for` loop `for (f = 0; ; )` has an empty condition, which means it will run indefinitely. To optimize it, we can remove the loop since `f` is not used in the loop.\n   - The inner `for` loop `for (; j; --j)` doesn't have any statements inside. It can be removed as well.\n\n5.
