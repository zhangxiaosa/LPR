Identify the relevant function: The `fn1` function declaration and definition will be analyzed first since it includes the target variable `p1`.\n\n2. Analyze the function parameters: The parameters of `fn1` are `p1` of type `int`, `p2` of type `short`, `p3` of type `int`, and `p4` of type `int`.\n\n3. Analyze the local variables inside `fn1`:\n   - `m[1][0][1]`: This is a 3-dimensional array of type `unsigned`. We'll need to decompose it into separate variables of primary data types.\n  \n4. Decompose Complex Data Types:\n   - Since `m[1][0][1]` is a 3-dimensional array of type `unsigned`, we'll need to decompose it into separate variables of primary data types. Let's assume the dimensions are `M`, `N`, and `O`.\n\n     `m[1][0][1]` will be broken down into the following variables:\n     - `m_0_1_1`\n     \n5.
