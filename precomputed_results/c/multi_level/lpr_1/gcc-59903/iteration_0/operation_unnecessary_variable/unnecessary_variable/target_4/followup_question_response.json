The variable `p1` is used as a parameter in the function `fn1(d p1, int32_t p2)`. Inside the function, it is used in a conditional statement `return p1 ? p1 : p2`. The optimization depends on whether the variable `p1` is constant or not. If `p1` is a constant, we can replace the entire function call with the constant value. Otherwise, we need to keep the function call as is.\n\n2. The function `fn3(p1)` also uses the variable `p1` as a parameter. However, it is not clear from the provided code snippet how `fn3` is called and whether `p1` is a constant or not. If `p1` is a constant and it is not used anywhere else in the code, we can optimize it out by removing the function call entirely.\n\n3. The variable `p1` is not assigned any values within the program. Therefore, there are no assignments to propagate or copy.\n\nBased on the provided code snippet, it is not apparent whether `p1` is a constant or not.
