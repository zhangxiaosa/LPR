We can replace all instances of `v` with its equivalent expressions. In this case, the equivalent expression is `n[0]` since `n[0]` is always assigned the value of `v`. The loop iterations continually update `n[0]` with the value of `v`, and the subsequent assignment statements that depend on `v` also use `n[0]`.
