Replace the variable `i` of type `int` with a primary data type variable, for example, `int i_value = 0;`.\n2. Decompose the struct `g` into its member variable `h`, i.e., `int j_h_value = j.h;`.

For example, `char fn1(char p1, char p2) { return (char)(p1 * p2); }`.\n4. Replace the variable `j` with its decomposed members. In this case, we only have `h`, i.e., `int j_h_value = 0;`.\n5. Replace the function `fn2` with its equivalent logic using primary data types.
