Import the header file `stdint.h` which provides definitions for integer types with specified widths.\n\n2. Define a structure `m` with two members `n` and `o`. Both members are of type `signed` and have specific bit widths (`n` has 18 bits and `o` has 1 bit).\n\n3. Declare an integer variable `r`.\n\n4. Declare a static variable `s` of type `signed` and initialize it with the value -5L.\n\n5. Declare integer variables `t` and `v`.\n\n6. Define a function `fn1` that takes a `uint32_t` (unsigned 32-bit integer) and an integer `p2` as parameters, and returns an integer. The function simply returns the value of `p2`.\n\n7. Define the `main` function, which is the entry point of the program.\n\n8. Declare a structure variable `ad` of type `m` and initialize its member `n` with the value 1957.\n\n9. Call the function `fn1` with arguments `v` and 5, and assign the return value to the member `o` of the structure variable `ad`.\n\n10. Declare a signed integer variable `ae` and assign the value of `ad.o` to it.\n\n11. Assign 0 to the member `o` of the structure variable `ad`.\n\n12. Calculate the value of `r` as the modulo of `t` divided by the bitwise negation of `s` divided by `ae`.\n\n13.

The variable `signed ae` is not considered complex because it is a simple scalar assignment.
