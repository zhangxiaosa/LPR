Inside the nested loop and `if` condition, there is another nested loop that uses the variable `p4`.\n7. Inside the second nested loop, there is an `if` condition that checks if the element at index `p3` in the array `ak` is non-zero.\n8. The `fn4` function returns the value of the variable `g`.\n9.
