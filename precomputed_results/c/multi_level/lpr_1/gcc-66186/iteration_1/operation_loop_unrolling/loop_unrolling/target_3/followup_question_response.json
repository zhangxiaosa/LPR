Unroll the loop with the condition `if (h < 0)`. Since the loop is nested inside another loop, we need to unroll both loops simultaneously.

Start by unrolling the innermost loop (`p4` loop) inside the outermost loop (`p2` loop). Since the loop steps by 2, we can unroll it into 4 iterations: `p4=0`, `p4=2`, `p4=4`, `p4=6`.\n2. For each unrolled iteration of the `p4` loop, check the condition `if (h < 0)` and perform the loop body operations accordingly. If `h >= 0`, continue to the next unrolled iteration.\n3. Unroll the `p2` loop in a similar way, adjusting the `p2` loop variable. Since the `p4` loop is unrolled into 4 iterations, we can unroll the `p2` loop into 2 iterations: `p2=0`, `p2=1`.\n4. For each unrolled iteration of the `p2` loop, execute the unrolled `p4` loop 4 times, adjusting the `p2` and `p4` loop variables accordingly.\n5.
