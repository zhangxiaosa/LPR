Analyze the function to understand its content and purpose:\n   - Initialize variables: `unsigned p2`, `unsigned p3`, `unsigned p4`, and `short ak[8]`\n   - Perform nested loops:\n     - Outer loop: `p2` from 0 to 7, incrementing by 1\n     - Inner loop: `p4` from 0 to 7, incrementing by 2\n   - Check condition: if `h` is less than 0\n     - Perform another inner loop: `p4` from 0 to 7, incrementing by 2\n     - Check condition: if `ak[(unsigned short)p3]` is true\n       - Break out of the loop\n\n3.
