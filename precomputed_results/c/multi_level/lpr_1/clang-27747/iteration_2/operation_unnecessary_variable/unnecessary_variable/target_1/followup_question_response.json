Its usages include the expression `o | -(l.f && l.d) - n`.\n\n2. Constant propagation: Since `l.d` is not a constant, we cannot directly replace `o` with its constant value.\n\n3. Copy propagation: We can replace occurrences of `o` with `l.d` in the expression `o | -(l.f && l.d) - n`.\n\n   Optimized expression: `l.d | -(l.f && l.d) - n`\n\n4. `o` is not used further, so we can optimize it out by removing its declaration and any assignments.\n\n   Optimized program code:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nstruct c {\n  signed d : 18;\n  unsigned e;\n  unsigned f;\n  signed g;\n  signed h;\n};\n\nstruct c i;\nstruct c j;\n\nint main() {\n  struct c l = {24, 6738, 165};\n  l.d = j.e;\n  int n = j.h && l.d;\n  i.g = l.d | -(l.f && l.d) - n;\n\n  // The variable 'n' is not optimized out\n  printf(\"Value of n: %d\\n\", n);\n\n  return 0;\n}\n```\n\n5.

The variable `o` is assigned the value of `l.d` at the line `int o = l.d;`.\n\n2. At this point, we can see that `l.d` is assigned the value of `j.e` at the line `l.d = j.e;`. However, the value of `j.e` is not known from the given code.\n\n3. Since we cannot determine the constant value of `l.d` (through constant propagation), we can look for copy propagation opportunities. Copy propagation involves replacing the uses of a variable with the value it is assigned.\n\n4. We can observe that the variable `o` is only used once in the calculation `i.g = o | -(l.f && l.d) - n;`. To optimize it out, we can directly replace `o` with `l.d` and rewrite the line as `i.g = l.d | -(l.f && l.d) - n;`.\n\nBy performing both constant propagation and copy propagation, the variable `o` can be optimized out from the given program.

The variable `o` can be optimized using copy propagation because its value is simply a copy of `l.d`. Instead of assigning the value of `l.d` to `o`, we can directly use `l.d` wherever `o` is used.\n\n3.
