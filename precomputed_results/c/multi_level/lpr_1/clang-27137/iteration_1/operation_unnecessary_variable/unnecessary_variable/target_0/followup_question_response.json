The variable `i` is used in the for loop condition: `i < 10`. We can see that the loop will iterate 10 times.\n\n3. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop: `i++`.\n\n4. Although the variable `i` is used in the loop, it is not used outside the loop. Therefore, it can be optimized out.\n\nTo optimize the program, we can remove the variable `i` and replace it with the constant value 10 in the for loop condition.
