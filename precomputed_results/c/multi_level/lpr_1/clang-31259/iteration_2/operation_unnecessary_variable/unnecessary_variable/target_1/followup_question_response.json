The variable `ai` is declared as an array of size 2. It is used to store the value 8 in both elements of the array.\n   ```\n   int ai[2];\n   int j;\n   for (j = 0; j < 2; j++)\n     ai[j] = 8;\n   ```\n\n2.

This loop assigns the value 8 to `ai[0]` and `ai[1]` in each iteration.\n   ```\n   for (j = 0; j < 2; j++)\n     ai[j] = 8;\n   ```\n\n3. Since the loop consistently assigns the value 8 to `ai[0]`, we can perform constant propagation.
