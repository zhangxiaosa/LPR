It is initialized with the value `8` for each element.\n\n2. `ai` is modified and used in the innermost loop of the `fn9()` function:\n   ```c\n   v = ai[0] ^= ad_dim1[w + 1][w][af] = fn4(fn2(1, fn2(3, u--)), 4294967295);\n   ```\n\n   In this line, the value of `ai[0]` is updated using the bitwise XOR assignment operator (`^=`), and it is assigned the result of the expression `ad_dim1[w + 1][w][af] = fn4(fn2(1, fn2(3, u--)), 4294967295)`. The array `ad_dim1` and variables `w`, `af`, `fn2()`, `fn4()`, and `u` are also involved in this expression.\n\nTo decompose `ai` into primary data type variables, we can rewrite the program by introducing individual variables for each element of `ai` and replacing their usages accordingly. Here's the modified program:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nunsigned fn2(signed p1, signed p2) { return p1; }\nint fn4(int p1, int p2) { return p1 % p2; }\n\nunsigned f;\nunsigned u;\nint v;\nstatic unsigned w = 254U;\nsigned ad_dim1[3][5][7] = {{{8}}, {{8}}, {{8}, {0x98}}};\nint ae;\nint af;\n\nsigned fn9() {\n  int ai_0;\n  int ai_1;\n  int j;\n  for (j = 0; j < 2; j++) {\n    if (j == 0)\n      ai_0 = 8;\n    else\n      ai_1 = 8;\n  }\n  for (w = 1;;) {\n    for (; j < 4; j++) {\n    }\n    for (af = 6; af >= 0; af -= 1)\n      v = (ai_0 ^= ad_dim1[w + 1][w][af] =\n               fn4(fn2(1, fn2(3, u--)), 4294967295));\n    return ae;\n  }\n}\n\nint main() {\n  fn9();\n  int ai_0 = ad_dim1[2][1][0];\n  int ai_1 = ad_dim1[2][1][1];\n  printf(\"checksum = %x\\n\", ai_0);\n  return 0;\n}\n```\n\nIn the modified program, the `ai` array is replaced with individual variables `ai_0` and `ai_1`, each representing one element of the original array.
