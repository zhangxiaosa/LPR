Define the function `fn2` that takes two `signed` parameters `p1` and `p2` and returns an `unsigned` value. The function simply returns `p1`.\n\n4. Define the function `fn4` that takes two `int` parameters `p1` and `p2` and returns an `int` value. The function performs the modulus operation (`%`) on `p1` and `p2` and returns the result.\n\n5.

The function `fn9` is defined with a return type of `signed`. Inside the function, an array `ai` of type `int` with a size of 2 is declared. The variable `j` is declared as an `int` and initialized with 0. There is a loop that iterates while `j` is less than 2, assigning the value 8 to `ai[j]`, and incrementing `j` by 1. After that, there is an infinite loop that can only be exited by a return statement. Inside the infinite loop, there is an empty loop that doesn't perform any action. Following that, there is a loop that iterates `af` from 6 to 0, decrementing `af` by 1 in each iteration. Inside this loop, several operations are performed: \n   - The variable `v` is assigned the result of XOR operation between `ai[0]` and `ad_dim1[w + 1][w][af]`.\n   - The assignment `ad_dim1[w + 1][w][af]` is performed with the result of calling the function `fn4` with the arguments `fn2(1, fn2(3, u--))` and `4294967295`.\n   - The value of `u` is decremented by 1 after it is used in the function call.\n\n8. The `main` function is defined with a return type of `int`. Inside the function, the `fn9` function is called. The value of `ad_dim1[2][1][0]` is assigned to the variable `f`.
