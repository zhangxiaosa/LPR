The target to be optimized is the function `fn2()`, which takes an unspecified number of arguments and returns an `unsigned` integer.\n2. The function `fn2()` calls the function `fn1()` with various arguments, including local variables `p` of type `struct h` and `q` of type `int`. These local variables are not used further in the function.\n3. Inside the `for` loop of `fn2()`, there are statements: `struct h r;`, `p = r = p;`. These statements assign the value of `p` to `r` and then assign the value of `r` back to `p`. This operation seems redundant and has no effect. We can remove these statements.\n4. The function `fn1()` takes five arguments: `unsigned p1`, `short p2`, `unsigned p3`, `unsigned p4`, and `struct h p5`. This function only references `p5.k;` and contains an infinite loop labeled `w` with a `goto w;` statement. This loop has no side effects and can be removed.\n5. The `main()` function is present but is not relevant to the optimization.\n6. The `struct h` definition contains three members: `signed i`, `long j`, and `unsigned k`.
