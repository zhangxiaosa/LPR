Given the target to be optimized as `d`, we need to identify all occurrences of `struct h` and substitute them with the original data type of `d`.\n3. Looking at the program, we find the following occurrences of `struct h`:\n   - In the structure definition: `struct h { signed i; long j; unsigned k; };`\n   - In the function `fn1` declaration: `static struct h fn1(unsigned, short, unsigned, unsigned, struct h);`\n   - In the function `fn2` definition: `struct h p;`\n   - In the function `fn2` call to `fn1`: `fn1(q, l, p1, 3, p);`\n   - In the assignment within the infinite loop in `fn2`: `struct h r; p = r = p;`\n   - In the function `fn1` definition: `struct h fn1(unsigned p1, short p2, unsigned p3, unsigned p4, struct h p5) { ... }`\n4. Since the target to be optimized is `d`, we need to determine its original data type by examining the code.
