The struct `h` contains three members: `i` (signed int), `j` (long int), and `k` (unsigned int).\n\n3. We have an unsigned int variable:\n   ```c\n   unsigned int l;\n   ```\n\n4. We have a function `fn1` that takes multiple parameters including a struct `h` object.\n   ```c\n   static struct h fn1(unsigned int p1, short int p2, unsigned int p3,\n                       unsigned int p4, struct h p5) {\n     p5.k;\n   w:\n     goto w;\n   }\n   ```\n\n5. The struct `h` object passed as a parameter to `fn1` is named `p5`.\n\n6. The function `fn1` does not modify any of the struct members; it only accesses the member `p5.k`.\n\n7. We have another function `fn2` that takes an int parameter and returns an unsigned int.\n   ```c\n   unsigned int fn2(int p1) {\n     struct h p;\n     int q;\n     fn1(q, l, p1, 3, p);\n     for (;;) {\n       struct h r;\n       p = r = p;\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n8. The struct `h` object inside `fn2` is named `p`.\n\n9. The function `fn2` calls `fn1` with parameters `q` (int), `l` (unsigned int), `p1` (unsigned int), 3 (unsigned int), and `p` (struct h).\n\n10. Inside `fn2`, there's a `for` loop that declares a struct `h` object `r` and assigns the value of `r` to both `p` and `r`.\n\n11. Finally, we have the `main` function that returns an int.\n    ```c\n    int main() {\n      return 0;\n    }\n    ```\n\nBased on this analysis, the decomposed program with variables of primary data types would look like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"program\": \"#include <stdio.h>\\n\\nsigned int i;\\nlong int j;\\nunsigned int k;\\nunsigned int l;\\n\\nstatic signed int fn1(unsigned int p1, short int p2, unsigned int p3,\\n                    unsigned int p4, signed int p5_i, long int p5_j, unsigned int p5_k) {\\n  p5_k;\\nw:\\n  goto w;\\n}\\n\\nunsigned int fn2(int p1) {\\n  signed int p_i;\\n  long int p_j;\\n  unsigned int p_k;\\n  int q;\\n  fn1(q, l, p1, 3, p_i, p_j, p_k);\\n  for (;;) {\\n    signed int r_i;\\n    long int r_j;\\n    unsigned int r_k;\\n    p_i = r_i;\\n    p_j = r_j;\\n    p_k = r_k;\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nint main() {\\n  return 0;\\n}\"\n}\n```\n\nNote: In the decomposed program, the variable names are based on the original struct member names appended with the corresponding struct variable name.
