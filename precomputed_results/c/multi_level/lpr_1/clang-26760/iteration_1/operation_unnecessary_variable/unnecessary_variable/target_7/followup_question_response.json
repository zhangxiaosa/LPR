As `p` is used in a condition `while (p)`, and `g` is an `int` type, we need to ensure that the condition works correctly. We can consider changing the type of `g` to `unsigned` to match the type of `p`.\n\n3.

We can optimize it out completely.\n   - The inner for-loop `for (; j; --j)` has a condition that is always `true`, but it doesn't have any side effects. We can also optimize it out completely.\n\n4.
