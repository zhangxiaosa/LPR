We need to analyze the usage and propagation of the variable `at`.\n2. The variable `at` is initialized with the value 1.\n3. There is no further direct usage of the variable `at` in the program.\n4. The variable `at` is used as an argument to `fn2(ap, at)` in the expression `fn3(aj, fn2(ap, at)) != 0`.\n5. The function `fn2(p1, p2)` computes the logical AND (`&&` operator) of `p1` and `p2` and returns `p1` if the result is true and `p1 % p2` otherwise.\n6. Since `p2` is the variable `at`, it contains the value 1, which means the logical AND will always evaluate to the value of `p1`.\n7. Therefore, the expression `fn3(aj, fn2(ap, at)) != 0` is equivalent to `fn3(aj, ap) != 0`.\n8. The result of the expression `fn3(aj, ap) != 0` is then passed as an argument to `~()` (bitwise complement) in the expression `~(fn3(aj, fn2(ap, at)) != 0)`.\n9. Since the result of `fn3(aj, ap) != 0` is either 0 (false) or 1 (true), applying `~()` to it will yield the complemented value.\n10. The complemented value is then passed as an argument to `fn8()` in the expression `fn8(~(fn3(aj, fn2(ap, at)) != 0), ak)`.\n11. The function `fn8(p1, p2)` computes the sum of `p1` and `p2` and returns the result.\n12. Since the result of `~(fn3(aj, fn2(ap, at)) != 0)` is either -1 (complement of 0) or -2 (complement of 1), its value will not affect the final result of the sum in `fn8()`.\n13. Therefore, the expression `fn8(~(fn3(aj, fn2(ap, at)) != 0), ak)` is equivalent to `fn8(0, ak)` or `fn8(1, ak)`.\n14. Finally, the value of `fn8(0, ak)` or `fn8(1, ak)` is passed as an argument to `fn7(4UL, fn6(aq, fn5(ai, au[4][1][5] = fn8(~(fn3(aj, fn2(ap, at)) != 0), ak) && 0x57L)))`.\n15.

The result of `fn6(aq, fn5(ai, 0))` or `fn6(aq, fn5(ai, 1))` is then compared to 2 in the condition `w >= (fn7(4UL, fn6(aq, fn5(ai, au[4][1][5] = fn8(~(fn3(aj, fn2(ap, at)) != 0), ak) && 0x57L))) > 2)`.\n17.

The result of the condition will affect the assignment to `v` or `ao`, not the value of `at`.\n21.
