The program includes the header file `stdio.h`, which provides functions for input and output.\n\n2. Function definitions are provided for `fn2`, `fn5`, `fn6`, and `fn8`. These functions have primitive data types as parameters and return values.\n\n3. The program declares the following variables with primitive data types:\n   - `unsigned f`: Unsigned integer\n   - `unsigned w`: Unsigned integer initialized with the value `0xDC6F3D13L`\n   - `long long ag_3`: Long long integer\n   - `int ah`: Integer\n   - `int ak`: Integer\n   - `int am`: Integer initialized with the value `0x41AEA787L`\n   - `int ao`: Integer\n   - `unsigned ap`: Unsigned integer\n\n4. The `main()` function is defined.\n\n5. The `main()` function declares the following variables with primitive data types:\n   - `int au_4_1_5`: Integer\n\n6. The `main()` function initializes the variable `ak` with the value `0`.\n\n7. The `main()` function contains a `for` loop where the variable `ah` is incremented from 0 to 3.\n\n8. Inside the `for` loop, an `if` statement is used to check a condition involving function calls and comparison operators.\n   - The function `fn6` is called with arguments `0` and the result of the function call `fn5(1110486715, au_4_1_5 = fn8(~(fn2(ap, 1L) != 0), ak) && 0x57L)`\n   - The result of the comparison `w >= (fn6(0, ...))` is then compared with `2`.\n\n9. Inside the `if` condition block, the variables `f` and `ag_3` are assigned values.\n\n10. Inside the `else` block of the `if` statement, the variable `ao` is assigned a value.\n\n11. Finally, the program prints the value of `f` using `printf`.\n\nBased on this analysis, the variables with complex data types are not found. The program only uses primitive data types.
