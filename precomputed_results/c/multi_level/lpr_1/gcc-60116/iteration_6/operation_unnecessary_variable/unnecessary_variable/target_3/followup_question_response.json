Here is the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. The variable `p1` is initially passed as an argument to functions `fn2`, `fn5`, `fn6`, and `fn8`.\n\n2. `fn2( )` is called with the arguments `ap` and `1L`. Since `ap` is not a constant, we cannot optimize out `p1` in this call.\n\n3. `fn5( )` is called with the arguments `1110486715` and `au_4_1_5 = fn8(~(fn2(ap, 1L) != 0), ak) && 0x57L`. In this case, `1110486715` is a constant, so we can replace `p1` in `fn5( )` with this value.\n\n4. `fn6( )` is called with the arguments `0` and `fn5(1110486715, au_4_1_5 = fn8(~(fn2(ap, 1L) != 0), ak) && 0x57L)`. Again, `fn5(1110486715, au_4_1_5 = fn8(~(fn2(ap, 1L) != 0), ak) && 0x57L)` is a constant, so we can replace `p1` in `fn6( )` with this value.\n\n5. `fn8( )` is called with the arguments `~(fn2(ap, 1L) != 0)` and `ak`. Since the value of `p1` in this call depends on the result of `fn2(ap, 1L)`, we cannot optimize out `p1` in this call.\n\n6. Finally, the result of `fn6( )` is compared with the value `2` in the `if` condition. Since the result is a constant, we can evaluate this condition during compile-time and eliminate the corresponding branch of the `if` statement.\n\nBased on the optimizations described above, the optimized program is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"program\": \"#include <stdio.h>\\n\\nint fn2(int p1, int p2) { return p1 && p2 ? p1 : p1 % p2; }\\nint fn5(int p1, int p2) { return 1110486715; }\\nunsigned fn6(unsigned p1, unsigned p2) { return 0xDC6F3D13L; }\\nlong long fn8(long p1, long long p2) { return p1 + p2; }\\nunsigned f;\\nunsigned w = 0xDC6F3D13L;\\nlong long ag_3;\\nint ah;\\nint ak;\\nint am = 0x41AEA787L;\\nint ao;\\nunsigned ap;\\n\\nint main() {\\n  int au_4_1_5;\\n  ak = 0;\\n  for (ah = 0; ah <= 3; ah += 1)\\n    if (w >= (0xDC6F3D13L > 2)) {\\n      f = am;\\n      ag_3 = au_4_1_5;\\n    } else\\n      ao = fn8(~((ap && 1L) != 0), ak) && 0x57L;\\n  printf(\\\"checksum = %X\\\\n\\\", f);\\n  return 0;\\n}\"\n}\n```\n\nNote: The optimization does not eliminate the variable `p1` completely from the program since it is still used in the `fn8` call.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:\n\n1. The target variable `p1` is not explicitly defined in the given program. It is referenced in two functions: `fn2` and `fn8`. Let's analyze these functions:\n\n   - In `fn2(int p1, int p2)`, the return statement checks if both `p1` and `p2` are non-zero. If true, it returns the value of `p1`, otherwise it returns the remainder of `p1` divided by `p2`. Since `p1` is used directly, it cannot be optimized out by constant propagation or copy propagation in this function.\n\n   - In `fn8(long p1, long long p2)`, the return statement adds `p1` and `p2` together. The variable `p1` can be optimized out because its value is not modified or used anywhere else in the program. We can replace all occurrences of `fn8(~(fn2(ap, 1L) != 0), ak)` in the program with just `fn8(ak)`.\n\n2.

The target variable `p1` is defined in `fn2` and `fn5` functions. However, in both functions, it is not used in any expressions that affect the program's output. Hence, the variable `p1` can be optimized out by removing the corresponding function calls or replacing them with constant values.\n\n2. In the `main` function, the following occurrences of `p1` are found:\n   - In the condition of the `if` statement:\n     - `fn2(ap, 1L) != 0`: Since the return value of `fn2` is not used, the entire expression can be optimized out.\n   - In the argument of `fn5` function call:\n     - `fn5(1110486715, au_4_1_5 = fn8(~(fn2(ap, 1L) != 0), ak) && 0x57L)`: Here, the result of `fn2` is used but not the result of `fn5`.
