The target variable to be optimized is `p2`.\n2. It is used in the following functions:\n   - `fn2`: The value of `p2` is used in the conditional expression `p1 && p2 ? p1 : p1 % p2`, but the optimized value of `p2` will not affect the result of this expression, as the value of `p1` is not dependent on `p2`. Therefore, the result of the expression will always be the same regardless of the value of `p2`. We can replace `p2` with any constant value.\n   - `fn8`: The value of `p2` is used in the addition expression `p1 + p2`. The result of this expression depends on the value of `p1` and `p2`, so we cannot optimize out `p2` in this function.\n\n3. In the `main` function, `p2` is used in the following places:\n   - In the call to `fn5(1110486715, au_4_1_5 = fn8(~(fn2(ap, 1L) != 0), ak) && 0x57L)`: Since `fn5` returns a constant value `1110486715`, we can replace `p2` in this call with the constant value.\n   - In the call to `fn8(~(fn2(ap, 1L) != 0), ak) && 0x57L)`: This call doesn't affect the final result or any variable assignments.
