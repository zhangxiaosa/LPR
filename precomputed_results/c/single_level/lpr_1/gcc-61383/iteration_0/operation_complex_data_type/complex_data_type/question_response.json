However, there are no structure or class definitions provided in the given program. Therefore, we cannot decompose the variables of a complex data type into primary data types.\n\nThe program consists of several function definitions and global variable declarations.\n\n1. The function `fn1` takes two parameters of type `signed` and returns a value of type `signed`. It checks if the second parameter (`p2`) is equal to 0 and returns the first parameter (`p1`) if true. Otherwise, it calculates the modulus of `p1` with `p2` and returns the result.\n\n2. The function `fn2` takes two parameters of type `short` and `int`, respectively, and returns a value of type `short`. It simply returns the value of the first parameter (`p1`).\n\n3. The function `fn3` takes two parameters of type `int` and returns a value of type `int`. It performs several logical and arithmetic operations to determine the return value based on the given conditions.\n\n4. The global variables `l`, `m`, `n`, and `o` are declared as `signed`, `unsigned`, `unsigned`, and `signed` types, respectively.\n\n5. The static global variable `p` is declared as an `unsigned` type and initialized with the hexadecimal value `0x01B28DB7L`.\n\n6. The function `fn4` takes three parameters of types `signed`, `unsigned`, and `unsigned`, respectively, and returns a value of type `int`. It calls the function `fn5` with the global variable `o` as an argument. If the return value of `fn5(o)` is non-zero, it does nothing. Otherwise, it returns the value of the second parameter (`p2`).\n\n7. The function `fn5` takes one parameter of type `signed` and returns a value of type `short`. It includes a loop that iterates as long as the global variable `n` is less than 12. Inside the loop, there is a declaration of a local variable `ab` of type `int`. It checks a condition and performs certain operations based on the result. It then returns the value of the global variable `m`.\n\n8. The `main` function declares a local variable `u` of type `short` and initializes it with the value `0L`. It then calls the function `fn4` with the local variable `u`, the global variable `l`, and the local variable `u` as arguments. If the return value of `fn4(u, l, u)` is non-zero, it does nothing.\n\nTo summarize, the program does not contain any complex data type definitions.
