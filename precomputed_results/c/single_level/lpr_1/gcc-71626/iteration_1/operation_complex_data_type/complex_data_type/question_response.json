The program defines a function named `fn1` that takes no arguments and has no return type.\n2. It then declares a custom data type `d` using `typedef`. This custom data type `d` is a vector of type `long` with a size equal to the size of `long`.\n3. The program defines another function named `fn2` that returns a variable of type `d`.\n4. Inside `fn2`, a variable `c` of type `long` is declared and assigned the value of `fn1`. However, `fn1` is not a function call but rather a placeholder.\n5. The variable `f` of type `d` is declared and initialized with the value of `c` using a brace-enclosed initializer list.\n6. Finally, the function `fn2` returns the variable `f`.\n7.
