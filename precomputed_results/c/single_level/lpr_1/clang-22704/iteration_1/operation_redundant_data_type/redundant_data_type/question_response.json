The program declares two variables: `int d;` and `int e;`.\n2. The program defines a function called `fn1` with a return type of `char`.\n3. Inside the `fn1` function, there is a variable declaration `int h = 6L;`. The `h` variable is assigned the value `6L`, which is a long integer constant.\n4. There is an if statement `if (e)` that checks the value of the variable `e`. If `e` evaluates to a non-zero value, the program jumps to the label `i`.\n5. There is a recursive function call `fn1();` inside the `fn1` function.\n6. The `fn1` function returns the hexadecimal constant `0xEEACFBBFL` of type `long`.\n7. There is a label `i`, followed by an assignment statement `d = h;`.\n8. After the assignment, there is another recursive function call `fn1();`.\n9. Finally, the `fn1` function returns the hexadecimal constant `0xEEACFBBFL` of type `long`.\n10. The program defines the `main` function with a return type of `int`, but the function body is empty.\n\nThe redundant data type in the program is the return type of the `fn1` function, which is `char`. It is redundant because the function always returns the same value `0xEEACFBBFL`, which is a long integer constant.
