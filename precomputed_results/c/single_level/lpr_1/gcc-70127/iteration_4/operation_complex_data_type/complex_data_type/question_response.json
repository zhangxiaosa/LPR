The complex data type in this program is the structure `struct p`, which consists of two variables: `int ab` and `signed q : 22`. \n2. The `int ab` variable of struct p can be decomposed into the primary data type `int`.\n3. The `signed q : 22` variable of struct p can be decomposed into the primary data type `signed int`.\n4. The structure `struct r` consists of two variables: `unsigned ab` and `unsigned s`. These variables are already primary data types and do not need decomposition.\n5. The program also declares other variables of primary data types such as `unsigned j`, `unsigned u`, and `int i`.\n6. An array of `struct p` named `v` is declared, which can be decomposed as an array of primary data types: `int v.ab[]` and `signed int v.q[]`.\n7. The variable `w` of struct p is initialized with the values `0x1C87E74FL` and `816`, which are primary data types.\n8. The function `fn5` takes four arguments: `unsigned p1`, `signed p2`, `unsigned p3`, and `unsigned p4`. These arguments are already primary data types and do not need decomposition.\n9. The function uses the variables `a`, `p2`, `u`, `v`, and `w`, which have already been analyzed in previous steps.\n10. The `main` function declares the variable `int i`, which is a primary data type.\n11. The `main` function calls the `fn5` function with arguments `t.ab`, `3`, `2`, and `t.s`, which are already primary data types.\n12. Inside a loop, the value of `v[i].q` is assigned to `j`. This can be decomposed as `j = v[i].q`.\n13.
