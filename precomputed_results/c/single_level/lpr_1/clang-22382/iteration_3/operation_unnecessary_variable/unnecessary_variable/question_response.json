The program defines a struct `h` with three fields: `i` (signed integer), `j` (long), and `k` (unsigned integer).\n3. The program declares a global variable `l` of type unsigned integer.\n4.

Inside `fn2`, a local variable `p` of type `struct h` is declared, as well as a local variable `q` of type `int`.\n7.
