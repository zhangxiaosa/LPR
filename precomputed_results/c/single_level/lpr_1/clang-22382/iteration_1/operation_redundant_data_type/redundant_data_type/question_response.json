We need to identify the redundant typedef and substitute every instance of it with its associated original data type.\n\n2. Next, there is a struct declaration:\n   ```c\n   struct h {\n     signed i;\n     c j;\n     unsigned k;\n   };\n   ```\n\n   The struct `h` has three members: `i` of type `signed` (which is equivalent to `int`), `j` of type `c` (which is equivalent to `long`), and `k` of type `unsigned`.\n\n3. Following the struct declaration, there is a variable declaration:\n   ```c\n   d l;\n   ```\n\n   The variable `l` is of type `d`, which is equivalent to `unsigned`.\n\n4.
