The main function calls other functions in a specific order. The program maintains some global variables and performs arithmetic and logical operations.\n\nStep 2: Identify the function to optimize\n\nWe need to identify a function to optimize through function inlining. In function inlining, the code of the function is inserted directly into the calling code instead of making a function call. This optimization can improve performance by reducing the overhead of function calls.\n\nTo identify a function for optimization, we can look at the call graph and analyze the dependencies between functions. A good candidate for inlining is a function that is called only once and doesn't have complex dependencies.\n\nIn this program, the \"fn13\" function is a potential candidate for optimization. It is called from the main function and doesn't have any dependencies on other functions. Let's consider optimizing this function through inlining.\n\nStep 3: Optimize the selected function through inlining\n\nTo optimize the \"fn13\" function through inlining, we need to replace its function call with the actual code present in the function body.
