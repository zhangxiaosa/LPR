The complex data type used in the program is a structure or class, but it is not explicitly defined in the program. So, we cannot decompose any variables from a structure or class. \n\n2. The program defines the following variables of primary data types:\n   - `unsigned p;` (unsigned integer)\n   - `unsigned t;` (unsigned integer)\n   - `long v;` (long integer)\n   - `short w;` (short integer)\n   - `unsigned ab;` (unsigned integer)\n   - `short ac = 1L;` (short integer with an initial value of 1)\n\n3. The program also contains several function definitions:\n   - `void fn1(p1) { printf(\"checksum = %X\\n\", p1); }` (void function)\n   - `int fn2(int p1, int p2) { return p1 - p2; }` (integer function)\n   - `long fn3(long p1, long p2) { return p1 - p2; }` (long function)\n   - `unsigned char fn4(unsigned p1, unsigned p2) { return p1; }` (unsigned char function)\n   - `unsigned fn5(unsigned p1, unsigned p2) { return p2; }` (unsigned integer function)\n   - `unsigned fn6(unsigned p1, unsigned p2) { return p1 - p2; }` (unsigned integer function)\n   - `unsigned char fn11(unsigned char, unsigned, int, short);` (unsigned char function)\n\n4. The function `fn7` accepts a parameter `p1`, but its data type is not specified. It assigns the value of `p1` to the variable `p`, which is an unsigned integer.\n\n5. The function `fn13` does not use any variables of complex data types. It defines the following variables:\n   - `short ae = 1UL;` (short integer with an initial value of 1)\n   - `unsigned ag = 248UL;` (unsigned integer with an initial value of 248)\n   - It calls the function `fn11`, passing arguments of different primary data types:\n\n6.

The `main` function does not define any complex data type variables.

There are multiple functions defined, including `fn1`, `fn2`, `fn3`, `fn4`, `fn5`, `fn6`, `fn7`, and `fn11`.\n2. The function `fn1` takes a single parameter `p1` of an unknown data type and prints its value in hexadecimal format using `printf`.\n3. The function `fn2` takes two `int` parameters `p1` and `p2` and returns the difference between them.\n4. The function `fn3` takes two `long` parameters `p1` and `p2` and returns the difference between them.\n5. The function `fn4` takes two `unsigned` parameters `p1` and `p2` and returns `p1`.\n6. The function `fn5` takes two `unsigned` parameters `p1` and `p2` and returns `p2`.\n7. The function `fn6` takes two `unsigned` parameters `p1` and `p2` and returns the difference between them.\n8. The main program declares some variables: `unsigned p`, `unsigned t`, `long v`, `short w`, `unsigned ab`, `short ac`, and a function prototype `unsigned char fn11(unsigned char, unsigned, int, short)`.\n9. The function `fn7` takes a single parameter `p1` of an unknown data type and assigns its value to the variable `p`.\n10. The function `fn13` declares some variables: `short ae`, `unsigned ag`, and `unsigned fn11_result`. It then calls the function `fn11` with specific arguments and assigns the result to `fn11_result`. Finally, it returns the value of `ae`.\n11. The function `fn11` takes four parameters of unknown data types: `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `p4`. It declares some variables: `int an`, `short al`, and `long am`. Inside a loop, it checks if `an` is equal to `250UL` and assigns the result of the comparison to `p2`. It also declares a variable `short ao` and performs a nested function call using `fn2`, `fn3`, `fn4`, and `fn6`. The result of the function call is then bitwise ANDed with `1UL`, and if the result is true, the variable `v` is assigned `1UL`. Finally, it returns the value of `al`.\n12. The `main` function calls `fn13`, `fn7`, and `fn1` with specific arguments and returns 0.\n\nBased on the analysis, the complex data type in this program is not explicitly defined. All the variables are declared with primary data types (`int`, `float`, `short`, `unsigned`, `long`, `unsigned char`).
