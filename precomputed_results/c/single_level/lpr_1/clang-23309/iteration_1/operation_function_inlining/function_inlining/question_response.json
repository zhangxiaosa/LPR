The program begins with six functions: `fn1`, `fn2`, `fn3`, `fn4`, `fn5`, and `fn6`, which perform various calculations and return values of different types.\n2. After the function declarations, there are several global variables defined: `p`, `t`, `u`, `v`, `w`, `ab`, and `ac`.\n3. The program continues with function definitions for `fn7`, `fn8`, `fn9`, `fn10`, `fn11`, `fn12`, and `fn13`.\n4. The `main` function is the entry point of the program.\n5. In the `main` function, a local variable `ap` is defined and initialized to 0.\n6. The `fn13` function is called, which in turn calls the `fn10` function with arguments `u` and `t`. The return value of `fn10` is not used.\n7. The `fn9` function is called with arguments `v`, \"g_170\", and `ap`. It calls `fn8` with the argument `v`, which in turn calls `fn7` with the same argument. The purpose of these function calls is to assign the value of `v` to the global variable `p`.\n8. The `fn1` function is called with arguments `p` and `ap`. It prints the value of `p` as a checksum in hexadecimal format using `printf`.\n9. The `main` function returns 0, indicating successful program termination.\n\nTo optimize out a function via function inlining, we need to replace any function calls to that function with the body of the function itself.
