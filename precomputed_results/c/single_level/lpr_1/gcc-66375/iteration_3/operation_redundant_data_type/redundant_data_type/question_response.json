The program defines several functions: `fn2`, `fn3`, `fn4`, `fn5`, `fn9`, `fn10`, and `fn11`.\n2. There are also global variables defined: `p`, `t`, `u`, and `v_0_3`.\n3. The `fn11` function calls `fn9` with various arguments and returns 0.\n4. The `fn9` function calls `fn10` with some arguments and returns the value of `p2`.\n5. The `fn10` function initializes a variable `d` and enters a loop.\n    - In the loop, it initializes an array `e` and assigns a value to each element.\n    - It then calls `fn4`, `fn2`, and `fn3` functions with corresponding arguments and assigns the result to `d`.\n6. The `main` function calls `fn11` and `fn5` with some arguments and then prints the value of `p`.\n\nNow let's identify the redundant data type and substitute it with its associated original data type.
