Define function `fn2` which takes a `char` parameter `p1` and an `int` parameter `p2`. It returns a `char` value equal to `p1`.\n2. Define function `fn3` which takes two `short` parameters `p1` and `p2`. It returns a `short` value equal to `p2`.\n3. Declare global variables `p`, `u`, `v_0_3`, and `e_0`.\n4. Define the `main` function.\n5. Declare a local variable `d` and initialize it with the value `2L`.\n6. Enter a `for` loop with the loop condition `u < 51`.\n7. Set the value of `e_0` to `0x9EE7F9D1C772505B`.\n8. Calculate the value of `v_0_3` by calling the function `fn3` with parameters `4L` and `d`, and assign the result to `v_0_3`.\n9. Calculate the value of `d` by calling the function `fn2` with parameters `v_0_3` and `3`, adding the result to `e_0`, and assign the sum to `d`.\n10. Increment the value of `u` by `1`.\n11. Repeat steps 7-10 until `u` is no longer less than `51`.\n12. Assign the value of `v_0_3` to the global variable `p`.\n13.
