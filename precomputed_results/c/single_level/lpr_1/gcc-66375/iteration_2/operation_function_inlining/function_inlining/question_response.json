The program consists of several functions: `fn2`, `fn3`, `fn4`, `fn5`, `fn6`, `fn8`, `fn9`, `fn10`, and `fn11`, as well as the `main` function.\n2. Among the functions, we need to find a suitable candidate for function inlining optimization. Function inlining involves replacing a function call with the actual function body to avoid the overhead of a function call.\n3. After analyzing the functions, we can choose `fn8` as the candidate for function inlining since it has a relatively simple body and is called only once.\n4. To perform function inlining, we replace the function call `fn8(t, a)` in `fn11` with the actual body of `fn8`.\n5. After performing the function inlining, the updated `fn11` becomes:\n   ```c\n   short fn11() {\n     char a = 0xFBL;\n     fn9(0xFBL, 0xFBL, t, 18446744073709551613UL, t);\n     return 0;\n   }\n   ```\n6. Now we can remove the function `fn8` from the program since it has been inlined.\n7. The updated program after inlining `fn8` and removing the function definition is as follows:\n   ```c\n   char fn2(char p1, int p2) { return p1; }\n   short fn3(short p1, short p2) { return p2; }\n   unsigned fn4(unsigned p1, unsigned p2) { return p1 + p2; }\n   unsigned p;\n   void fn5(p1) { p = p1; }\n   void fn6(p1) { fn5(p1); }\n   unsigned t;\n   unsigned u;\n   unsigned v_0_3;\n   unsigned fn9(unsigned, unsigned, int, unsigned, int);\n   int fn10(int, unsigned, unsigned, int);\n   short fn11() {\n     char a = 0xFBL;\n     fn9(0xFBL, 0xFBL, t, 18446744073709551613UL, t);\n     return 0;\n   }\n   unsigned fn9(unsigned p1, unsigned p2, int p3, unsigned p4, int p5) {\n     unsigned c = 255UL;\n     fn10(6, c, 1, p1);\n     return p2;\n   }\n   int fn10(int p1, unsigned p2, unsigned p3, int p4) {\n     int d = 2L;\n     for (; u < 51; ++u) {\n       unsigned e[9];\n       int i;\n       for (i = 0; i < 9; i++)\n         e[i] = 0x9EE7F9D1C772505BLL;\n       d = fn4(fn2(v_0_3 = fn3(4L, d), 3), e[0]);\n     }\n     return 3;\n   }\n   int main() {\n     fn11();\n     fn6(v_0_3);\n     printf(\"checksum = %X\\n\", p);\n     return 0;\n   }\n   ```\n8.
