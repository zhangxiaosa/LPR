The program declares several variables of different data types: `g`, `h`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `l`, `m`, and `n`.\n2. There are three function declarations: `fn1`, `fn2`, and `fn3`.\n3. Function `fn1` takes three parameters: `signed`, `short`, and `signed`. Inside the function, there is an assignment statement `m[1][0][1] = p1` which assigns `p1` to a specific element of the array `m`.\n4. Function `fn2` is declared with an implicit return type of `signed` and an unspecified number of parameters. Inside the function, there is a for loop that uses the global variable `i` as the loop counter. The loop condition checks the value of `k`. There are two return statements: `return v[g][l][l]` and `return j[g][g]`.\n5. Function `fn3` has a return type of `unsigned` and does not take any parameters. It calls `fn1` and `fn2` and returns the value of the global variable `n`.\n6. The `main` function has a return type of `int` and does not take any parameters. It calls `fn1` and `fn2` and returns the value of the global variable `n`.\n\nFrom the given program, the redundant data type is the typedef for the function signature of `fn1`.

The program defines several variables of different data types:\n   - `g` is defined as a static short with an initial value of `0x7EBA`.\n   - `h` is defined as an unsigned int with an initial value of `0xCA`.\n   - `i` is defined as a short without an initial value.\n   - `j` is defined as a 2D array of ints with dimensions [5][5].\n   - `k` is defined as an unsigned int with an initial value of `0xAF7C65D6L`.\n   - `l` is defined as a static unsigned int without an initial value.\n   - `m` is defined as a 3D array of unsigned ints with dimensions [9][2][3].\n   - `n` is defined as an int without an initial value.\n\n2. The program defines three function declarations:\n   - `fn1` is declared as a function that takes three arguments: `signed`, `short`, and `signed`, and returns an unsigned int.\n   - `fn2` is declared as a function that takes no arguments and returns a signed int.\n   - `fn3` is declared as a function that takes no arguments and returns an unsigned int.\n\n3. The program includes the definitions of the three functions mentioned above.\n\n4. The `fn3` function is defined, which calls the `fn1` function with arguments `fn2(0)`, `7`, and `0`. It then returns the value of the variable `n`.\n\n5. The `fn1` function is defined, which takes three arguments: `p1` (signed), `p2` (short), and `p4` (signed). Inside the function, there is a logical OR operation between `p1` and an assignment statement that assigns `p1` to `m[1][0][1]`. The function returns the value `2`.\n\n6. The `fn2` function is defined, which takes one argument `p1` (implicitly declared as an int). Inside the function, there is a variable `v` defined as a 3D array of unsigned ints with dimensions [6][3][2]. There is also a variable `w` defined as an int with an initial value of `0x709BFC8A`. Inside a for loop, there is an assignment statement that assigns `0` to `i`. There is an `if` statement that checks the value of `k`, and if it's non-zero, it breaks out of the loop. If the `k` value is zero, it returns the value of `v[g][l][l]`. There is another `if` statement that checks the value of `h`, and if it's non-zero, it does nothing. Otherwise, it returns the value of `j[g][g]`. Finally, there is an empty `for` loop that continues as long as `p1` is non-zero and then returns the value of `w`.\n\n7. The `main` function is defined, which calls the `fn1` function with arguments `fn2(0)`, `7`, and `0`. It then returns the value of the variable `n`.\n\nTo identify the redundant data type, we look for any instances where the programmer uses `typedef` to define a custom data type. However, in this provided program, there is no explicit use of `typedef` or any other custom data type definition. Therefore, there is no redundant data type to substitute in this case.\n\nFinal modified program:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"program\": \"#include <stdio.h>\\n\\nstatic short g = 0x7EBA;\\nunsigned h = 0xCA;\\nshort i;\\nint j[5][5];\\nunsigned k = 0xAF7C65D6L;\\nstatic unsigned l;\\nunsigned m[9][2][3];\\nint n;\\n\\nunsigned fn1(signed, short, signed);\\nsigned fn2();\\n\\nunsigned fn3() {\\n  fn1(fn2(0), 7, 0);\\n  return n;\\n}\\n\\nunsigned fn1(signed p1, short p2, signed p4) {\\n  p1 || (m[1][0][1] = p1);\\n  return 2;\\n}\\n\\nsigned fn2(p1) {\\n  unsigned v[6][3][2];\\n  int w = 0x709BFC8A;\\n  for (i = 0;;) {\\n    if (k)\\n      break;\\n    return v[(int)g][(int)l][(int)l];\\n  }\\n  if (h)\\n    ;\\n  else\\n    return j[(int)g][(int)g];\\n  for (; p1;) {\\n  }\\n  return w;\\n}\\n\\nint main() {\\n  fn1(fn2(0), 7, 0);\\n  return n;\\n}\\n\"\n}\n```\n\nNote: The program is provided in JSON format using Markdown syntax for clarity.
