The loop structure in the program is found in the function `fn2`. It contains a `for` loop and a `while` loop.\n\n2. To optimize the loop, we will apply loop unrolling.\n\n3. In the `for` loop of `fn2`, we can see that it has no condition for termination (the condition `if (k) break;` doesn't affect the loop itself). Therefore, we can unroll the loop completely.\n\n4. Since the loop is unrolled, we can remove the loop structure and replace it with its unrolled version.\n\n5. The `while` loop in `fn2` doesn't have any statements inside, so it can be removed as well.\n\n6.
