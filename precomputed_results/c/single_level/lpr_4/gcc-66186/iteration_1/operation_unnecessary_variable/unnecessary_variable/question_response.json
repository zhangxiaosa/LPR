Inside fn5, two variables s and u are initialized with specific values. Then, the function fn3 is called with some arguments. The result of fn3 is used in an if statement, but the if statement does not have any side effects or meaningful consequence. Finally, the fn5 function returns 1.\n\nThe fn3 function takes five parameters: p1, p2, p3, p4, and p5. It initializes two variables ad and ae with specific values. The function then calls fn4 with some arguments and uses the result in an if statement, which again has no side effects or meaningful consequence. Finally, the function returns ae.\n\nThe fn4 function takes five parameters: p1, p2, p3, p4, and p5. It initializes an array ak with eight elements. Then, there are nested for loops that iterate over p2 and p4 with specific conditions. Inside the loops, there is an if statement that checks the value of the variable h. If h is less than 0, there is another nested for loop that iterates over p4. Inside this inner loop, there is another if statement that checks the value of ak[p3]. If the condition is met, the inner loop is broken. Finally, the function returns the value of the variable g.\n\nStep 2: Perform constant propagation and copy propagation optimizations.\n\nIn the given program, all the variables used are either function parameters or global variables.
