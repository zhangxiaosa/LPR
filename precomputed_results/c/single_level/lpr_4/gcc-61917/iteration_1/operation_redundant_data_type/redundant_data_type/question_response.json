Inside the nested loop, there is a loop that assigns values to `k` starting from 0 and decreasing by 6 each iteration until `k` is less than or equal to -27.\n7. After the nested loops, there is an expression `p1 = 79 - p1;` that subtracts `p1` from 79 and assigns the result back to `p1`.\n8. Finally, there is an expression `p1 || m[2][5];` that performs a logical OR between `p1` and `m[2][5]`, but the result is not used.\n\nThe redundant data type in this program is `c`. It is defined as `int` using the `typedef` declaration, but it is not necessary to define a new type for `int` since `int` is already a built-in type in C.
