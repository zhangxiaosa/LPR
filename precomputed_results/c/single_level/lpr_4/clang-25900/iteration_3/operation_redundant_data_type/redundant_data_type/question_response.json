The program starts with two typedef statements:\n   - `typedef unsigned e;`\n   - `typedef unsigned g;`\n\n2. The next section defines a function `fn1()` with the return type `e`. The parameters are `p1` of type `e` and `p2` of type `int`.\n\n3. The program defines a struct `m` with two bit fields: `n` of type `signed` with 18 bits and `o` of type `signed` with 1 bit.\n\n4.

The program defines a function `fn1` that takes an `e` type (`typedef unsigned`) parameter `p1` and an `int` parameter `p2`.
