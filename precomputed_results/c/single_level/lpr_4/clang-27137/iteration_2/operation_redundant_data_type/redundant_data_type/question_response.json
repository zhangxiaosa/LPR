The program declares a variable `unsigned h` which is of type `unsigned int`.\n2. The program defines a function `fn2` that takes an argument `p1` but does not specify the data type. By default, C assumes it to be an `int`.\n3. The function `fn2` assigns the value of `p1` to `h`.\n4. The program declares a variable `short o`.\n5. In the `main` function, a variable `short q` is declared and initialized with the value of `o`.\n6. Another variable `int s` is declared and initialized with the value `1L`.\n7. The program enters a series of `while` loops that decrement the value of `q` until it is not greater than `s`.\n8. After the loops, the function `fn2` is called with `q` as the argument.\n9. The program then prints the value of `h` in hexadecimal format using `printf`.\n\nTo eliminate the redundant data type, we need to replace the occurrences of the typedef with its associated original data type.
