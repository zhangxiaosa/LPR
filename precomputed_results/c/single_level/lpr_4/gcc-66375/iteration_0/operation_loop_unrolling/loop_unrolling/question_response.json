Here is the step-by-step analysis and optimization for loop unrolling:\n\n1. In the `fn8` function, there is a `for` loop that iterates while `u < 51`. The loop increment is `++u`, indicating that `u` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.\n2. Inside the loop, there is another loop that initializes and assigns values to an array `e[9]` using the loop variable `i`. The loop runs for `i` from 0 to 8, incrementing by 1 in each iteration.\n3. After the nested loop, there are two function calls: `fn3`, `fn2`, and `fn4`.\n4. The loop variable `u` is incremented in each iteration of the loop until it reaches 51.\n5. The loop can be unrolled by manually expanding its iterations and eliminating the inner loop.
