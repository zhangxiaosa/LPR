The program declares a global variable `unsigned i`.\n2. The program defines a function `fn2` that takes two unsigned integer parameters `p1` and `p2`. The function calculates the difference between `p1` and `p2` using the subtraction operator `p1 - p2` and returns the result.\n3. The program defines a function `fn3` that takes an unsigned integer parameter `p1`. Inside the function:\n   a. It declares an integer variable `int l`.\n   b. It declares a short variable `short m` and assigns it the value `0x809C`.\n   c. It checks the value of the global variable `i` using an `if` statement.

It uses an `if` statement to check the return value of `fn3`, but the body of the `if` statement is empty.\n\nStep 2: Optimization\nIn this program, the variable `l` is declared but not used after its initialization.
