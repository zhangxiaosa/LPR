In each iteration, it calls the `fn4` function with multiple nested function calls as arguments.\n   - The innermost function call is `fn3(4L, d)`, which passes the long integer literal `4L` and the value of `d` as arguments.\n   - The result of `fn3` is assigned to `v_00` using the assignment statement `v_00 = fn3(4L, d)`.\n   - The next function call is `fn2(v_00, 3)`, which passes the value of `v_00` and the integer literal `3` as arguments.\n   - The result of `fn2` is passed as the first argument to the outermost function call `fn4(...)`, along with the long integer literal `0x9EE7F9D1C772505BLL`.\n   - The result of `fn4` is assigned to `d`.\n8. After the `for` loop completes, the program prints the value of `v_00` as a hexadecimal number using `printf` with the format string `\"checksum = %X\\n\"`.\n9. The `main` function returns `0`.\n\nFrom the analysis, we can see that there is no redundant data type defined via `typedef` in this program. All the variables and function parameters use standard data types (`char` and `int`). Therefore, there is no need to substitute any data types.\n\nNext, let's write the final program into a JSON file:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"program\": \"#include <stdio.h>\\n\\nchar fn2(char p1, int p2) { return p1; }\\nint fn3(int p1, int p2) { return p2; }\\nint fn4(int p1, int p2) { return p1 + p2; }\\n\\nint u;\\nint v_00;\\n\\nint main() {\\n  int d = 2L;\\n\\n  for (; u < 51; ++u) {\\n    d = fn4(fn2(v_00 = fn3(4L, d), 3), 0x9EE7F9D1C772505BLL);\\n  }\\n\\n  printf(\\\"checksum = %X\\\\n\\\", v_00);\\n  return 0;\\n}\"\n}\n```\n\nThe program is written as a JSON object with a key-value pair.
