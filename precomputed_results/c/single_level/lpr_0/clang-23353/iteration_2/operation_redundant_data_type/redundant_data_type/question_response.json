Inside the loop, the function `fn1` is called with `p3` and `i` as arguments, and the return value is bitwise XOR'ed with `j_h`.\n8. The `&&` operator is used to perform logical AND operation with the result of `fn1(p3, i)` and `1`.\n9. The result of the logical AND operation is assigned back to `j_h` in each iteration.\n10.
