The program defines several global variables: `h`, `o`, and `p`.\n2. The program also defines several functions: `fn1`, `fn2`, `fn4`, and `fn5`.\n3. The `fn1` function takes two parameters, `p1` of type `unsigned` and `p2` of type `int`, and prints the value of `p1` using `printf`.\n4. The `fn2` function takes one parameter `p1` and assigns its value to the global variable `h`.\n5. The `fn4` function takes three parameters: `p1` of type `unsigned`, `p2` of type `char*`, and `p3` of type `int`. It calls the `fn2` function with the value of `p1`.\n6. The `fn5` function returns a `char` value. It declares and initializes variables `q`, `i`, and `s`. It also declares a variable `r` and assigns the value of the global variable `o` to it. The function then enters a nested loop, where it decrements `q` until its value is less than or equal to `s`. Finally, it assigns the value of `q` to the global variable `p` using the assignment operator `=`. However, the if statement `(p = q) ;` does nothing meaningful.\n7.
