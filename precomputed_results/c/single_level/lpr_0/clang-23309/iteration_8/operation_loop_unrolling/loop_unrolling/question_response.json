The program declares several variables: `p`, `v`, `w`, `ac`, `am`, and `an`. `p` is of type `unsigned`, `v` is of type `long`, `w` and `ac` are of type `short`, and `am` and `an` are of type `int`.\n3. `main()` is the entry point of the program.\n4.

After each iteration, `w` is decremented by 1.\n6. Inside the loop, `an` is assigned the value 250.\n7. An `if` condition checks whether `an` is equal to 250. If `an` is equal to 250, the condition evaluates to true, and the code block inside the `if` statement is executed.\n8.
