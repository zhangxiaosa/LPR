The program defines a struct named \"p\" with two members: \"ab\" of type int and \"q\" of type signed with a width of 22 bits.\n2. The program declares an unsigned integer variable \"u\" and an array of struct \"p\" named \"v\" with a size of 1. It also declares a struct \"p\" variable \"w\" and initializes it with values {0x1C87E74F, 816}.\n3. The program defines the main function.\n4. Inside the main function, a struct \"p\" variable \"a\" is declared and initialized with values {8L, 666}.\n5. The program enters a for loop that executes while \"u\" is less than or equal to 1. In each iteration, \"u\" is incremented by 1.\n6. Inside the for loop, the variable \"a\" is assigned the value of \"v[0]\" which is then assigned the value of \"w\". This effectively assigns the value of \"w\" to \"a\" and \"v[0]\" simultaneously.\n7. After the assignments, \"v[0]\" is assigned the value of \"a\", overwriting the previous assignment.\n8. The loop continues for one more iteration since \"u\" is incremented by 1.\n9. After the loop, the variable \"j\" is assigned the value of \"v[0].q\", accessing the \"q\" member of the struct \"p\" inside \"v[0]\".\n10. Finally, the program prints the value of \"j\" using the format string \"checksum = %X\", which interprets \"j\" as a hexadecimal value.\n\nThe redundant data type in this program is the typedef for the \"signed\" keyword with a width of 22 bits. To substitute every instance of this defined data type with its associated original data type, we need to replace \"signed\" with the actual data type it represents, which is \"int\". We also need to remove the width specifier \": 22\" since it is not necessary for the \"int\" type.\n\nModified program:\n\n```c\nunsigned j;\nstruct p {\n  int ab;\n  int q;\n};\nunsigned u;\nstruct p v[1];\nstruct p w = {0x1C87E74F, 816};\n\nint main() {\n  struct p a = {8L, 666};\n  \n  for (; u <= 1; u += 1) {\n    a = v[0] = w;\n    v[0] = a;\n  }\n  \n  j = v[0].q;\n  printf(\"checksum = %X\\n\", j);\n  \n  return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThe modified program removes the redundant typedef for \"signed\" and replaces it with \"int\" in the struct definition for \"p\".
