Loop unrolling is a compiler optimization technique that reduces loop overhead and improves performance by executing multiple loop iterations in each iteration.\n\nIn this case, the outer loop (`p2` loop) runs only once, and the inner loop (`u` loop) runs twice.

Optimize the loop using loop unrolling: Loop unrolling is a technique where the loop iterations are manually unfolded to reduce loop overhead. In this case, since the loop conditions don't contain any variable that changes during the loop execution, the loops are effectively infinite loops. To optimize them out, we can remove the loops completely.\n\n   The unrolled version of the loop would be:\n\n   ```cpp\n   a = v[0] = w;\n   v[0] = a;\n   a = v[0] = w;\n   v[0] = a;\n   ```\n\n   This eliminates the unnecessary loop iterations and assigns the same values to `a`, `v[0]` on each iteration.\n\n3.
