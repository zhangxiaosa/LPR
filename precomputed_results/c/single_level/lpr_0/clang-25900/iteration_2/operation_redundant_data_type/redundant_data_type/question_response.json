The program defines a function `fn1` that takes an unsigned integer `p1` and an integer `p2` as arguments and returns an integer. The return type of the function is `signed`.\n\n2. It defines a structure `m` with two bit fields `n` and `o`, both of type `signed`.\n\n3. It declares several variables: `r`, `s`, `t`, `u`, and `v`. `r` is of type `int`, `s` is a static variable of type `signed`, `t`, `u`, and `v` are of type `unsigned`.\n\n4. The `main` function begins with the declaration of a structure variable `ad` of type `m` and initializes it with `{1957}`.\n\n5. It calls the function `fn1` with arguments `v` and `5`. The return value is assigned to the `o` field of the structure `ad`.\n\n6. It declares a variable `ae` of type `signed` and initializes it with the value of `ad.o`.\n\n7. It declares a variable `af` of type `int` and initializes it with the value of `t`.\n\n8. It assigns the value of `ad.o` to the variable `ae`.\n\n9. It assigns the value of `u` to the `o` field of the structure `ad`.\n\n10. It calculates the value of `r` using the expressions `af % (~s / ae)`.\n\n11. The `ad.o;` statement has no effect and can be removed.\n\nTo substitute the redundant data type, the `signed` keyword used as a typedef in `typedef signed my_type;` needs to be replaced with the original data type.
