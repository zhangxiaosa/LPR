Inside `fn3`, there is a local variable `l` of type `b` and `m` of type `a` which are assigned specific values.\n6. There is a loop in `fn3` that iterates from 0 to 49 using the variable `n`.\n7. Inside the loop, there is a local variable `o` of type `d` and an `if` statement that checks the value of the global variable `i`.\n8. The `printf` statement is executed if `i` is nonzero.\n9. The value of `p1` is modified using the `fn2` function call.\n10. Finally, `p1` is returned from `fn3`.\n11. The `fn4` function is defined but does not return a value.\n12. The `main` function calls `fn4`.\n\nThe requested optimization is to inline a function other than the main function. In this case, we can inline the `fn3` function into the `fn4` function.
