The program defines a global variable `g` of type `int`.\n2. It defines the `main` function, which returns an `int`.\n3. In the `main` function, there are several local variable declarations:\n   - `i` of type `int`.\n   - `j` of type `int`, initialized with the hexadecimal value `0x24F96B7B`.\n   - `k` of type `unsigned int`.\n   - `f` of type `int`, declared in a `for` loop.\n   - `l` of type `int`, initialized with the long integer value `1L`.\n   - `m` of type `int`, initialized with the value of `j`.\n   - `o` of type `int`, initialized with the value of `g`.\n4. There are two nested `for` loops with empty bodies.\n5. There is a label `q` for a `goto` statement.\n6. Inside an `if` condition, the variable `k` is right-shifted by the value of `l`.\n7. The variable `i` is assigned the value of `o`.\n8. Inside the `if` condition, the variable `k` is left-shifted by the value of `m`.\n9.
