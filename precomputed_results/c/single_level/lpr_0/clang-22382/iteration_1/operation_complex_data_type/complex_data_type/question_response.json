The program declares a static function `fn1` which takes five parameters: `unsigned`, `short`, `unsigned`, `unsigned`, and `struct h`. This function returns a `struct h` value.\n\n4. The program defines a function `fn2` which takes a parameter `p1`. Inside this function, it declares a local variable `struct h p` and an integer variable `int q`.\n\n5.
