Next, a struct named `h` is defined with the following members:\n   - `signed i`\n   - `c j`\n   - `unsigned k`\n\n3. A variable `l` of type `d` (unsigned) is declared.\n\n4. There is a forward declaration of a function named `fn1`, which takes the following arguments:\n   - `f p1`\n   - `a p2`\n   - `g p3`\n   - `d p4`\n   - `struct h p5`\n\n5. Function `fn2` is defined with an argument `p1` of type `e` (unsigned). It declares a local struct variable `p` of type `h` and a local variable `q` of type `b` (int). The function calls `fn1` with arguments `q`, `l`, `p1`, `3`, and `p`.\n\n6. Inside `fn2`, there is an infinite loop (`for (;;)`), and within the loop, a local struct variable `r` is declared. The assignment `p = r = p` has no effect.\n\n7. The implementation of `fn1` follows, which takes the same arguments as declared earlier. It accesses the `k` member of the `p5` struct.\n\n8. The `fn1` function contains an unresolved label `w` and a `goto w` statement.\n\n9.
