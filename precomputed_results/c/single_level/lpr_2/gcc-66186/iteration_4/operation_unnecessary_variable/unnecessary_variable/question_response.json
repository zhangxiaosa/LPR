The program defines a global variable `int h`.\n2. The program declares a function `fn5()` that returns an `int`.\n3.

The function `fn5()` contains nested loops:\n   - The outer loop iterates over `p2` from 0 to 7 (inclusive) with a step of 1.\n   - The inner loop iterates over `p4` from 0 to 7 (inclusive) with a step of 1.\n   - Inside the inner loop, there is an `if` statement checking if `h` is less than 0.\n   - If the condition is true, there is another nested loop that iterates over `p4` from 0 to 7 (inclusive) with a step of 1.\n   - Inside the innermost loop, there is another `if` statement checking if the value at index `p3` of the array `ak` is non-zero.\n   - If the condition is true, the loop is terminated using the `break` statement.\n5.
