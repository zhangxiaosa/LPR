The program starts with the declaration of a variable `g` of type `int`.\n2. The `main()` function begins with the declaration of variables `i`, `j`, and `k`. `i` and `k` are of type `int` and `j` is of type `int` and initialized with the hexadecimal value `0x24F96B7B`.\n3. Inside the main function, there is a nested `for` loop. The outer loop declares a variable `f` of type `int`, but it is not initialized.\n4. The inner loop iterates as long as the variable `j` is non-zero, and it decrements `j` with each iteration.\n5. After the nested `for` loops, two more variables `l` and `m` are declared, both of type `int`. `l` is initialized with the value `1L`, indicating a long type.\n6. The variables `n` and `o` are declared and assigned the values of `g` and `n`, respectively. Both `n` and `o` are of type `int`.\n7. The variable `p` is declared as an `unsigned int` and is assigned the value of `o`.\n8. A label `q` is defined.\n9. The variable `k` is right-shifted by the value of `l`.\n10. The variable `i` is assigned the value of `p`.\n11. An `if` condition checks if `i` is non-zero.\n12. Inside the `if` block, the variable `k` is left-shifted by the value of `m`.\n13.
