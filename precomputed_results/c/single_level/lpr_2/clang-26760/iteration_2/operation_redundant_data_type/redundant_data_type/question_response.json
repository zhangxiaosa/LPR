The program defines a variable `g` of type `int`.\n2. The `main()` function begins.\n3. Inside the `main()` function, the program defines variables `i`, `j`, `k`, `l`, `m`, `n`, `o`, and `p`.

Inside the nested `for` loop, there is an inner loop that runs as long as `j` is non-zero. It decrements `j` in each iteration.\n6. After the loops, the program defines a variable `l` of type `int` and initializes it with the value `1L`, indicating that it is a `long` type value assigned to an `int` variable.\n7.
