Rename the existing `fn1()` function to `fn1_recursive()` to indicate that it's a recursive implementation and we will be creating a new version using loop unrolling.\n\n2. Create a new version of the `fn1()` function that will use loop unrolling. Let's call it `fn1()`.\n\n3. Replace the recursive call to `fn1_recursive()` within `fn1()` with a loop.\n\n4. Move the initialization of `h` outside the loop since it only needs to be set once.\n\n5. Replace the `goto` statement and label `i` with a conditional loop exit based on the value of `f.e`.\n\n6. Replace the initialization of `j` within the loop with a direct assignment to `j` before the loop.\n\n7. Remove the redundant call to `fn1()` after the loop.\n\n8.
