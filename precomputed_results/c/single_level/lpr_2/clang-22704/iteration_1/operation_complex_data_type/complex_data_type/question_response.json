Let's analyze the program and decompose the variables of this data type into variables of primary data types:\n\n1. The program starts with the declaration of an `int` variable `f`.\n\n2. Then, there is a function `fn1()` declared as `char`, which indicates that it returns a character.\n\n3. Inside the `fn1()` function, there is an `if` statement that checks the value of `f`. If `f` is non-zero, it jumps to the label `i`.\n\n4. If `f` is zero, the function `fn1()` recursively calls itself.\n\n5. After the recursive call, a `char` variable `j` is declared.\n\n6. The function returns the value of `j`.\n\n7. The label `i` assigns the value 6 (interpreted as a long integer) to the variable `f` and then calls `fn1()` again.\n\n8. After the recursive call, the variable `j` is assigned the value 0xEEACFBBF (interpreted as a long integer).\n\n9. Finally, the function `fn1()` returns the value of `j`.\n\n10. The `main()` function is declared as `int`, but it doesn't contain any code.\n\nTo summarize, the complex data type `fn1()` has two variables, `f` and `j`.
