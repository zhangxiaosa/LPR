The program defines a structure type `struct c` with two members `d` and `e`, both of type `int`.\n2. It declares a variable `f` of type `struct c`.\n3. It defines a function `fn1` that returns a `char`.\n4. Inside the `fn1` function, there is an `if` statement that checks the value of the member `e` of the variable `f`.\n5.

Inside the `fn1` function, there is a declaration of a variable `j` of type `char`.\n8. The function returns the value of `j`.\n9. The label `i` is defined, where the member `d` of the `f` variable is assigned the value `6L`.\n10. The `fn1` function is called recursively again.\n11.
