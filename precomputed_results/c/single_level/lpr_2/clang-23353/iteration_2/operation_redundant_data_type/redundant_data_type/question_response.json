The program declares three variables: `i` of type `int`, `j_h` of type `unsigned int`, and `p3` of type `char`.\n\n3. In the `main` function, a `for` loop is used to iterate `p3` from 6 to -7 (inclusive) with a decrement of 1 in each iteration.\n\n4. Inside the `for` loop, the function `fn1` is called with `p3` and `i` as arguments. The return value of `fn1` is bitwise AND-ed with `1L` and then XOR-ed with `j_h`, and the result is stored back into `j_h`.\n\nTo identify a redundant data type, we look for any data type defined by the programmer via typedef.

Inside the `for` loop, there is a statement that bitwise XORs the variable `j_h` with the result of the function `fn1` called with the arguments `p3` and `i`.
