Inside the loop, there is a local variable `ab` of type `int`.\n7. Inside the loop, there are three `if` statements with empty bodies. The conditions of these `if` statements involve function calls to `fn2`, `fn1`, and `fn3`.\n8. The loop also contains an `else if` statement with an empty body, which checks if `o` is less than or equal to `0xE3L`.\n9. Lastly, there is an `else if` statement that checks if `ab` is nonzero.
