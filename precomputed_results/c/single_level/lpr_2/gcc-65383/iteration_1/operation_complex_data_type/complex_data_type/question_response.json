The dimensions of the array are `[5][9][5]`.\n\n4. The type of the elements in the array is `int`.\n\n5. To decompose the array `r`, we need to create variables in primary data types that represent each element of the array. Since the dimensions are known, we can create variables for each index of the array.\n\n6. For example, we can decompose the array `r` into the following variables:\n\n   - `int r_0_0_0`\n   - `int r_0_0_1`\n   - ...\n   - `int r_0_0_4`\n   - `int r_0_1_0`\n   - `int r_0_1_1`\n   - ...\n   - `int r_4_8_3`\n   - `int r_4_8_4`\n\n7.
