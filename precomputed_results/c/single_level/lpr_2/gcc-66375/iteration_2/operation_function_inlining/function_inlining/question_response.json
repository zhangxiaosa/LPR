The function `fn2(char p1, int p2)` takes a character `p1` as input and returns it.\n3. The function `fn3(short p1, short p2)` takes two shorts as input and returns the second one (`p2`).\n4. The function `fn4(unsigned p1, unsigned p2)` takes two unsigned integers as input and returns their sum.\n5. Next, the program defines several global variables `p`, `t`, `u`, and `v[1][4]`.\n6.
