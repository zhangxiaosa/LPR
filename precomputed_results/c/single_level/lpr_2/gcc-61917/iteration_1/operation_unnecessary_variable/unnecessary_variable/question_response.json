It is assigned a new value within the nested loops using the expression `p1 = 0x4F - p1`. Finally, its value is checked in the expression `p1 || m[2][5]`.\n   - The variable `p2` is not used in the given program.\n   - The variable `k` is assigned a value of 0 within the nested loops. It is modified in each iteration using the `fn1` function with a fixed second argument of 6.
