Identify the variables:\n   - Global variables:\n     - `d` of type `int`\n     - `e` of type `int`\n   - Local variables:\n     - `j` of type `char`\n\n2. Analyze the control flow:\n   - The function `fn1` is defined, which returns a `char` value.\n   - Inside `fn1`, there is an `if` statement that checks the value of `e`.\n   - If `e` is false (0), the program jumps to the label `i`.\n   - If `e` is true (non-zero), the program continues executing the next statement.\n   - After the `if` statement, the function `fn1` is recursively called.\n   - Then, the variable `j` is declared, but its initialization value is not defined.\n   - Finally, `j` is returned.\n\n3. Perform constant propagation and copy propagation:\n   - Since `d` is assigned a constant value of `6` at the label `i`, we can replace the assignment statement `d = 6L;` with the constant value `6` throughout the program.\n   - Since `j` is not assigned a value before it is returned, we can remove the declaration and return statements related to `j` in the `if` block.\n\n4.
