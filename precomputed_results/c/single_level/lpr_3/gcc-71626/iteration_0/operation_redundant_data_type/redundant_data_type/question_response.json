The program starts with a typedef statement: `typedef long a;`. This defines the data type `a` as a synonym for `long`.

The program continues with another typedef statement: `typedef a d __attribute__((__vector_size__(sizeof(a))));`. This defines the data type `d` as an array of `a` elements, where the size of each element is determined by `sizeof(a)`.\n4. The program defines a function named `fn2` that returns a value of type `d`. Inside the function, a variable `c` of type `a` is declared and assigned the value `fn1`.
