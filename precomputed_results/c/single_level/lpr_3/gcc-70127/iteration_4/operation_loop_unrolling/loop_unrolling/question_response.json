The loop structure in the given program is as follows:\n   ```c\n   for (p2 = 0; p2 >= 0; p2 -= 1)\n     for (; u <= 1; u += 1) {\n       a = v[p2] = w;\n       v[p2] = a;\n     }\n   ```\n\n2. To optimize the loop using loop unrolling, we need to understand its behavior. The outer loop (`for (p2 = 0; p2 >= 0; p2 -= 1)`) runs indefinitely as long as `p2` is greater than or equal to 0. The inner loop (`for (; u <= 1; u += 1)`) runs as long as `u` is less than or equal to 1. The loop body assigns `w` to both `a` and `v[p2]`, and then assigns `a` back to `v[p2]`.\n\n3. Since the loop conditions do not change during the loop execution, we can unroll the loop to eliminate the repetitive check of loop conditions. We can manually unroll the loop as follows:\n   ```c\n   a = v[p2] = w;\n   v[p2] = a;\n   a = v[p2] = w;\n   v[p2] = a;\n   // Repeat the above two lines for each iteration of the inner loop\n   ```\n\n4.
