Variable `i` is declared as a static `d` and initialized with a hexadecimal value.\n4. The function `fn2` is defined as `signed` and returns a `signed` value.\n5.

If the value at index 2 of the `h` array is non-zero, the function returns `0xC3L`.\n8. Otherwise, the value at index `i` of the `r` array is assigned to the variable `g`.\n9. The `main` function calls the `fn2` function.\n10.
