Two variables `i` and `j` of type `struct c` are declared.\n\n3. The `main` function begins.\n\n4. A variable `l` of type `struct c` is declared and initialized with the values {24, 6738, 165}.\n\n5. A variable `m` of type `int` is declared and assigned the value of `j.e`.\n\n6. The value of `m` is assigned to `l.d`.\n\n7. A variable `n` of type `int` is declared and assigned the logical AND of `j.h` and `l.d`.\n\n8.
