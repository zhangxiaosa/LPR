Therefore, we won't inline this function.\n\n2. `fn4` function: This function contains a nested loop and an `if` condition.

Since these values are known at compile time, we can evaluate the `if` condition during compilation and optimize this function out via function inlining.\n\n3. `fn5` function: This function calls `fn4` and performs a check on its return value.
