The program begins with several typedef statements that define new data types:\n\n```c\ntypedef signed a;\ntypedef short b;\ntypedef int c;\ntypedef unsigned short e;\ntypedef unsigned f;\n```\n\n2. The program then declares two variables of type `c`:\n\n```c\nc g;\nc h;\n```\n\n3. Function `fn3` is declared which takes five parameters: `a, a, a, e, c`. This function returns a value of type `b`.\n\n```c\nb fn3(a, a, a, e, c);\n```\n\n4. Function `fn4` is declared which takes five parameters: `c, e, e, f, e`. This function returns a value of type `f`.\n\n```c\nf fn4(c, e, e, f, e);\n```\n\n5. Function `fn5` is defined, which returns a value of type `c`. It initializes three variables `o, s, u` and performs some computations.\n\n```c\nc fn5() {\n  f o = 0x5A683F60L;\n  c s = 0x57638FF4L;\n  f u = 0x30A04A8FL;\n  if (fn3(0x9A5DL, g, s, u, g))\n    ;\n  return o;\n}\n```\n\n6.

It declares a variable `ad` of type `c` and performs some computations.\n\n```c\nb fn3(a p1, a p2, a p3, e p4, c p5) {\n  c ad = -7L;\n  if (fn4(ad, 4294967287UL, ad, g, p5))\n    ;\n  return 0xA3L;\n}\n```\n\n7. Function `fn4` is defined, which returns a value of type `f`. It declares an array `ak` of type `b` and performs nested loops and conditional statements.\n\n```c\nf fn4(c p1, e p2, e p3, f p4, e p5) {\n  b ak[8];\n  for (p2 = 0; p2 <= 7; p2 += 1)\n    for (p4 = 0; p4 <= 7; p4 += 1)\n      if (h < 0)\n        for (p4 = 0; p4 <= 7; p4 += 1)\n          if (ak[p3])\n            break;\n  return g;\n}\n```\n\n8. The `main` function is defined as `int main()`, and it calls the `fn5` function.\n\n```c\nint main() { fn5(); }\n```\n\nTo identify the redundant data type and substitute every instance of it with its associated original data type, we need to determine if any of the typedefs are used elsewhere in the program. Upon analysis, we find that the typedef `a` is not used anywhere except as a parameter type in the `fn3` function.
