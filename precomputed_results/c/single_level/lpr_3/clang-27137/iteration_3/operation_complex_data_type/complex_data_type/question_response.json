The program declares two variables of primary data types: `char h` and `short o`.\n2. The `main()` function begins.\n3. Inside `main()`, a new variable `short q` is declared and initialized to the value of `o`.\n4. The program enters a `while` loop with the condition `q > 1`. This loop subtracts 1 from `q` repeatedly until `q` becomes less than or equal to 1.\n5. Steps 4 is repeated a total of six times.\n6. After the `while` loops, the value of `q` is assigned to `h`.\n7. The program prints the value of `h` as a hexadecimal number using `printf()` and the format specifier `%X`.\n8. The `main()` function returns 0, indicating successful program execution.\n\nThe complex data type in this program is not explicitly present. All the variables (`h`, `o`, and `q`) are of primary data types (`char` and `short`).
