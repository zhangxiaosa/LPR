Inner loop:\n   - `for (; j; --j)`\n      - The loop executes while `j` is non-zero. The loop body does nothing but decrement `j`.\n\n4.

The program ends.\n\nOptimization:\n\nBased on the analysis, we can observe that the variable `k` is not used before being assigned a new value. Therefore, we can optimize it out via copy propagation.
