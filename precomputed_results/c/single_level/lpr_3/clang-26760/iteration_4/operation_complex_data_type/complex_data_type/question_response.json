The program starts with the `main` function, which returns an integer.\n2. Inside the `main` function, the following variables are declared:\n   - `signed i`: This variable has the data type `signed int`.\n   - `int j = 0x24F96B7BL`: This variable has the data type `int` and is initialized with the hexadecimal value `0x24F96B7B`.\n   - `int f`: This variable has the data type `int`.\n   - `unsigned k`: This variable has the data type `unsigned int`.\n3. The program enters a nested loop structure with the outer loop's condition `f = 0`. As `f` is already initialized as `0`, the loop is never executed.\n4. Inside the nested loops, the variable `j` is decremented until it reaches `0` using the condition `--j`.\n5. After the nested loops, the variable `m` is assigned the value of `j`.\n6. The variable `i` is assigned the value of a variable `g` (which is not declared in the given code snippet).\n7. The program enters a labeled block `q`.\n8. The variable `k` is right-shifted by `1`.\n9. An `if` condition checks if `i` is non-zero. If `i` is non-zero, the code block within the `if` statement is executed.\n10. Inside the `if` block, the variable `k` is left-shifted by the value of `m`.\n11. The program jumps back to the label `q` using the `goto` statement.\n12. The program continues executing from label `q` and repeats steps 8-11 until the condition `i` becomes zero.\n\nTo decompose the complex data type into variables of primary data types, we need to identify the complex data type being used. In this program, there are no explicit complex data types such as structures, classes, arrays, or pointers.

The program starts with a variable declaration `signed g;` which indicates a variable named `g` of type `signed`. This is a primary data type.\n\n2. The `main()` function begins.\n\n3. Inside the `main()` function, there are several variable declarations:\n   - `signed i;` declares a variable named `i` of type `signed`, a primary data type.\n   - `int j = 0x24F96B7BL;` declares a variable named `j` of type `int` and initializes it with a hexadecimal value `0x24F96B7BL`. This is a primary data type.\n   - `int f;` declares a variable named `f` of type `int`, a primary data type.\n   - `unsigned k;` declares a variable named `k` of type `unsigned`, a primary data type.\n\n4. There is a nested `for` loop:\n   - The outer loop `for (f = 0;)` initializes `f` with 0.\n   - The inner loop `for (; j; --j)` decrements `j` until it becomes 0.\n\n5. After the nested `for` loops, there is a variable assignment `int m = j;` which declares a variable named `m` of type `int` and assigns it the value of `j`.\n\n6. There is a variable assignment `i = g;` which assigns the value of `g` to `i`. Both `i` and `g` are of type `signed`, which is a primary data type.\n\n7. There is a label `q:`.\n\n8. There is a bit shifting operation `k = k >> 1;` which shifts the bits of `k` to the right by 1 position.\n\n9. There is an `if` statement that checks if `i` is nonzero.\n   - If `i` is nonzero, the `if` block is executed.\n   - Inside the `if` block, there is a bit shifting operation `k = k << m;` which shifts the bits of `k` to the left by the value of `m`.\n   - After the bit shifting operation, there is a `goto q;` statement that jumps to the label `q:`.\n\n10.

Next, there is a nested `for` loop:\n   - `for (f = 0;)` initializes `f` to 0 and creates a loop with a condition that is always false. This loop will not execute.\n   - Inside the outer loop, there is another nested `for` loop: `for (; j; --j)`. This loop will keep decrementing the value of `j` until it becomes zero. Since the initial value of `j` is non-zero, this loop will execute multiple times.\n\n3. After the nested loops, there is the statement `int m = j;` which declares a variable named `m` of type `int` and assigns it the value of `j`.\n\n4. The statement `i = g;` assigns the value of `g` to the variable `i`. However, the variable `g` is not defined in the given code snippet, so it will result in a compilation error.\n\n5. Then, there is a label `q:` followed by the statement `k = k >> 1;`, which right-shifts the value of `k` by 1 bit.\n\n6. The `if` statement `if (i) { ... }` checks if the variable `i` is non-zero (true). If it is true, the following block of code will execute.\n   - Inside the `if` block, `k = k << m;` left-shifts the value of `k` by the value of `m`.\n   - The statement `goto q;` jumps to the label `q`, creating a loop.\n\nTo decompose the variables of a complex data type into primary data types, we need to identify the complex data type. In this program, there are no explicit complex data types like structures, classes, arrays, or pointers.
