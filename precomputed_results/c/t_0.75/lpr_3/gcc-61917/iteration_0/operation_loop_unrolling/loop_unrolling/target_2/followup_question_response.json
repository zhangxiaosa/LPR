Loop unrolling is a technique that reduces loop overhead by executing multiple loop iterations in a single iteration. In this case, we'll unroll the loop by a factor of 4.\n\nHere's the step-by-step analysis and modification:\n\n1. Declare a new variable `unrollFactor` and set it to 4. This represents the number of loop iterations we'll execute in a single iteration.\n\n2. Replace the original loop with the unrolled loop.\n\n   ```cpp\n   // Unrolled loop\n   for (k = 0; k >= -27; k = k - 24) {\n     p1 = o - p1;\n     p1 = o - p1;\n     p1 = o - p1;\n     p1 = o - p1;\n   }\n   ```\n\n   In each iteration of the unrolled loop, we execute four loop iterations by decrementing `k` by 24 instead of 6. Inside the loop body, we perform the operation `p1 = o - p1` four times.\n\n3. Adjust the loop termination condition.\n\n   Since we are executing four loop iterations in each iteration of the unrolled loop, we need to adjust the loop termination condition accordingly. In this case, the original termination condition `k >= -27` can be changed to `k >= -27 - 24 * (unrollFactor - 1)`.\n\n   ```cpp\n   // Unrolled loop with adjusted termination condition\n   for (k = 0; k >= -27 - 24 * (unrollFactor - 1); k = k - 24) {\n     p1 = o - p1;\n     p1 = o - p1;\n     p1 = o - p1;\n     p1 = o - p1;\n   }\n   ```\n\n4.
