Here's the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. Identify the loop to be unrolled: `while (1)`.\n2. Determine the number of iterations in each unrolled loop: Since the loop condition is `while (1)`, it means the loop will run indefinitely. Therefore, we need to decide on the number of unrolled iterations.\n3. Unroll the loop by duplicating its body multiple times, replacing the loop condition with a check for the desired number of iterations.\n4. Modify any loop variables or conditions that are affected by the unrolling.\n\nBased on the provided code snippet, it seems like the loop is intended to run indefinitely using `while (1)`. However, since optimizing out an infinite loop is not practical, we can assume a finite number of unrolled iterations for demonstration purposes.\n\nLet's assume we want to unroll the loop 3 times.
