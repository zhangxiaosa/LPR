In the `fn2` function, since the result of `fn1(p3, i)` is used in a bitwise XOR operation with `j_h`, we cannot replace `i` with its actual value using copy propagation.

The function `fn1` takes two `char` parameters `p1` and `p2` and returns their product.\n3. The function `fn2` takes three parameters: `int p1`, `unsigned *p2`, and `int p3`.
