The program declares a function named `fn1` with a return type of `short`.\n2.

The program then enters an `if` statement with the condition `if (j)`, which checks if the value of `j` is non-zero.\n4. If the condition is true, `j` is decremented by 1 (`--j`).\n5. The program then encounters a label `q`.\n6. The variable `k` is right-shifted by 1 bit (`k = k >> 1L`).\n7. The program enters another `if` statement with the condition `if (n)`, which checks if the value of `n` is non-zero.\n8. If the condition is true, `k` is left-shifted by the value of `j` (`k = k << j`) and the program jumps to the label `q` (using `goto q`).\n9. The program ends without returning any value from the `fn1` function.\n10. The program also declares a `main` function with a return type of `int`, but it doesn't contain any statements.\n\nTo decompose the program into variables with primary data types, we need to determine the primary data types for each variable.
