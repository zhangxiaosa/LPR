The target variable to be optimized is `j`.\n\n2. We start by analyzing the program to determine the values of `j` at different points.\n\n3. In the `fn1` function, `j` is initialized with the hexadecimal value `0x24F96B7BL`.\n\n4. The variable `n` is assigned the value of `g`.\n\n5. There is an `if` statement checking if `j` is non-zero. If true, `j` is decremented by 1.\n\n6. Next, there is a loop labeled `q`. Within the loop, the variable `k` is right-shifted by 1 bit.\n\n7. Inside the loop, there is another `if` statement checking if `n` is non-zero. If true, `k` is left-shifted by `j` bits and the loop `q` is executed again.\n\n8. The loop continues until `n` becomes zero.\n\n9. Since the `main` function is empty, it doesn't affect the value of `j`.\n\n10.
