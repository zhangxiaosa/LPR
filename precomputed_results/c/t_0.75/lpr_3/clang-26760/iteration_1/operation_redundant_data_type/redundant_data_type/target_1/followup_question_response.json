The function `fn1` returns a value of type `short`, which should be replaced with `int`. The function signature should be updated accordingly:\n```c\nint fn1() {\n```\n\n2. The variable `n` is declared as `short n = g;` and should be replaced with `int n = g;`.\n\n3. The variable `j` is declared as `int j = 0x24F96B7BL;` and does not need any changes.\n\n4. The variable `k` is declared as `unsigned k;` and does not need any changes.\n\n5. The `if` statement condition `if (j)` does not need any changes.\n\n6. The decrement operator `--j;` does not need any changes.\n\n7. The variable `l` is declared as `int l = 1L;` and does not need any changes.\n\n8. The variable `m` is declared as `int m = j;` and does not need any changes.\n\n9. The label `q:` does not need any changes.\n\n10. The line `k = k >> l;` does not need any changes.\n\n11.
