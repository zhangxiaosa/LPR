Here is the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. Since `l` is only assigned the value `1L` and never modified, we can replace all occurrences of `l` with the constant `1L`.\n\n2. After performing constant propagation, the program becomes:\n\n```c\nshort fn1() {\n  short n = g;\n  int j = 0x24F96B7BL;\n  unsigned k;\n  if (j)\n    --j;\n  int m = j;\n  unsigned p = n;\nq:;\n  k = k >> 1L;\n  n = p;\n  if (n) {\n    k = k << m;\n    goto q;\n  }\n}\nint main() {}\n```\n\n3. Since the variable `l` is no longer used, we can remove its declaration and assignment:\n\n```c\nshort fn1() {\n  short n = g;\n  int j = 0x24F96B7BL;\n  unsigned k;\n  if (j)\n    --j;\n  int m = j;\n  unsigned p = n;\nq:;\n  k = k >> 1L;\n  n = p;\n  if (n) {\n    k = k << m;\n    goto q;\n  }\n}\nint main() {}\n```\n\n4.
