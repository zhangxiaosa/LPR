Based on the provided code, the complex data type used is a structure named \"m\". \n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis and decomposition of the program:\n\n1. The program starts with a function declaration:\n```c\nunsigned fn1(unsigned p1, int p2) {\n  return p2;\n}\n```\nThis function takes two parameters, `p1` of type `unsigned` and `p2` of type `int`, and returns an `unsigned` value. We don't need to decompose this function further as the input and return types are already primitive data types.\n\n2. Next, there is a structure definition:\n```c\nstruct m {\n  int n : 18;\n  int o : 1;\n};\n```\nThis structure named `m` has two members, `n` and `o`, which are both of type `int` but have different bit-field widths. We can decompose this structure as follows:\n```c\nint m_n; // Decomposed member \"n\" of type int\nint m_o; // Decomposed member \"o\" of type int\n```\n\n3. After the structure definition, there are several variable declarations:\n```c\nunsigned q_l;\nint r;\nunsigned t;\nint u;\nunsigned v;\n```\nThese variables are already of primitive data types, so no decomposition is needed.\n\n4. Following the variable declarations, there is a function definition:\n```c\nint fn2(p3_l) {\n  struct m ad = {1957};\n  ad.o = fn1(v, 5);\n  int ae;\n  ae = ad.o;\n  ad.o = u;\n  r = t % (5 / ae);\n  ad.o;\n}\n```\nThis function takes an unspecified parameter `p3_l` of unknown data type and returns an `int` value. Let's assume `p3_l` is of type `int` for the purpose of decomposition. We can further decompose this function as follows:\n```c\nint fn2(int p3_l) {\n  int ad_n = 1957; // Decomposed member \"n\" of struct ad\n  int ad_o; // Decomposed member \"o\" of struct ad\n  ad_o = fn1(v, 5);\n  int ae;\n  ae = ad_o;\n  ad_o = u;\n  r = t % (5 / ae);\n  ad_o;\n}\n```\n\n5.
