The return type of the function is `signed`. Inside the function, there is a local struct variable `ad` of type `struct m`, initialized with a value of `{1957}`. There is also a local variable `ae` of type `signed`. The variable `af` is assigned the value of `t`, and `ae` is assigned the value of `ad.o`. Then, `ad.o` is assigned the value of `u`. Finally, the variable `r` is assigned the result of the expression `af % (~s / ae)`.\n\n12. Finally, there is the `main` function:\n    ```\n    int main() {\n      struct m z;\n      fn2(p, z, q, q, q.l);\n    }\n    ```\n    The `main` function has no parameters and returns an `int`.
