The target function to be optimized is `fn1`.\n2. `fn1` is called only once in the program, inside the function `fn3`.\n3. To inline `fn1`, we need to replace its call with the body of the function.\n4. The return value of `fn1` is assigned to `ad.o` inside `fn3`.\n5. The call to `fn1` can be replaced with the expression `p2`.\n6. After inlining `fn1`, the body of `fn3` will be modified accordingly.\n7. `ad.o = p2` will replace the line `ad.o = fn1(v, 5);`.\n8.
