The program includes the `<stdio.h>` header file.\n2. It defines an `unsigned` function `fn1` that takes two parameters `p1` and `p2` and returns `p2`.\n3. It defines a `struct m` with two fields `n` and `o`.\n4. It declares variables `p`, `q_l`, `r`, `t`, `u`, and `v`.\n5. It defines an `int` function `fn2` that takes a `struct m` parameter `p2` and an `unsigned` parameter `p3_l`.\n6. Inside `fn2`, it declares a `struct m` variable `ad` and initializes its `n` field to `1957`.\n7. It calls the `fn1` function with parameters `v` and `5` and assigns the result to `ad.o`.\n8. It declares an `int` variable `ae` and assigns `ad.o` to it.\n9. It assigns the value of `u` to `ad.o`.\n10. It calculates `t % (~(-5) / ae)` and assigns the result to `r`.\n11.
