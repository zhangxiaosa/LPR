The program defines an `unsigned` function `fn1` that takes an `unsigned` parameter `p1` and an `int` parameter `p2`. The function returns the value of `p2`.\n3. The program defines a structure `m` with two members: `n` of type `int` with a width of 18 bits, and `o` of type `int` with a width of 1 bit.\n4.
