The program defines a structure `struct h` with the following members:\n   - `signed i`\n   - `long j`\n   - `unsigned k`\n\n2. The program declares an unsigned integer variable `l`.\n\n3.

Inside the `fn1` function, there is a statement `p5.k;` that accesses the member `k` of the structure `p5`.\n\n5.
