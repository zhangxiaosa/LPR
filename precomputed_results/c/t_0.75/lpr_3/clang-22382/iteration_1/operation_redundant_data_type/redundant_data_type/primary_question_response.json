We start with the struct definition:\n\n```c\nstruct h {\n  int i;\n  long j;\n  int k;\n};\n```\n\nIn this case, the struct type `h` is defined by the programmer, so it is not redundant.\n\n2. Next, we move to the function `fn1`:\n\n```c\nstatic struct h fn1(unsigned p1, struct h p5) {\n  p5.k;\nw:\n  goto w;\n}\n```\n\nIn this function, the parameters `p1` and `p5` are defined with their respective data types, `unsigned` and `struct h`. These data types are not redundant.\n\n3. Moving on to the `fn2` function:\n\n```c\nunsigned fn2(p1) {\n  struct h p;\n  fn1(0, p);\n  for (;;) {\n    struct h r;\n    p = r = p;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe parameter `p1` in the `fn2` function does not have an explicit data type, which means it defaults to `int`. However, since it's not explicitly defined by the programmer, we can consider it redundant.\n\n4. Finally, we reach the `main` function:\n\n```c\nint main() {}\n```\n\nNo data types are defined within the `main` function.\n\nBased on the analysis, the redundant data type in the program is `p1`.
