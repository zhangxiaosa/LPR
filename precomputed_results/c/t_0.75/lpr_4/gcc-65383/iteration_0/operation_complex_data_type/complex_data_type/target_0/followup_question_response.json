Identify the type and size of `h`: `int h[]`\n   - `h` is an array of `int` type, but the size is not explicitly given.

Determine the number of elements in `h`: `{0x92A1D2CDL, 0x92A1D2CDL, 0x92A1D2CDL}`\n   - There are three initializer values in the array, so `h` has a size of 3.\n\n3.

The main target to be optimized is the variable `h`, which is an array of type `int` initialized with hexadecimal values.\n\n2.
