The `main` function begins.\n\n4. Inside the `main` function, a local variable `l` of type `c` is declared and initialized with the values `{24, 6738, 165}`.\n\n5. The `d` member of `l` is assigned the value of the `e` member of `j`.\n\n6. Another local variable `n` of type `int` is declared and initialized with the logical AND of the `h` member of `j` and the `d` member of `l`.\n\n7. The `g` member of `j` is assigned the result of a complex expression involving the `d`, `f`, and `h` members of `l` and `j`.\n\nIdentification of redundant data types:\n\nIn the given program, there are no redundant data types defined by the programmer via typedef.
