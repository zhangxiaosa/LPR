We start by looking for any user-defined data types using the `typedef` keyword. In this program, there are no `typedef` declarations, so we move on to the next step.\n\n2. Next, we examine the global variables and structures to identify any redundant data types. In the given program, we have a structure `struct { int d; int e; } f;`, which is a user-defined data type. However, since this structure is used only to define the variable `f`, and there are no other instances of this structure, we can consider it as redundant.\n\n3. Finally, we check the function declarations and function definitions for any redundant data types. In the program, there is a function `char fn1()`, but it does not define any new data types.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the only redundant data type in the given program is the structure used to define the variable `f`. Therefore, the JSON representation would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"target_list\": [\"struct { int d; int e; }\"]\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that the JSON representation may vary depending on the programming language or specific requirements of the analysis tool.
