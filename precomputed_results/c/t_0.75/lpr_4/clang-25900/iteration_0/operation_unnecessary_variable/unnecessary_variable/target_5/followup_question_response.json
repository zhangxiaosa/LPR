The variable `v` is declared as an unsigned integer.\n2. The function `fn1` takes two parameters, an unsigned integer `p1` and an integer `p2`, and returns an unsigned integer. In this program, `fn1` is called with `v` as the first argument and `5` as the second argument.\n3. The structure `m` is defined with two signed bit fields, `n` with 18 bits and `o` with 1 bit.\n4.
