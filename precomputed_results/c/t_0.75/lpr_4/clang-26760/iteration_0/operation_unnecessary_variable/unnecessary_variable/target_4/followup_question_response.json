The value of `g` is not known from the given code, so we cannot perform constant propagation in this case.\n\n4.

After performing constant propagation and copy propagation, the variable `n` is no longer used in the program. We can remove the declaration and initialization of `n`.\n\n3. The program can be simplified further by removing the unused variable `k` and the empty loops. Additionally, the variable `l` is initialized with the value `1L`, but it is never used. We can remove the declaration and initialization of `l` as well.\n\n4. The label `q` and the corresponding `goto` statement are unnecessary since they are not used.
