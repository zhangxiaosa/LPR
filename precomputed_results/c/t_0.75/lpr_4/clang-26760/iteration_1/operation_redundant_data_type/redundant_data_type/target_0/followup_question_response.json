The target data type to be optimized is `a`.\n\n2. `a` is defined as a `typedef signed a`, which means `a` is a signed data type.\n\n3. In the program, there are three instances of `a`:\n   - `a g;` - A variable `g` of type `a` is declared.\n   - `a i;` - A variable `i` of type `a` is declared.\n   - `i = g;` - The value of `g` is assigned to `i`.\n\n4. We need to substitute every instance of `a` with its associated original data type, which is `signed` in this case.\n\n5.
