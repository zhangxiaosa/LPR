The return value of `fn1` is not used, so we can replace the function call with the code of `fn1`.\n3. The code inside `fn1` is just an infinite loop labeled `w` with a `goto` statement, and it doesn't have any effect on the program's behavior.\n4.

Start by analyzing the `fn2` function:\n   - It declares a local variable `p` of type `struct h`.\n   - It calls `fn1` with arguments `3` and `p`.\n   - It enters an infinite loop using the `for (;;)`.\n   - Inside the loop, it declares a local variable `r` of type `struct h`.\n   - It assigns `p` to `r` and then assigns `r` back to `p`.\n\n2.

Replace the function call to `fn1` in `fn2` with the body of `fn1`:\n   - Replace the line `fn1(3, p);` with the contents of `fn1`:\n     ```cpp\n     p.k;\n   w:\n     goto w;\n     ```\n   - The resulting code for `fn2` after inlining `fn1`:\n     ```cpp\n     unsigned fn2() {\n       struct h p;\n       p.k;\n     w:\n       goto w;\n       for (;;) {\n         struct h r;\n         p = r = p;\n       }\n     }\n     ```\n\n4.

The function `fn1` takes an unsigned integer `p1` and a structure `p5` as parameters. However, the function body is empty, and it contains an infinite loop with a `goto` statement. As a result, the function doesn't perform any meaningful computation.\n\n2. The function `fn2` declares a structure `p` and calls `fn1` with the arguments 3 and `p`. However, the result of the function call is not used. After that, there's an infinite loop that assigns the uninitialized structure `r` to `p`.\n\n3. Since the function `fn1` doesn't perform any useful computation and the result of its call in `fn2` is not used, we can safely eliminate the function call to `fn1` and remove the `fn1` function altogether.\n\n4. Additionally, the infinite loop in `fn2` assigns an uninitialized structure `r` to `p` repeatedly. This loop doesn't serve any purpose and can also be removed.\n\n5.
