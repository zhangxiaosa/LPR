Here's the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. The program defines a struct named \"h\" with three members: \"i\" of type int, \"j\" of type long, and \"k\" of type int.\n2. The function \"fn1\" is declared as a static function that returns a struct h. It takes no parameters.\n3. The function \"fn2\" is defined as an unsigned function. It declares a struct h variable named \"p\" and an int variable named \"q\". It then calls \"fn1\" with three arguments: \"q\", the literal value 3, and \"p\".\n4. Inside an infinite loop, the function \"fn2\" declares a struct h variable named \"r\" and assigns \"p\" to \"r\", and then assigns \"r\" back to \"p\".\n5. The function \"fn1\" is defined as taking three unsigned parameters: \"p1\", \"p3\", and \"p5\". It accesses the member \"k\" of \"p5\" but does nothing with it. It contains a label \"w\" and a \"goto\" statement that jumps to the label \"w\".\n6. The \"main\" function is defined as an int function and has no statements.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only redundant data type defined by the programmer via typedef is \"struct h\".

The function `fn1` is declared as `static` and returns a struct of type `h`.\n\n3. The function `fn2` is defined as `unsigned` and has a struct variable `p` of type `h` and an `int` variable `q`.

Within the loop, a new struct variable `r` of type `h` is declared, and then `p` and `r` are assigned to each other.\n\n5. The function `fn1` is defined after `fn2`, which takes three parameters: `p1` and `p3` of type `unsigned` and `p5` of type `h`. It accesses the member `k` of `p5` but doesn't use it further.\n\n6.

However, the prototype of \"fn1\" is missing, so the compiler would raise an error for this.\n5.
