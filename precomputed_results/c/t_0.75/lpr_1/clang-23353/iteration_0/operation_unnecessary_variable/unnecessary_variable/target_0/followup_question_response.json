Since `i` is not used anywhere else in the program, it can be optimized out.\n\n2. In the `fn2` function, the variable `p2` of type `int*` is passed as an argument but is not used within the function. Therefore, it can also be optimized out.\n\n3. The `fn1` function takes two arguments of type `char` and returns their multiplication. However, it is not called anywhere in the program, so it can be optimized out as well.\n\n4. The variable `j_h` of type `signed int` is declared but not used in the program. It can also be optimized out.\n\nHaving performed the analysis, we can optimize the program by removing the unused variables and functions.

This means that the result of `fn1(p3, i)` is either 0 or 1, and it's being bitwise XORed with `j_h`.\n3. The `fn1` function multiplies `p1` and `p2` and returns the result as a `char`.\n4.
