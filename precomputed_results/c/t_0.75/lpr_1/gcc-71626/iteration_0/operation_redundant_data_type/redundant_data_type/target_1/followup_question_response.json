The program then includes another typedef statement `typedef a d __attribute__((__vector_size__(sizeof(a))));`, which creates a new type `d` as an alias for the `a` data type.

Assuming `c` should be of type `long`, we can modify the line to `long c = fn1;`.\n\n5. The variable `f` of type `d` is declared and initialized with the value of `c`.
