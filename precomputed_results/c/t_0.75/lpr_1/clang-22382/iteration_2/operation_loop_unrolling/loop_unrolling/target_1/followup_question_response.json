To optimize it out via loop unrolling, we'll replace the loop with a sequence of repeated statements.\n\nHere's the step-by-step analysis and optimization:\n\n1. The `goto w;` statement creates an infinite loop labeled as `w`. Since the loop is infinite, the program will continue executing the loop indefinitely.\n\n2. We can optimize out the `goto w;` statement by replacing it with a sequence of repeated statements that have the same effect as the loop. In this case, we can unroll the loop by duplicating the statements inside the loop.\n\n3. The statements inside the loop are:\n   - `struct H r;`: This declares a new struct `r` of type `H`.\n   - `p = r = p;`: This assigns the value of `p` to `r` and then assigns the value of `r` back to `p`.\n\n4. To unroll the loop, we can replace the loop with these repeated statements:\n   - `struct H r1;`: This declares a new struct `r1` of type `H`.\n   - `p = r1 = p;`: This assigns the value of `p` to `r1` and then assigns the value of `r1` back to `p`.\n   - `struct H r2;`: This declares a new struct `r2` of type `H`.\n   - `p = r2 = p;`: This assigns the value of `p` to `r2` and then assigns the value of `r2` back to `p`.\n   - ... (repeat the above two statements as needed)\n\n5. The number of repetitions depends on how many times the loop would have executed. Since the loop is infinite, we can choose any reasonable number of repetitions. For this analysis, let's assume we unroll the loop 10 times.\n\n6. After unrolling the loop 10 times, the optimized program becomes:\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nstruct H {\n  short i;\n  long j;\n  unsigned k;\n};\n\nstatic struct H fn1(struct H p5) {\n  p5.k;\nw:\n  goto w;\n}\n\nunsigned fn2() {\n  struct H p;\n  fn1(p);\n  \n  struct H r1;\n  p = r1 = p;\n  \n  struct H r2;\n  p = r2 = p;\n  \n  // Repeat the above two statements 8 more times\n  \n  return 0;\n}\n\nint main() {\n  unsigned result = fn2();\n  printf(\"Result: %u\\n\", result);\n  return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThe optimized program replaces the infinite loop with 10 repetitions of the statements inside the loop.
