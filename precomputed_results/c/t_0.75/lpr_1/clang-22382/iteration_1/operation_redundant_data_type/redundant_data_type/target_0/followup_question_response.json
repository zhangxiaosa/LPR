Identify all occurrences of the struct `h` type in the program.\n2. Replace each occurrence with its associated original data type, which is:\n   - `short` for `i`\n   - `long` for `j`\n   - `unsigned` for `k`\n3.

Replace all function signatures that use `struct h` as a parameter or return type with the corresponding original data types.\n   - `static struct h fn1(unsigned, short, struct h);` becomes `static unsigned fn1(unsigned, short, unsigned, long);`\n   - `unsigned fn2()` remains unchanged.\n   - `struct h fn1(unsigned p1, short p2, struct h p5)` becomes `unsigned fn1(unsigned p1, short p2, unsigned p5_i, long p5_j)`.\n5.
