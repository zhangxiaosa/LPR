Inside the function `fn1`, there are several statements:\n   - `c j = 0x24F96B7BL;`\n     It declares a variable `j` of type `c` (int) and initializes it with the hexadecimal value `0x24F96B7BL`.\n   - `unsigned k;`\n     It declares an unsigned variable `k` without initializing it.\n   - `for (unsigned f; f;)`\n     It declares an unsigned variable `f` without initializing it and starts a `for` loop that executes while `f` is non-zero.\n   - `for (; j; --j)`\n     It starts another `for` loop that executes while `j` is non-zero.
