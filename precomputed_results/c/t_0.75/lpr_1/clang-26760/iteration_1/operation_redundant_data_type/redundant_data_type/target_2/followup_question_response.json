The program starts with a typedef statement: `typedef int c;`. This statement defines `c` as an alias for the `int` data type.

There is a global variable declaration: `signed g;`. No changes are needed here.\n\n3. The program defines a function `short fn1()`. Inside this function, there are a few variables declared and used.\n\n   - Variable `j` is declared as `c j = 0x24F96B7BL;`. We need to replace `c` with `int`, so the declaration becomes `int j = 0x24F96B7BL;`.\n\n   - Variable `k` is declared as `unsigned k;`. No changes are needed here.\n\n   - There is an `if` statement: `if (j) --j;`. Since `j` is now of type `int`, no changes are needed here.\n\n   - Variable `m` is declared as `c m = j;`. We need to replace `c` with `int`, so the declaration becomes `int m = j;`.\n\n   - There is a label `q` followed by a block of code.
