The program starts with the declaration of the variable `g` as an `int`. This variable has a primary data type.\n\n2. Inside the `main()` function, the variable `j` is declared as an `int` and initialized with the value `0x24F96B7BL`, which is a hexadecimal value. `j` also has a primary data type.\n\n3. The variable `k` is declared as an `unsigned` integer, which is a primary data type.\n\n4. The program includes an `if` statement that checks the value of `j`. If `j` is not zero, `j` is decremented by 1.\n\n5. The program then enters a loop labeled `q`. Inside the loop, the variable `k` is right-shifted by 1 bit.\n\n6. Another `if` statement checks the value of the variable `g`. If `g` is not zero, the variable `k` is left-shifted by the value of `j`.\n\n7.

Let's assume `k` starts with the value `0`.\n\n- Replace the right-shift operation `k = k >> 1L;` with `k /= 2;`.
