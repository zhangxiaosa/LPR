Therefore, we can replace the function call `fn1(5)` with the constant value `5`.\n\n2. The variable `ad.o` is assigned the value of `fn1(5)`. Since we replaced the function call with a constant, we can replace `ad.o` with the constant `5`.\n\n3. After the optimization in step 2, the variable `ae` is assigned the value of `ad.o`, which is now `5`. Therefore, we can replace the assignment `ae = ad.o` with `ae = 5`.\n\n4.

In the `main` function:\n   - A variable `ad` of type `struct m` is declared and initialized with the value `1957` assigned to the `n` bit field.\n   - The `o` bit field of `ad` is assigned the result of calling `fn1` with the argument `5`.
