It declares variables `f`, `g`, and `fn1()` function.\n3. Inside the `fn1()` function:\n   - It declares variables `i`, `j`, `k`, `l`, `m`, `n`, `o`, `p`.\n   - It initializes `j` with a hexadecimal value.\n   - It enters a nested loop using variables `f` and `j`, but since `f` is initialized to 0, the loop will not execute.\n   - It initializes `l` with `1L`, which is a long integer.\n   - It assigns `j` to `m`.\n   - It assigns `g` to `n`.\n   - It assigns `n` to `o`.\n   - It assigns `o` to `p`.\n   - It enters a label `q` and performs right shift (`>>`) on `k` using `l`.\n   - It assigns `p` to `i`.\n   - It checks if `i` is nonzero and if so, it performs left shift (`<<`) on `k` using `m` and jumps back to label `q`.\n4.
