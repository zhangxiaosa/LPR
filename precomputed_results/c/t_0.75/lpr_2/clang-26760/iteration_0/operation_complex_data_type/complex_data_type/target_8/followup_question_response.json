Analyze the usage of variable `p` and determine the optimization approach.\n\n   In the given program, the optimization target is variable `p`. To optimize it, we need to analyze its usage and identify any opportunities for optimization. Based on the program code, the following observations can be made regarding the usage of `p`:\n\n   - `p` is assigned the value of `o`.\n   - `o` is assigned the value of `n`.\n   - `n` is assigned the value of `g`.\n   - `g` is a global variable, and its value is not modified within the `fn1()` function.\n   - `p` is used in the assignment `i = p`.\n   - `i` is used in the condition `if (i)`.\n\n   Since `g` is a constant value and `i` is used in a condition, the value of `p` can be optimized to a constant during compilation.\n\n3. Perform the optimization by replacing the variable `p` with its optimized constant value.\n\n   Based on the analysis, we can determine that the value of `p` can be replaced with a constant. Let's assume the optimized constant value for `p` is `0xABCD`. We need to modify the program as follows:\n\n   - Replace `e p = o;` with `e p = 0xABCD;`.\n\n4.
