The program defines a function `fn1` that takes two `char` parameters `p1` and `p2` and returns a `char` value. The body of the function multiplies `p1` and `p2` and returns the result.\n\n2. A struct `g` is defined, which has a single member `h` of type `signed`.\n\n3. An `int` variable `i` is declared.\n\n4. An instance of struct `g` named `j` is declared.\n\n5. The program defines a function `fn2` that takes three parameters: an `unsigned` integer `p1`, a pointer to `int` `p2`, and an `int` `p3`. The function returns a pointer to `int`.\n\n6. Inside the `fn2` function, there is a for loop that iterates from `6` to `-7` with a step size of `-7`. Within the loop, two bitwise operations are performed on `j.h` using the `fn1` function and the `i` variable.\n\n7. The `fn2` function returns the `p2` pointer.\n\n8. The `main` function is defined, which has no statements and simply returns `0`.\n\nTo eliminate the `int` data type and substitute it with its associated original data type, we need to replace the following occurrences:\n\n1. Replace `int` with `signed` for the variable `i`.\n2. Replace `int` with `struct g` for the variable `j`.\n3.
