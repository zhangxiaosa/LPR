The variable `p2` is passed as an argument to the function `fn1()` in the line `ad.o = fn1(5);`.\n2. Inside the function `fn1()`, the value of `p2` is returned without any modification.\n3. The returned value from `fn1()` is assigned to `ad.o` in the line `ad.o = fn1(5);`.\n4. The value of `ad.o` is assigned to the variable `ae` in the line `ae = ad.o;`.\n5. The value of `ae` is used in the expression `t % (~s / ae)` to calculate the value assigned to `r` in the line `r = t % (~s / ae);`.\n\nBased on the analysis, we can see that the variable `p2` is only used as an argument to the function `fn1()` and its return value is immediately assigned to `ad.o`. Therefore, we can optimize out the variable `p2` by replacing the function call `fn1(5)` with the constant `5`.
