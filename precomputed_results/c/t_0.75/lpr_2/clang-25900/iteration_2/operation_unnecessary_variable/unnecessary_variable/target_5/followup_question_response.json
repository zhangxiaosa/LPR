There are no constant values assigned to `t` directly.\n3. The expression `t % (~(-5) / ae)` involves `t`.\n\nNow, let's analyze the expression `t % (~(-5) / ae)`:\n\n- The constant `-5` is used in the expression.\n- The variable `ae` is assigned the value of `ad.o`, which is the result of calling `fn1(5)`.\n- The function `fn1(p2)` returns the value of `p2`.\n\nSince `t` is neither assigned a constant value nor used with a constant value in the expression, we cannot optimize it out using constant propagation.\n\nHowever, we can still optimize it out using copy propagation if `t` is not used anywhere else in the program. In this case, `t` is not used after the expression `r = t % (~(-5) / ae)`. Therefore, we can remove the declaration and initialization of `t` to optimize it out.\n\nHere's the final program after optimizing out `t` using copy propagation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"program\": \"int r;\\nstatic int s = -5L;\\nstruct m {\\n  int n : 18;\\n  int o : 1;\\n};\\nint fn1(p2) { return p2; }\\nint main() {\\n  struct m ad = {1957};\\n  ad.o = fn1(5);\\n  int ae;\\n  ae = ad.o;\\n  ad.o = ad.o;\\n  r = 0 % (~(-5) / ae);\\n  ad.o;\\n}\"\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that the program is provided as a JSON object, and the `program` key contains the modified code.
