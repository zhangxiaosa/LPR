Copy propagation can be applied to eliminate the assignment `ad.o = fn1(0, 5);`. The function call `fn1(0, 5)` returns the value of `p2`, which is 5. Therefore, the assignment can be simplified to `ad.o = 5;`.\n\n3. The assignment `ae = ad.o;` can be optimized out since the value of `ad.o` is not used later in the program.\n\n4. Constant propagation can be applied to simplify the expression `r = t % (~s / ae);`. The value of `s` is known to be -5, and the value of `ae` is known to be 5 (as assigned in the previous step). Therefore, the expression can be simplified to `r = t % (-5 / 5);` which further simplifies to `r = t % -1;`.\n\n5.
