Update the typedefs by replacing `e` with `unsigned` and `g` with `unsigned`.\n2. Replace the function return type `e` in `fn1` with `unsigned`.\n3. Replace the parameter type `e` in `fn1` with `unsigned`.\n4. Replace the variable declaration `struct m ad = {1957};` with `struct m ad = {1957u};` to ensure the initializer is of type `unsigned`.\n5. Replace the assignment statement `ad.o = fn1(v, 5);` with `ad.o = fn1(v, 5u);` to ensure the second argument is of type `unsigned`.\n6. Replace the variable declaration `unsigned t;` with `int t;` to match the original data type.\n7. Replace the variable declaration `unsigned v;` with `int v;` to match the original data type.\n8. Remove the variable declaration `unsigned t;` as it is no longer needed.\n9. Remove the variable declaration `unsigned v;` as it is no longer needed.\n10. Update the assignment statement `ad.o = u;` by casting `u` to `unsigned` as `ad.o = (unsigned)u;`.\n11.
