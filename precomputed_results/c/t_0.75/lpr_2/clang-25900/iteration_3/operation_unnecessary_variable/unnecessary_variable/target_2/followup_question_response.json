Since neither `t` nor `ae` have constant values assigned to them, we cannot propagate any constants into `r`. Therefore, we cannot optimize `r` using constant propagation.\n- Copy Propagation: The value of `r` is not assigned the value of any other variable, so we cannot optimize `r` using copy propagation.\n\nSince we cannot optimize `r` using constant propagation or copy propagation, the final program remains unchanged.
