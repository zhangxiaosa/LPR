Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. The variable `f_d` is declared at the global scope and is initially uninitialized.\n2. In the function `fn1()`, there is a conditional statement `if (f_e)` that checks the value of the variable `f_e`.\n3. If `f_e` is true (non-zero), the program jumps to the label `i`.\n4.
