Remove the static declaration from the `fn1` function since it is no longer used.\n3. The loop `for (;;) { ... }` in the `fn2` function seems to be an infinite loop, and it assigns `p` to `r` which has no effect. We can remove this loop if it is not necessary for the functionality of the program.\n4. Remove the unused `main` function.\n\nThe optimized program is as follows:\n\n```c\nstruct h {\n  int i;\n  long j;\n  int k;\n};\n\nunsigned fn2(p1) {\n  struct h p;\n  p.k;\nw:\n  goto w;\n}\n\n```\n\nHere is the final program in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"program\": \"struct h {\\n  int i;\\n  long j;\\n  int k;\\n};\\n\\nunsigned fn2(p1) {\\n  struct h p;\\n  p.k;\\nw:\\n  goto w;\\n}\"\n}\n```"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}, {"index": 1, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To optimize the program by function inlining, we need to replace the function call to `fn1` within `fn2` with the body of `fn1`.
