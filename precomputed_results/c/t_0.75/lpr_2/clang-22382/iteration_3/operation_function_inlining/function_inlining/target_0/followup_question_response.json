The `fn1` function is defined as follows:\n```c\nstatic struct h fn1(unsigned p1, struct h p5) {\n  p5.k;\nw:\n  goto w;\n}\n```\n   Since `fn1` is a static function and not used outside of the translation unit, we can safely remove it without affecting the program's behavior.\n3.

The function `fn1` is defined as a static function, which takes an unsigned integer `p1` and a struct `h` `p5` as parameters. It accesses the `k` member of `p5` but does not use it. Then it enters an infinite loop labeled `w`.\n3. The function `fn2` is defined as a function that takes an unsigned integer `p1` as a parameter. It declares a local variable `p` of type `struct h` and calls `fn1` with arguments `0` and `p`. Then it enters an infinite loop where it declares a local variable `r` of type `struct h` and assigns `p` to `r` and assigns `r` back to `p`.\n4.
