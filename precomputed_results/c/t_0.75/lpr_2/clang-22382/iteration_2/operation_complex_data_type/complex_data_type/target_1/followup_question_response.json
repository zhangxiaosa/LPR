The target variable to be optimized is `j`, which is a member of the struct `h`.\n2. The struct `h` has three members: `i` (integer), `j` (long), and `k` (integer).\n3. The program includes two functions: `fn1` and `fn2`, as well as the `main` function.\n4. The `fn1` function takes several parameters, including an instance of struct `h` (`p5`).\n5. The `fn2` function takes one parameter (`p1`), which is an unsigned integer.\n6. The `fn2` function calls the `fn1` function with specific arguments.\n7. Inside the `fn2` function, there is an infinite loop (`for (;;)`) where a local struct `h` variable (`r`) is assigned to the struct `h` variable `p`.\n8. The `main` function is empty.\n\nTo decompose the complex data type into variables with primary data types, we can declare separate variables for each member of the struct `h`.\n\nModified program:\n\n```c\nstruct h {\n  int i;\n  long j;\n  int k;\n};\n\nstatic long fn1(unsigned p1, short p2, unsigned p3, unsigned p4,\n                int p5_i, long p5_j, int p5_k) {\n  p5_k;\nw:\n  goto w;\n}\n\nunsigned fn2(unsigned p1) {\n  int p_i;\n  long p_j;\n  int p_k;\n  fn1(0, 0, p1, 3, p_i, p_j, p_k);\n  for (;;) {\n    int r_i;\n    long r_j;\n    int r_k;\n    p_i = r_i = p_i;\n    p_j = r_j = p_j;\n    p_k = r_k = p_k;\n  }\n}\n\nint main() {}\n```\n\nHere, the struct `h` is replaced with separate variables for each member: `p_i`, `p_j`, and `p_k`. The `fn1` function now takes individual arguments for each member of struct `h`. Similarly, the `fn2` function uses separate variables for each member of struct `h`, and the infinite loop assigns separate variables `r_i`, `r_j`, and `r_k` to `p_i`, `p_j`, and `p_k` respectively.\n\nFinal program in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"program\": \"struct h {\\n  int i;\\n  long j;\\n  int k;\\n};\\n\\nstatic long fn1(unsigned p1, short p2, unsigned p3, unsigned p4,\\n                int p5_i, long p5_j, int p5_k) {\\n  p5_k;\\nw:\\n  goto w;\\n}\\n\\nunsigned fn2(unsigned p1) {\\n  int p_i;\\n  long p_j;\\n  int p_k;\\n  fn1(0, 0, p1, 3, p_i, p_j, p_k);\\n  for (;;) {\\n    int r_i;\\n    long r_j;\\n    int r_k;\\n    p_i = r_i = p_i;\\n    p_j = r_j = p_j;\\n    p_k = r_k = p_k;\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nint main() {}\"\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that the JSON format is used to represent the final program.
