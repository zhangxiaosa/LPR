In this case, we are looking for data types defined by the programmer via typedef.\n\nHere is the step-by-step analysis of the program:\n\n1. The program defines two integer variables: `f_d` and `f_e`.\n2. It defines a function `char fn1()` that returns a character.\n3. Inside the `fn1()` function, there is an `if` statement that checks the value of `f_e`.\n4. If `f_e` is true, the program jumps to the label `i`.\n5. After the label `i`, the program assigns a long value to `f_d`.\n6. The program makes a recursive call to `fn1()`.\n7. Finally, the `fn1()` function returns a hexadecimal value `0xEEACFBBFL`.\n8. The program defines a `main()` function that returns an integer.\n\nBased on this analysis, there are no redundant data types defined in the program.
