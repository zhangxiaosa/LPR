The variable `f_e` is initially assigned the value 0.\n2. In the `fn1` function, there is a conditional statement `if (f_e)`, which checks if `f_e` is non-zero. If it is, the program jumps to the label `i`. Otherwise, it continues executing the next statement.\n3. After the conditional statement, there is a recursive call to `fn1()`. This means the `fn1` function will be called again with the same value of `f_e`.\n4. If the condition `if (f_e)` is false, the program reaches the `return` statement with the value `0xEEACFBBFL` and exits the function.\n5. If the condition `if (f_e)` is true, the program jumps to the label `i`. At `i`, the variable `f_d` is assigned the value 6.\n6. After assigning the value to `f_d`, `fn1()` is called recursively again.\n7.

The `if` statement in the `fn1` function checks the value of `f_e`. Since `f_e` is no longer present, we can remove the `if` statement and the corresponding `goto` statement.\n\n3.
