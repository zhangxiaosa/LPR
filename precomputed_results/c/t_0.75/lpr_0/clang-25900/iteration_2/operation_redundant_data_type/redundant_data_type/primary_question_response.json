The program defines a structure `m` that has two members: `n` of type `signed` and `o` of type `signed`.\n3. The program declares variables `r` (of type `int`), `s` (of type `signed`), `t` (of type `unsigned`), `u` (of type `int`), and `ad` (of type `struct m`).\n4. The program assigns the value 1957 to the member `n` of the structure `ad`.\n5. The program assigns the return value of `fn1(5)` to the member `o` of the structure `ad`.\n6. The program declares a variable `ae` of type `signed` and assigns the value of `ad.o` to it.\n7. The program assigns the value of `u` to the member `o` of the structure `ad`.\n8.
