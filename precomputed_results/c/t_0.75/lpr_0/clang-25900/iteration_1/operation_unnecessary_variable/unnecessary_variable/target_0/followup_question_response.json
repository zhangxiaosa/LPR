Since `s` is a static signed integer initialized with `-5`, `~s` will evaluate to `4`. Dividing `4` by `ae` (which is `5`) will yield `0` due to integer division. Therefore, `r` will be assigned with `0`.\n\n5.

Since `s` is a constant (-5) and `ae` is 5, the expression becomes `t % (~(-5) / 5)`, which simplifies to `t % (-6 / 5)`. Division of two negative integers results in a negative quotient, so `-6 / 5` is equal to -1. The expression simplifies further to `t % -1`, which is equivalent to `0`.\n\n4.
