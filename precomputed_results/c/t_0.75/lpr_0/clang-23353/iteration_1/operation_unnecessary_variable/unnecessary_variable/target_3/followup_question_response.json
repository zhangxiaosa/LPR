The target variable to be optimized is `p2` in the `fn2` function.\n2. Since `p2` is assigned the value of the `p2` parameter and returned at the end of the function, we need to determine if it can be optimized out.\n3. The `fn2` function does not modify the value of `p2`, so we can consider the possibility of constant propagation or copy propagation.\n4. However, the value of `p2` is not a constant, as it is a pointer to an `int` and can potentially refer to different memory locations.\n5. Since the value of `p2` is not a constant and it is not modified within the function, we cannot optimize it out using constant propagation or copy propagation.\n6.
