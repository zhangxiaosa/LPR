The program defines a struct named `h` with three members: `i` of type `int`, `j` of type `long`, and `k` of type `int`.\n2.

Inside `fn1`, there is an expression `p5.k;` which accesses the member `k` of the `p5` struct, but the result is not used.\n4. There is a label `w` and a `goto` statement `goto w;`, creating an infinite loop inside `fn1`.\n5.
