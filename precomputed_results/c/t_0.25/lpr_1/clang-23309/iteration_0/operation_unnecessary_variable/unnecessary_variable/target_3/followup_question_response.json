The condition `(ao - fn4(1L - an, 0xECL)) - p2 & 1UL` is evaluated.\n3. Since `ao` is a constant, the expression `(ao - fn4(1L - an, 0xECL))` can be simplified to `(0xBCD1L - fn4(1L - an, 0xECL))`.\n4. The function `fn4` always returns its first argument `p1`, so the expression can be further simplified to `(0xBCD1L - (1L - an))`.\n5. Simplifying the expression gives `(0xBCD1L - 1L + an)`, which can be rewritten as `(0xBCD0L + an)`.\n6. The expression `(0xBCD0L + an) - p2 & 1UL` can be simplified to `(0xBCD0L + an - p2) & 1UL`.\n7.

Start by analyzing the `fn10` function:\n   - The loop iterates three times, with `w` starting at 3 and decrementing by 1 each iteration.\n   - Inside the loop, there is an `if` condition checking if `an` is equal to `250UL`.\n   - If the condition is true, `p2` is assigned the result of `fn5(ab, ac) || (an = w) == 0x294A85636008822L`.\n   - There is another `if` condition that checks if `(ao - fn4(1L - an, 0xECL)) - p2 & 1UL` is non-zero.
