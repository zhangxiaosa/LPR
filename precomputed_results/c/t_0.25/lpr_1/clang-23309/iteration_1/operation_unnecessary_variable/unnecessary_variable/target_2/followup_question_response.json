The target variable to be optimized is `ao`.\n2. The variable `ao` is assigned the value `0xBCD1` inside the `if` statement.\n3. The `if` statement condition is `(ao - fn4(1 - an, 0xEC)) - p2 & 1`.\n4. The function `fn4` returns the value of `p1`, which is `1 - an`.\n5. The `if` statement condition can be simplified as `(0xBCD1 - (1 - an)) - p2 & 1`.\n6. Since `p2` is assigned the value `ac || (an = w) == 0x294A85636008822`, we need to analyze its value.\n7. The condition `an = w` assigns the value of `w` to `an`.\n8. The condition `(an = w) == 0x294A85636008822` checks if `an` is equal to `0x294A85636008822`.\n9. If `an` is equal to `0x294A85636008822`, `p2` will be assigned the value `1` (true) because `ac` is non-zero.\n10. If `an` is not equal to `0x294A85636008822`, `p2` will be assigned the value `0` (false) because `ac` is zero.\n11. The condition `(0xBCD1 - (1 - an)) - p2 & 1` can be simplified further based on the possible values of `p2`.\n12. If `p2` is `1`, the condition becomes `(0xBCD1 - (1 - an)) - 1 & 1`.\n13. If `p2` is `0`, the condition becomes `(0xBCD1 - (1 - an)) - 0 & 1`.\n14. Since `& 1` is a bitwise AND operation with `1`, it has no effect on the result.\n15. The condition can be further simplified as `(0xBCD1 - (1 - an)) - 1` or `(0xBCD1 - (1 - an)) - 0`.\n16. The value of `an` is assigned `250` inside the `if` statement condition.\n17. The condition `(0xBCD1 - (1 - 250)) - 1` can be simplified as `(0xBCD1 - (-249)) - 1`.\n18. Simplifying further, it becomes `(0xBCD1 + 249) - 1`.\n19.
