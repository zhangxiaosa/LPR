The program starts with two typedef statements:\n   - `typedef int c;` defines `c` as an alias for `int`.\n   - `typedef long d;` defines `d` as an alias for `long`.\n\n2. The program defines a function `fn1` that takes an argument `p2` and returns an `unsigned` value. The return type remains unchanged.\n\n3. The program defines a struct `m` with two bit fields `n` and `o`. Both bit fields are declared as `signed`. The bit field `n` has a width of 18 bits, and the bit field `o` has a width of 1 bit. The struct remains unchanged.\n\n4. The program declares variables `r` and `t` of type `c`, which is an alias for `int`. These variables will be substituted with `int` type.\n\n5. The program declares a static variable `s` of type `signed` and initializes it with the value `-5L`. The type remains unchanged.\n\n6. The program defines a function `fn4` that returns a value of type `d`, which is an alias for `long`. The function definition remains unchanged.\n\n7. Inside `fn4`, a variable `p2` of type `struct m` is declared and initialized with the value `{1957}`. The type remains unchanged.\n\n8. The program assigns the result of `fn1(5)` to the `o` field of `p2`. The return type of `fn1` is `unsigned`, which remains unchanged.\n\n9. The program declares a variable `ae` of type `signed` to store the value of `p2.o`. The type remains unchanged.\n\n10. The program assigns the value of `r` to the `o` field of `p2`. The type of `r` is `c`, which is an alias for `int`. It will be substituted with `int`.\n\n11. The program performs arithmetic operations using variables `t`, `s`, and `ae`. The types of `t` and `ae` are `c` (alias for `int`), and the type of `s` is `signed`. These types will be substituted with their original types.\n\n12. The program ends with an expression statement `p2.o;` which does not affect the type.\n\n13. The `main` function is defined as `int main() { fn4(); }`.
