The program starts with two typedef statements:\n   - `typedef int a;` defines `a` as an alias for `int`.\n   - `typedef char b;` defines `b` as an alias for `char`.\n\n2. Next, a struct named `c` is defined:\n   ```c\n   struct c {\n     a d;\n     a e;\n   };\n   ```\n   This struct has two members of type `a` named `d` and `e`.\n\n3.
