Inside the loop, the function `fn1` is called with `p3` and `i` as arguments, and the result is bitwise XORed with `j` and `1L`.\n4.

Since `p3` is not modified inside the loop, its value after the loop will be `-7`.\n7. The function `fn1` multiplies `p3` and `i` and returns the result. Since `p3` is `-7` and `i` is a global variable with an unknown value, we cannot perform constant propagation for this expression.\n8.
