The program enters a while loop that continues as long as `p` is non-zero:\n   - It performs a right shift operation on `k` by the value of `l`.\n   - It checks if `p` is non-zero and performs a left shift operation on `k` by the value of `j` if true.\n\nTo optimize the program by eliminating the `e` data type, we need to substitute every instance of `e` with `unsigned`.
