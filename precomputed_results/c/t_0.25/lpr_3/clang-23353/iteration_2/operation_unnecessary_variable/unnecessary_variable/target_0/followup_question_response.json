The variable `i` is declared as an `int`.\n4. In the `main` function:\n   - The variable `p3` is initialized with the value `6`.\n   - There is a loop that continues until `p3` is not equal to `-7`. In each iteration, `p3` is decremented by 1.\n   - Inside the loop, the bitwise XOR operation (`^=`) is performed between `h` and the result of `fn1(p3, i)` bitwise ANDed with `1L` (a long integer literal with the value `1`).\n   - Finally, the value of `h` is assigned to the variable `b`.\n\nTo optimize out the variable `b`, we can observe that `b` is assigned the value of `h`, which is the result of the XOR operation in each iteration of the loop.
