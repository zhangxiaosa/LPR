The variable `ad.o` is assigned the value returned by the function `fn1(t, 5)`. Since `fn1` returns `p2`, which is `5`, we can replace `ad.o = fn1(t, 5)` with `ad.o = 5`.\n\n3.

Since `u` is not initialized in the program, we cannot determine its value. Therefore, we cannot perform constant propagation here.\n\n5. The expression `t % (~s / ae)` involves the variables `t`, `s`, and `ae`. Since `ae` is a constant value of `5`, we can replace `ae` with `5`.
