Loop unrolling is a technique where multiple iterations of a loop are executed in a single iteration, reducing the overhead of loop control and improving performance. In this case, we can unroll the loop by a factor of 4.\n\nHere's the step-by-step analysis and modification of the program:\n\n1. Remove the target loop `for (; j; --j)`.\n\n2. Initialize a new variable `unroll_factor` with a value of 4.\n\n3. Modify the loop control variable `j` to decrement by `unroll_factor` in each iteration. Update the loop condition to `j >= unroll_factor`.\n\n4. Unroll the loop by manually executing the loop body 4 times in each iteration.\n\n5. Adjust the loop body to account for the unrolling. In this case, since the loop body is empty, no modifications are needed.\n\n6. Update the loop control variable `j` to decrement by `unroll_factor` in each iteration.
