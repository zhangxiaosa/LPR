Loop unrolling is a technique where multiple iterations of a loop are executed in a single iteration, reducing the overhead of loop control and improving performance. In this case, we can unroll the loop by a factor of `n`, where `n` is the number of times we want to repeat the loop body.\n\nHere's the step-by-step analysis and modification of the program:\n\n1. Identify the loop to be optimized: `for (; j; --j)`.\n2. Determine the number of times the loop body should be repeated. Let's assume we want to unroll the loop by a factor of 4, so the loop body will be repeated 4 times.\n3. Unroll the loop by repeating the loop body 4 times:\n\n```cpp\nfor (; j; --j) {\n  // Loop body\n  // Repeat the loop body 4 times\n  // ...\n  // ...\n  // ...\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n4. Replace the loop variable `j` with a new variable for each repetition of the loop body. Let's use `j0`, `j1`, `j2`, and `j3` as the new variables:\n\n```cpp\nfor (; j0; --j0) {\n  // Loop body\n  // ...\n}\n\nfor (; j1; --j1) {\n  // Loop body\n  // ...\n}\n\nfor (; j2; --j2) {\n  // Loop body\n  // ...\n}\n\nfor (; j3; --j3) {\n  // Loop body\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n5.
