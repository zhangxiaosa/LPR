Another typedef statement is encountered: `typedef a d __attribute__((__vector_size__(sizeof(a))));`. This creates a new type `d` which is an alias for `a` with a vector size attribute.\n\n4. The program defines a function named `fn2` which returns a value of type `d`. The function body contains the following statements:\n   - `a c = fn1;`: This declares a variable `c` of type `a` and assigns the address of the `fn1` function to it.\n   - `d f = {c};`: This declares a variable `f` of type `d` and initializes it with the value of `c`.\n   - `return f;`: This returns the value of `f` from the function.\n\n5.
