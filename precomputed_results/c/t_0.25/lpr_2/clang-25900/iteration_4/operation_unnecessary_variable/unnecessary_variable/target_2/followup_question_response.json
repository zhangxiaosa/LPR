The value of `ad.o` is assigned to the variable `ae` in the line `ae = ad.o;`. Since `ad.o` is the result of `fn1(5)`, which is now replaced with `5`, we can replace `ae = ad.o;` with `ae = 5;`.\n\n3. The value of `ad.o` is assigned 0 in the line `ad.o = 0;`. Since `ad.o` is not used later in the program, we can remove this assignment statement.\n\n4. The variable `ae` is used in the expression `t % (4 / ae)` in the line `r = t % (4 / ae);`. Since `ae` is now replaced with `5`, we can simplify the expression to `r = t % (4 / 5);`.\n\n5. The variable `ad.o` is mentioned in the line `ad.o;`, but it is not used in any meaningful way.
