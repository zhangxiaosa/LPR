Here is the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. The program starts with the declaration of two integer variables \"r\" and \"t\".\n2. Next, there is a definition of a struct \"m\" with two bit fields \"n\" and \"o\".\n3. The struct \"m\" is then initialized with the value 1957 for the \"n\" field.\n4. The \"o\" field of the struct \"ad\" is assigned the return value of the function \"fn1\" with argument 5.\n5. An integer variable \"ae\" is declared and assigned the value of the \"o\" field of the struct \"ad\".\n6. The \"o\" field of the struct \"ad\" is assigned the value 0.\n7. The variable \"r\" is assigned the result of the expression \"t % (4 / ae)\".\n8. The \"o\" field of the struct \"ad\" is accessed but not used.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only redundant data type is the struct \"m\".
