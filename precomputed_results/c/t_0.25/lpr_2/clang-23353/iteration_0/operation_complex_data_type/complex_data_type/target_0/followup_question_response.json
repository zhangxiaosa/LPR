Next, there is a struct declaration `struct g { int h; };` which defines a struct type `g` with a single member `h` of type `int`.\n\n3. After the struct declaration, there are two global variables declared: `int i;` and `struct g j;`. `i` is of type `int` and `j` is of type `struct g`.\n\n4.

It returns a pointer to an `int`.\n\n5. Inside the `fn2` function, there is a `for` loop that iterates from `p3 = 6` until `p3` is not equal to `-7`. In each iteration, the bitwise XOR operation `^=` is performed on `j.h` with the result of `fn1(p3, i) && 1L`. The result of the XOR operation is assigned back to `j.h`.\n\n6.
