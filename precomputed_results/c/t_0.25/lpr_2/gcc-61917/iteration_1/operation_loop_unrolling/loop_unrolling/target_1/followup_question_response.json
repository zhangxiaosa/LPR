Loop unrolling is a technique where we duplicate the loop body multiple times to reduce the overhead of loop control and improve performance.

Unroll the loop iteration 1:\n   ```c\n   // Unrolled loop iteration 1\n   for (; l; l++) {\n     for (k = 0; k >= -27; k = k - 6) {\n       p1 = o - p1;\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n   Unrolled iteration 1 becomes:\n   ```c\n   // Unrolled loop iteration 1\n   for (; l; l++) {\n     k = 0;\n     if (k >= -27) {\n       p1 = o - p1;\n     }\n     k = k - 6;\n     if (k >= -27) {\n       p1 = o - p1;\n     }\n     k = k - 6;\n     if (k >= -27) {\n       p1 = o - p1;\n     }\n     // Repeat the above two lines two more times\n   }\n   ```\n\n2.
