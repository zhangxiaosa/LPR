The `main` function is defined.\n5. Inside the `main` function, an infinite loop is created using `for (;;)`.\n6. Inside the loop, a 3-dimensional array `r` of integers is declared with dimensions 5x9x5.\n7. An `if` statement checks the value of `h2`. If `h2` is non-zero, the loop is terminated using `break`.\n8.
