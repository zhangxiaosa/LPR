The function `fn1(p2)` returns the value of `p2` without any modification. Since `p2` is a constant value of 5, we can replace the call `fn1(5)` with the constant value 5.\n\n2. The struct `m` is defined with two fields `n` and `o`. The field `n` is not used in the program, so it can be ignored.\n\n3. The variable `ad` of type `struct m` is declared and initialized with the value 1957 for the field `n`. The field `o` is not initialized explicitly.\n\n4. The statement `ad.o = fn1(5)` assigns the value returned by `fn1(5)` to the field `o` of `ad`. Since `fn1(5)` is replaced with the constant value 5, we can simplify this assignment to `ad.o = 5`.\n\n5. The variable `ae` is assigned the value of `ad.o`, which is 5. Since `ad.o` is a constant value, we can replace `ae` with the constant value 5.\n\n6. The statement `ad.o = u` assigns the value of `u` to the field `o` of `ad`. Since the value of `u` is not known, we cannot perform constant propagation or copy propagation for this assignment.\n\n7. The statement `r = t % (~s / ae)` assigns the result of the expression `t % (~s / ae)` to the variable `r`. Here, `t` is an unsigned variable, `s` is a signed variable with the value -5, and `ae` is a constant value of 5. Since `s` is a signed variable, the expression `~s` will perform bitwise negation on its binary representation. The expression `~s / ae` will divide the bitwise negation of `s` by the constant value 5. Finally, the expression `t % (~s / ae)` calculates the remainder of `t` divided by the result of the division. Since the values of `t` and `ae` are not known, we cannot perform constant propagation or copy propagation for this expression.\n\n8. The statement `ad.o` is a standalone expression that does not have any effect on the program.

The function `fn1(p2)` is called with the argument `5`, and its return value is assigned to `ad.o`.\n3. The value of `ad.o` is assigned to the variable `ae`.\n4.

Copy Propagation:\n   - The variable `r` is assigned the value of `t % (~s / ae)`.\n   - Since we know the constant values of `s` and `ae`, we can substitute them into the expression.\n   - `~s` is equivalent to 4 (bitwise complement of -5).\n   - `~s / ae` is equivalent to `4 / 5`, which is 0 (integer division).\n   - Therefore, `r` is assigned the value of `t % 0`.\n   - Any value modulo 0 is undefined, so we can remove the assignment to `r`.\n\n3.
