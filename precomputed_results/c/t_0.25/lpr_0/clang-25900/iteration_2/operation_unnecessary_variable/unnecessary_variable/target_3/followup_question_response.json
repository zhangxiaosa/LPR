Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:\n\n1. The variable `p2` is only used as the return value of the function `fn1`. Since `fn1` is a simple identity function that returns its input, we can replace all occurrences of `fn1(p2)` with just `p2`.\n\n2. The variable `p2` is not used anywhere else in the program.

Since `ae` is now a constant `5`, we can replace `~s / ae` with `~s / 5`. However, since `s` is a static variable with an unknown value (`-5L`), we cannot perform any further optimizations related to `r`.\n\n8.
