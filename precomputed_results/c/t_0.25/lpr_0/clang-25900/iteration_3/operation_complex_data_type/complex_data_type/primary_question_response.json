Both bit fields are of type int, but `n` is defined with a width of 18 bits, and `o` is defined with a width of 1 bit.\n\n3. Following the struct declaration, there are several variable declarations:\n   - `r` is an int.\n   - `s` is a static signed int initialized with the value -5L.\n   - `t` is an unsigned int.\n   - `u` is an int.\n\n4. After the variable declarations, there is a function `fn4` defined with a return type of long. Inside the function, there is a variable declaration for `ad`, which is a struct of type `m` initialized with the value 1957 for the `n` bit field.\n\n5. The `o` bit field of `ad` is assigned the result of calling the `fn1` function with the argument 5. The return value of `fn1` is implicitly converted to unsigned.\n\n6.
