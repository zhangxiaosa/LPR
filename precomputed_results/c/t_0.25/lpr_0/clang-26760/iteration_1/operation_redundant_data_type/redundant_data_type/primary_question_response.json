The program defines a global variable `g` of type `int`.\n2. The `main` function begins.\n3. Inside the `main` function, a local variable `j` is declared and initialized with the hexadecimal value `0x24F96B7BL`. The data type of `j` is `int`.\n4. Another local variable `k` is declared without an explicit initialization. The data type of `k` is `unsigned int`.\n5. An `if` statement checks the value of `j`. If `j` is non-zero, the following block of code is executed.\n6. Inside the `if` block, `j` is decremented by 1.\n7. A label `q` is defined.\n8. The value of `k` is right-shifted by 1 bit, and the result is assigned back to `k`. The data type of the shift count is `long`.\n9. Another `if` statement checks the value of `g`. If `g` is non-zero, the following block of code is executed.\n10. Inside the nested `if` block, the value of `k` is left-shifted by the value of `j`, and the result is assigned back to `k`.\n11.
