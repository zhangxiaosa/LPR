Initialize the worklist with variables: `i`, `j`, `k`, `l`, `m`, `n`, `o`, `p`.\n2. Start the iteration.\n3. For the variable `i`, it is not assigned a constant value or a copy of another variable, so we move to the next variable.\n4. For the variable `j`, it is not assigned a constant value or a copy of another variable.\n5. For the variable `k`, it is not assigned a constant value or a copy of another variable.\n6. For the variable `l`, it is assigned a constant value `1L`. Replace all occurrences of `l` with `1L`.\n7. For the variable `m`, it is a copy of `j`. Replace all occurrences of `m` with `j`.\n8. For the variable `n`, it is a copy of `g`. Replace all occurrences of `n` with `g`.\n9. For the variable `o`, it is a copy of `n`. Replace all occurrences of `o` with `g`.\n10. For the variable `p`, it is a copy of `o`. Replace all occurrences of `p` with `g`.\n11.
