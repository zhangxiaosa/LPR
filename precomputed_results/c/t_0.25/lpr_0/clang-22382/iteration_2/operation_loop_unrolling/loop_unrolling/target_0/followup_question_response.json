Loop unrolling is a technique that involves duplicating loop iterations to reduce the overhead of loop control.

The target loop `for (;;) {` is an infinite loop with no exit condition. Since it doesn't perform any useful computation, we can remove it entirely.\n\n2. The `fn2` function calls `fn1` with a `struct h` parameter `p`. However, the result of `fn1` is not used, and `p` is assigned the same value in each iteration of the loop. As a result, the `fn1` call and the assignment can be removed.\n\n3. The `main` function is empty and doesn't serve any purpose.
