Loop unrolling is a technique that involves duplicating loop iterations to reduce the overhead of loop control and improve performance.

The target loop is `for (;;) {`. Since it is an infinite loop, we can unroll it by manually duplicating the loop body multiple times.\n\n2. The loop body is `struct h r; p = r = p;`. We will duplicate this line multiple times based on the desired loop unrolling factor.\n\n3. Let's assume we want to unroll the loop 4 times. We will duplicate the loop body 4 times, resulting in the following modified code:\n\n```c\nunsigned fn2() {\n  struct h p;\n  fn1(0, p);\n  struct h r1;\n  p = r1 = p;\n  struct h r2;\n  p = r2 = p;\n  struct h r3;\n  p = r3 = p;\n  struct h r4;\n  p = r4 = p;\n}\n```\n\n4.
