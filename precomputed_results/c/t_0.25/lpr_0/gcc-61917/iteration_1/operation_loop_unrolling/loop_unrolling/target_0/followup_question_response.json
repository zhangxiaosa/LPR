In this case, the loop iterates as long as the value of `l` is non-zero and increments `l` after each iteration.\n\nTo perform loop unrolling, we can manually unroll the loop by duplicating its body multiple times. Since the loop condition is `l`, we can unroll the loop by a fixed number of iterations. Let's assume we want to unroll the loop 4 times.
