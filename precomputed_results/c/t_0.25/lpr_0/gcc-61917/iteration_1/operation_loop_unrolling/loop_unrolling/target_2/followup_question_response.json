Loop unrolling is a technique where we duplicate the loop body multiple times to reduce the number of iterations and improve performance. In this case, the target loop is `for (k = 0; k >= -27; k = k - 6)`.\n\nHere's the step-by-step analysis and optimization:\n\n1. The loop initializes `k` to 0.\n2. The loop condition checks if `k` is greater than or equal to -27.\n3. The loop updates `k` by subtracting 6 in each iteration.\n4. The loop body performs the operation `p1 = 0x4FL - p1`.\n\nTo optimize this loop using loop unrolling, we can unroll it by a factor of 5. This means we will duplicate the loop body 5 times, reducing the number of iterations from 5 to 1.\n\nOptimized loop:\n```c\nfor (k = 0; k >= -27; k = k - 6) {\n  p1 = 0x4FL - p1;\n  p1 = 0x4FL - p1;\n  p1 = 0x4FL - p1;\n  p1 = 0x4FL - p1;\n  p1 = 0x4FL - p1;\n}\n```\n\nThe optimized loop unrolls the original loop by performing the operation `p1 = 0x4FL - p1` five times in a single iteration.

Since the loop condition is `k >= -27` and the loop increment is `k = k - 6`, we can calculate the number of iterations required to cover the range from 0 to -27 with a step of -6.\n\nThe loop starts with `k = 0` and ends when `k` becomes less than -27. The step size is -6, so we can calculate the number of iterations as `(0 - (-27)) / (-6) + 1`, which simplifies to `5`.\n\nTherefore, we can unroll the loop by manually expanding it into 5 iterations.
