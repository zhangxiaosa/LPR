Finally, the value of `p` is printed using `printf()`.\n\nSince the variable `ae` is only used as the return value of `fn13()`, and its value is always `1UL`, we can optimize it out by replacing all occurrences of `ae` with `1UL`.

The `fn10` function is called with the variables `u` and `t` as arguments. However, the return value of `fn10` is not used, so we can ignore this function call.\n3. The `fn12` function is called with several arguments, including `am` and `an`. Inside the `if` condition, `an` is assigned the value `0` if `ac` is false. Since `ac` is initialized with `1L`, it is always true, and `an` is never assigned `0`. Therefore, the `if` condition is always false, and the subsequent code block is never executed.\n4. The value of `al` is assigned `3L` in the `fn12` function.\n5. The `fn13` function returns the value of `ae`, which is `1UL`.\n6. In the `main` function, the `fn13` function is called, but the return value is not used. We can ignore this function call.\n7. The value of `v` is assigned to `p`.\n8.
