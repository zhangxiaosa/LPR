In the `fn4` function, the variable `ad` is declared as a struct of type `m` and initialized with the value `{1957}`. This initialization is not a constant value, so we cannot propagate it.\n\n2. The field `ad.o` is assigned the result of the function `fn1(v, 5)`. Since `fn1` returns its second argument `p2`, we can replace `ad.o = fn1(v, 5)` with `ad.o = 5`.\n\n3. The variable `ae` is assigned the value of `ad.o`, which is `5`. We can replace `ae = ad.o` with `ae = 5`.\n\n4. The variable `af` is assigned the value of `t`. We cannot determine the value of `t` at compile-time, so we cannot propagate it.\n\n5. The expression `~s / ae` involves the variable `s` and the constant `ae` (which is `5`). Since `s` is a static variable with the value `-5L`, we can replace `~s / ae` with `~-5L / 5`.\n\n6. The expression `af % (~s / ae)` involves the variable `af` and the expression `~-5L / 5`. We cannot determine the value of `af` at compile-time, so we cannot propagate it.\n\n7. The statement `ad.o;` does not have any effect and can be removed.\n\n8. The variable `ad` is not used after the assignment `r = af % (~s / ae)`. We can remove the declaration and initialization of `ad`.\n\n9. The `fn4` function does not have a return statement, but since its return type is `d` (which is `long`), we can assume that the function returns a default value of `0` (or any other appropriate default value).\n\n10.

The variable `ae` is assigned the value of `ad.o`, which is now `5`.\n4. `ad.o` is assigned the value of `u`. We can replace `ad.o` with `u`.\n5. The expression `~s / ae` involves the bitwise complement of `s` and division by `ae`. Since `s` is a constant `-5L`, we can replace `~s` with `4` (bitwise complement of `-5L`), and the division becomes `4 / ae`.\n6.
