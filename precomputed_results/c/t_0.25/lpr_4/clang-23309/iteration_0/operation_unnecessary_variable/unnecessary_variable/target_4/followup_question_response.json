In the `fn10` function, the loop iterates three times, and the variable `an` is assigned the constant value 250 each time. Therefore, we can replace the condition `if (an = 250)` with `if (true)`.\n\n3. Inside the loop, the variable `p2` is assigned the value of `ac || (an = w) == 0x294A85636008822D`. Since `ac` is always 1 and `w` is decremented from 3 to 1 in the loop, the condition `(an = w) == 0x294A85636008822D` will always be false. Therefore, `p2` can be optimized to `ac`.\n\n4. The expression `(ao - fn4(1 - an, 0xEC)) - p2 & 1` is used in an `if` condition. Since `p2` is always 1 (as it is assigned the value of `ac`), the condition can be simplified to `(ao - fn4(1 - an, 0xEC)) & 1`.\n\n5. The variable `v` is assigned the value 1 if the condition `(ao - fn4(1 - an, 0xEC)) & 1` is true. However, since the value of `v` is not used later in the program, it can be optimized out.\n\n6. In the `main` function, the `fn10` function is called with arguments `u` and `t`. However, the return value of `fn10` is not used, so the function call can be optimized out.\n\n7. The value of `v` is assigned to the variable `p`. Since `v` is optimized out, the assignment can be removed.\n\n8. The value of `p` is printed using `printf`.
