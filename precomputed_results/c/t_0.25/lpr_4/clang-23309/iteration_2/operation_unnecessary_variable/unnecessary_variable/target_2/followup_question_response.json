Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:\n\n1. Initialize variables:\n   - `int v;` - `v` is initialized but not used in the program.\n   - `short w;` - `w` is initialized but not used in the program.\n   - `short ac = 1;` - `ac` is initialized with the value 1.\n\n2. Inside the `main` function:\n   - `int an;` - `an` is declared but not initialized.\n\n3. Start of the `for` loop:\n   - `for (w = 3; w; w -= 1)` - The loop initializes `w` with the value 3 and continues as long as `w` is non-zero. After each iteration, `w` is decremented by 1.\n\n4. Inside the `if` statement:\n   - `if (an = 250)` - Assigns the value 250 to `an` and enters the `if` block.\n\n5. Inside the nested `if` statement:\n   - `ac || (an = w);` - If `ac` is non-zero (true), the assignment `an = w` is skipped.\n\n6.

Print the value of `v`:\n   - `printf(\"checksum = %X\\n\", v);` - Prints the value of `v` as a hexadecimal number.\n\n9.
