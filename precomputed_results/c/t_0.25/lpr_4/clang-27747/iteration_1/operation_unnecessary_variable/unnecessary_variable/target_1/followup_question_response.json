Perform copy propagation.\n   - If neither `j.h` nor `l.d` can be determined as constants, check if there are any assignments to `l.d` before its usage in `n`.\n   - In this case, `l.d` is assigned the value of `j.e` before being used in `n`, so we can replace `l.d` with `j.e` in the expression `j.h && l.d`.\n   - The expression `j.h && l.d` can be simplified to `j.h && j.e`.\n\n4.

The program defines a struct `c` with members `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, and `h`.\n2. It declares two variables `i` and `j` of type `struct c`.\n3. In the `main()` function, a local variable `l` of type `struct c` is declared and initialized with values `{24, 6738, 165}`.\n4. The value of `j.e` is assigned to `l.d`.\n5.

Constant Propagation:\n   - Since `j.h` and `l.d` are both variables, we cannot perform constant propagation on the expression `j.h && l.d`.\n   - However, if either `j.h` or `l.d` is zero, the result of the AND operation will always be zero. We can optimize out `n` if we determine that either `j.h` or `l.d` is always zero.\n\n2.
