After the typedef statements, the program declares three variables:\n   - `c k;` declares a variable `k` of type `c` (which is an alias for `int`).\n   - `e l;` declares a variable `l` of type `e` (which is an alias for `unsigned`).\n   - `volatile f m[5][8];` declares a 2D array `m` of type `volatile f` (which is an alias for `volatile unsigned`).\n\n3.
