The program starts with two typedef statements:\n   - `typedef int a;` defines `a` as an alias for the `int` data type.\n   - `typedef char b;` defines `b` as an alias for the `char` data type.\n\n2. Next, a struct `c` is defined with two members of type `a`:\n   ```c\n   struct c {\n     a d;\n     a e;\n   };\n   ```\n\n3. An instance of struct `c` named `f` is declared:\n   ```c\n   struct c f;\n   ```\n\n4. The program defines a function `fn1` that returns a value of type `b`:\n   ```c\n   b fn1() {\n     // Function body\n   }\n   ```\n\n5. Inside the function `fn1`, a variable `h` of type `a` is declared and initialized with the value `6L`:\n   ```c\n   a h = 6L;\n   ```\n\n6.

Replace `typedef int a;` with `int a;`.\n2. Replace `a d;` and `a e;` inside the struct definition with `int d;` and `int e;`.\n3. Replace `a h = 6L;` with `int h = 6L;`.\n4.
