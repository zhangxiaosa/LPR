Inside the loop, there is an `if` statement that checks if `an` is equal to the constant value 250L.\n4. If the condition in the `if` statement is true, several operations are performed:\n   - The variable `t` is assigned the result of the logical OR operation between `ac` and the comparison `(an = w) == 0x294A85636008822DL`.\n   - The variable `ao` is assigned the value 0xBCD1L.\n   - The function `fn3` is called with arguments `ao` and the result of the function `fn4` called with arguments `1L - an` and `0xECL`.\n   - The result of the subtraction `fn3(...) - t` is bitwise ANDed with the constant value 1L.\n   - If the result of the bitwise AND operation is non-zero, the variable `p` is assigned the value 1L.\n5.
