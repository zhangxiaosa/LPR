The target variable to be optimized is `w`.\n2. The variable `w` is initialized to `3`.\n3. There is a `for` loop that iterates as long as `w` is non-zero.\n4. Inside the loop, there is an `if` statement with the condition `an = 250L`.\n5. If the condition is true, the variable `t` is assigned the value of `ac || (an = w) == 0x294A85636008822DL`.\n6. There is a local variable `ao` initialized to `0xBCD1L`.\n7. There is another `if` statement with the condition `fn2(fn3(ao, fn4(1L - an, 0xECL)), t) & 1L`.\n8. If the condition is true, the variable `p` is assigned the value `1L`.\n9. Finally, the value of `p` is printed as a hexadecimal number.\n\nTo optimize out the variable `w`, we need to analyze its usage and determine if it can be replaced with a constant or eliminated entirely.\n\n1. The variable `w` is used in the `for` loop condition `w = 3; w; w -= 1`. Since `w` is decremented by 1 in each iteration, it will eventually become zero and terminate the loop. However, the loop does not have any effect on the program's behavior or the value of `w` itself. Therefore, we can eliminate the loop and remove the usage of `w`.\n\n2. After removing the loop, the `if` statement `if (an = 250L)` becomes a simple assignment statement `an = 250L`. The value of `an` is assigned `250L`, but it is not used anywhere else in the program. Therefore, we can eliminate the assignment statement and remove the usage of `an`.\n\n3. The variable `t` is assigned the value of `ac || (an = w) == 0x294A85636008822DL`.

The variable `ao` is initialized to `0xBCD1L`, but it is not used anywhere else in the program. Therefore, we can eliminate the initialization statement and remove the usage of `ao`.\n\n5. The `if` statement `if (fn2(fn3(ao, fn4(1L - an, 0xECL)), t) & 1L)` is conditioned on the eliminated variables `ao` and `an`.
