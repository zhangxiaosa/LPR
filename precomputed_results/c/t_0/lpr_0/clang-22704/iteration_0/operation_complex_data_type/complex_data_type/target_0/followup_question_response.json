The program starts with two typedef statements:\n   - `typedef int a;` defines `a` as an alias for the `int` data type.\n   - `typedef char b;` defines `b` as an alias for the `char` data type.\n\n2. Next, a struct named `c` is defined:\n   ```c\n   struct c {\n     a d;\n     a e;\n   };\n   ```\n   This struct has two members of type `a` named `d` and `e`.\n\n3. An instance of the `c` struct named `f` is declared:\n   ```c\n   struct c f;\n   ```\n\n4.

Inside the `fn1` function, a variable `h` of type `a` is declared and initialized with the value `6L`:\n   ```c\n   a h = 6L;\n   ```\n\n6. An `if` statement checks the value of `f.e`.
