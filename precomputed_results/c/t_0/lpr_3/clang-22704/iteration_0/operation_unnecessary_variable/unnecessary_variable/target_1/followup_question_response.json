Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. The variable `f_e` is declared at the beginning of the program but is not assigned any value.\n2. Inside the `fn1` function, there is an `if` statement that checks the value of `f_e`.\n3. If `f_e` is true (non-zero), the program jumps to the label `i`.\n4. If `f_e` is false (zero), the program continues executing the next line, which is a recursive call to `fn1()`.\n5. After the recursive call, a local variable `j` is declared and assigned the value `0xEEACFBBFL`.\n6. The function `fn1` returns the value of `j`.\n7. The label `i` assigns the value of the local variable `h` to the global variable `f_d`.\n8. After the assignment, the program again calls `fn1()`.\n9.
