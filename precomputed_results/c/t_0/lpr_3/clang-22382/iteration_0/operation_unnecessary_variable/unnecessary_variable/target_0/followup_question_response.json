The program defines a struct `h` with members `i`, `j`, and `k`. The member `k` of struct `h` is accessed in the function `fn1`, but it does not affect the optimization of variable `e`.\n\n3. The program declares a variable `l` of type `d`. This variable is not used in any function, so it can be optimized out.\n\n4. The program defines a static function `fn1` that takes five parameters: `f`, `a`, `g`, `d`, and a struct `h`. The function does not use the parameter `f`, `a`, `g`, or `d`. It only accesses the member `k` of the struct `h` parameter, which does not affect the optimization of variable `e`. The function contains an infinite loop labeled `w` and a `goto` statement that jumps to the label `w`. This function does not affect the optimization of variable `e`.\n\n5.

The function calls `fn1` with arguments `q`, `l`, `p1`, `3`, and `p`. The return value of `fn1` is not used.
