The variable `p1` is not used outside the function `fn3`, so it can also be optimized out.\n\n3. The variable `p` is assigned the value of `v` at the end of the program.

Since `an` is not modified within the loop, we can propagate this constant value to the condition `an = 250U` in the `if` statement.\n\n5. The variable `ab` is assigned the result of the logical OR operation between `ac` and `(an = w) == 0x294A85636008822DLL`.
