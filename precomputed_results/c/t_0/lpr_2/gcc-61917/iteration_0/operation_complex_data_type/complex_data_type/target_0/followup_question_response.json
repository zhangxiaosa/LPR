Next, there are variable declarations:\n   - `c k;` declares a variable `k` of type `c` (which is an integer).\n   - `e l;` declares a variable `l` of type `e` (which is an unsigned integer).\n   - `volatile f m[5][8];` declares a volatile 2D array `m` of type `f` (which is an unsigned integer).\n\n3. The program defines a function `fn3` with a parameter `p1` of type `d` (which is an unsigned integer).\n   - Inside the function, there is a local variable declaration: `a o;` declares a variable `o` of type `a` (which is a signed integer).\n   - The function contains an infinite loop using `for (;;)`.\n\n4.
