Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:\n\n1. The variable `w` is initialized to the value 3.\n2. Inside the `for` loop, the condition `w` is checked. Since `w` is non-zero, the loop is executed.\n3. The `if` statement checks if `an` is equal to the constant value 250UL. If it is, the following code block is executed.\n4. Inside the `if` block, the variable `t` is assigned the result of the logical OR operation between `ac` and the comparison `(an = w) == 0x294A85636008822DLL`.
