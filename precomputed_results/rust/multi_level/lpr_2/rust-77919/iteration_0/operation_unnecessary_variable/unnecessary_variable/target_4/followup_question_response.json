Looking at the implementation of the `TypeVal` trait and the `struct Five`, we can see that `c` is a constant value of type `usize`. \n\nStep 2: Copy Propagation\nNext, we search for the uses of the variable `f` and replace them with its value `c`. In the given program, the only use of `f` is in the implementation of the `TypeVal` trait for the `b<e, f>` type where `e: TypeVal<c>`.
