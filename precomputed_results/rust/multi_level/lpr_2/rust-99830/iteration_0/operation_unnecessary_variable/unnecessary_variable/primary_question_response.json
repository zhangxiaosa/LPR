Import the `Primes` struct from the `primal_sieve` module and the `Add` and `MulAssign` traits from the `std::ops` module.\n2. Define the `main` function.\n3. Call the `a` function with the argument `4` and assert that the result is equal to `650`.\n4. Define the `a` function that takes a parameter `b` of type `u32` and returns a `u32`.\n5. Declare a mutable variable `c` of type `d` and initialize it with the result of the `d` function call with argument `1`.\n6. Call the `all` method on `Primes` to obtain an iterator of all prime numbers.\n7. Use the `take_while` method on the iterator to take elements while they are less than `b` (converted to `usize`).\n8. For each element `e` in the iterator:\n   1. Convert `e` to `u32`.\n   2. Calculate `f` by dividing `b` by `e`.\n   3. Multiply `c` by the result of the `pow` method called on `d(e)` with the argument `2 * f` and add `d(1)`.\n9. Return the value of field `0` of `c`.\n10. Define a `d` struct that holds a single field of type `u32`.\n11. Implement the `Add` trait for the `d` struct.\n12. Implement the `MulAssign` trait for the `d` struct.\n13. Define a constant `g` of type `u32` with the value `10^9`.\n14.
