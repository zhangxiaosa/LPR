The first expression is a block of code enclosed within curly braces `{ ... }`. We need to check if any functions are defined inside this block.\n4. Inside the block, the following code is present:\n   - `let j = 0;`\n   - `while 2 == 0 {}`\n   - `let mut l = 0;`\n   - `l |= 1 << j;`\n   - `4 as u64 * if l == 0 { 4 } else { 2 } % 5`\n5.
