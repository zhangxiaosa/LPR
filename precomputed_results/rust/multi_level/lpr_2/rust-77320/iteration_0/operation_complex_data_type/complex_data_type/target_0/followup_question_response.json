Define the constant variable `a` with the primary data type `isize` and initialize it with the value `10`.\n2. Define the constant variable `b` with the reference to `()` data type. The value of `b` is obtained by using the `std::mem::transmute` function to transmute the value of `a`.\n3. Declare a function `c` with no parameters.\n4. Inside the `c` function, we have a `match` statement that matches against a reference to `()` value.\n5. The `match` pattern `b` is used to match the value of `&()` against the value of `b`.\n   - If the matching succeeds, the value `9` is returned.\n\nTo optimize the `b` variable, we need to analyze the purpose and usage of `b` within the program. Since `b` is a constant variable assigned the result of the `std::mem::transmute` function, we should ensure that the transmutation operation is safe and the resulting `b` value is used correctly throughout the program.
