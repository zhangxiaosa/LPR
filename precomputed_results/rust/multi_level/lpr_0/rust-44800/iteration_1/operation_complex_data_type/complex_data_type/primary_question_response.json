The program imports the `VecDeque` type from the `std::collections` module.\n2. It defines a struct named `a` with a single field `c` of type `VecDeque<u8>`.\n3. The `main` function starts.\n4. It declares a mutable variable `k` of type `a` and initializes it with a new instance of `a`, where the `c` field is initialized with a `VecDeque` of capacity 18.\n5. It pushes the values 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, and 0 to the front of the `VecDeque` `k.c`.\n6. It declares a mutable variable `data` and initializes it with a new `Vec` of capacity 20.\n7. It pushes the binary value `0b1000_10_00` (136 in decimal), followed by the values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 55 to the `data` vector.\n8.
