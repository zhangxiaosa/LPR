Since the target variable, 4 % 5, is a constant expression, we can evaluate it to its result, which is 4.\n\n2. Copy propagation involves replacing a variable with the value it holds at a specific point in the program. In this case, the target variable is not assigned to any other variable or used elsewhere, so it can be optimized out.\n\n3.

Identify the target variable:\n   - Target: `4 % 5`\n\n3.

The variable `l` is assigned `4 * l` later in the program, so we can also perform copy propagation to replace `4` with the computed value `4 * l`:\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    let i = 2;\n    let mut l;\n    l = 1;\n    l = i * l;\n    let k = (l * l) % 5;  // Optimized: Replaced 4 with l * l\n    assert_eq!(k, 3);\n}\n```\n\n5.
