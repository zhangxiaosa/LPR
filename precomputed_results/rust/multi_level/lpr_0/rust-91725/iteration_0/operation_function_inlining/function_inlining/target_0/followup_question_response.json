Function `c` calculates the result of `(a * b) % d`, casting the intermediate result to `u32`.\n2. Function `e` takes three arguments `a`, `f`, and `m`. If `f` is equal to 0, it calls function `c` with arguments `a`, `a`, and `m` and returns the result. Otherwise, it returns `a`.\n3. Function `g` takes two arguments `h` and `arg`. It initializes variables `i` and `j` with the values 2 and 0 respectively.\n4. There is an infinite loop `while 2 == 0`, which will never exit. This code appears to be incorrect and may need correction.\n5. Variables `k` and `l` are created and assigned the values of `arg` and 0 respectively.\n6. Variable `l` is updated by performing a bitwise OR operation with the result of shifting 1 by `j` positions to the left.\n7. Function `e` is called with arguments `i`, `l`, and `h`, and the result is assigned back to variable `l`.\n8. Function `c` is called with arguments `k`, `l`, and `h`, and the result is assigned back to variable `k`.\n9. The final value of `k` is returned.\n\nTo optimize out the function `c` via function inlining, we need to replace the function call to `c` in the `e` function with the body of the `c` function directly.
