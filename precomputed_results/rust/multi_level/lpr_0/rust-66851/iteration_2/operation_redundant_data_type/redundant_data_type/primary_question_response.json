The program defines a function `main` that takes no arguments and returns nothing.\n2. Inside the `main` function:\n   - A constant variable `f` is defined and assigned the value `1 << 12`, which is the left shift of 1 by 12 bits.\n   - Two mutable variables `ac` and `ad` are defined as arrays with initial values. `ac` is an array of booleans with length `f as usize`, and `ad` is an array of `i32` with length `1 << 7`.\n   - Another mutable variable `o` is defined as a two-dimensional array of `i32` with dimensions `[16][2]`.\n   - The element at index `[1][0]` of `o` is assigned the value `std::i32::MAX`.\n   - A match expression is used to match the result of a function call `n` with multiple patterns:\n     - If the result matches the pattern `j::k(s)`, an assertion is performed using `assert_eq!` to compare `Some(s)` with `Some(20_313_839_404_245)`.\n     - If the result doesn't match any of the patterns, a panic occurs.\n3. An enum `j` is defined with three variants: `k` with a parameter of type `u64`, `l` with a parameter of type `i32`, and `m` with no parameters.\n4. A function `n` is defined with multiple parameters: `aa` of type `i32`, `o` of type `&[[i32; 2]]`, `p` of type `i32`, `q` of type `i32`, `ab` of type `i32`, `ac` of type `&mut [bool]`, and `ad` of type `&mut [i32]`.\n5. Inside the `n` function:\n   - An if statement checks if `ab` is equal to `aa`. If true, a series of operations are performed.\n     - A mutable string variable `ae` is defined.\n     - A for loop iterates over the range `(0..ab).rev()` and appends a string representation of `ad[1 << i]` to `ae`.\n     - If the string `ae` can be parsed as an `i32`, the result is wrapped in the `j::k` variant. Otherwise, the `j::m` variant is returned.\n   - If the condition of the if statement is false, the rest of the code is executed.\n     - A mutable variable `t` is defined and assigned the value `0`.\n     - The value of `t` is updated to the maximum of `o[2 + 1][1] - o[2 + 1][0]` and its current value.\n     - Another mutable variable `u` is defined and assigned the value of `t`.\n     - A while loop runs as long as `u` is less than `q`.\n       - Inside the loop, a mutable boolean variable `af` is defined and assigned the value `true`.\n       - A constant variable `ag` is defined and assigned the value `1 << ab`, which is the left shift of 1 by `ab` bits.\n       - Another mutable variable `ah` is defined and assigned the value `0`.\n       - A for loop iterates over the range `0..ag`.\n         - A variable `s` is defined and assigned the value of `ad[i] + u`.\n         - If the value at index `s as usize` of `ac` is true, `af` is set to false and the loop is terminated.\n         - The value `s` is stored at index `ag + i` of `ad`.\n         - The value `true` is stored at index `s as usize` of `ac`.\n         - The value of `ah` is incremented by `1`.\n       - If `af` is true, a series of operations are performed within the if statement block.\n         - A mutable variable `z` is defined as a two-dimensional array of `i32` with dimensions `[16][2]`.\n         - The element at index `[ab as usize + 2][0]` of `z` is assigned the value `std::i32::MAX`.\n         - A for loop iterates over the range `1..ab + 2`.\n           - The element at index `[i as usize][0]` of `z` is assigned the minimum value between `u + o[i as usize - 1][0]` and `o[i as usize][0]`.\n           - The element at index `[i as usize][1]` of `z` is assigned the maximum value between `u + o[i as usize - 1][1]` and `o[i as usize][1]`.\n         - A variable `af` is defined and assigned the return value of a recursive function call to `n` with updated parameters.\n         - A match expression is used to match the value of `af` with multiple patterns.\n           - If the value matches the pattern `j::k(_)` or `j::m`, the matched value is returned from the function.\n           - If the value matches the pattern `j::l(_)`, the code continues to execute.\n       - A for loop iterates over the range `0..ah`.\n         - The value `false` is stored at the index `ad[ag + i] as usize` of `ac`.\n       - The value of `u` is incremented by `1`.\n   - The function returns the `j::l` variant with the parameter `p`.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only redundant data type defined in the program is the enum `j`.
