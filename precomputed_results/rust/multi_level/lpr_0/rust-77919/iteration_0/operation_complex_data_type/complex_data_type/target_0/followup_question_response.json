The generic parameters `e` and `f` are not used in the program code snippet provided, so we can ignore them for now.\n3.

The type `b<Five, Five>` is used as a type parameter to access the constant `c` of that specific type, which will be used as the length of the array.\n\nStep 2: Decomposing into Variables with Primary Data Types\nTo decompose the program into variables with primary data types, we need to identify the primary data types used in the program. Based on the provided code, the primary data types are:\n\n- `usize`: The constant `c` in the `TypeVal` trait implementation is of type `usize`.\n\n- `Five`: The struct `Five` is defined explicitly.\n\n- `g`: The type `g` is not explicitly defined in the given code snippet, so we cannot determine its primary data type.\n\nTo optimize the target, which is `Five`, we can create a variable of `Five` and use it in the program.
