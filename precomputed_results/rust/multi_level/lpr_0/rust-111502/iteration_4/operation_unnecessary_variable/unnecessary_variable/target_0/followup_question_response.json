In the `f` function:\n   - The variable `i` is assigned the address of `d.1 .1` using `core::ptr::addr_of!`.\n   - `*i = 1.0` assigns the value `1.0` to the memory location pointed by `i`.\n   - `d` is returned but not used further.\n\n2.

Then, the value `1.0` is assigned to the memory location pointed by `i`. Finally, `d` is returned, and `d.1 .1` is printed in the `main` function.\n\nStep 2: Apply constant propagation\n\nSince the value of `i` is determined at compile-time and remains constant throughout the program, we can replace `i` with its constant value `1.0` wherever it is used.\n\nStep 3: Apply copy propagation\n\nAs `i` is assigned the constant value `1.0` and never modified afterwards, we can eliminate the variable `i` and directly assign `1.0` to `d.1 .1`.
