The program defines a function `c()` that takes no parameters and returns an `f64` value.\n2. Inside the `c()` function, there is an `unsafe` block that calls the `f()` function with an argument `(&mut 0.0, (0.0, 0.0))`. The `f()` function returns a `f64` value.\n3. The `f()` function is defined as an `unsafe` function that takes a parameter `d` of type `(*mut f64, (f64, f64))` and returns an `f64` value.\n4. Inside the `f()` function, there is a variable `i` that is assigned the result of `core::ptr::addr_of!(d.1 .1) as *mut f64`.\n5. The value pointed to by `i` is updated to `1.0` using the dereference operator `*i = 1.0`.\n6. The variable `d` is evaluated and its value is discarded (unused).\n7. The function returns the value of `d.1 .1`.\n8. Outside any function, the program defines the `main()` function.\n9. Inside the `main()` function, there is a call to `println!(\"{}\", c())`.\n10.
