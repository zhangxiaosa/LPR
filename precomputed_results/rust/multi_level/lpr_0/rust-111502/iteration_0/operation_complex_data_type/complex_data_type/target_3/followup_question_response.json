The main function calls the function `c()` and prints its result using the `println!` macro.\n2. Function `c()` has the return type `bool` and does the following steps:\n   a. Declares a mutable variable `a` with the initial value `(0., true)`. This variable has the complex data type `(f32, bool)`.\n   b. Declares a variable `b` with the initial value `(0., false)`. This variable also has the complex data type `(f32, bool)`.\n   c. Declares a variable `d` using the `addr_of_mut!` macro to get a mutable pointer to `a` and assigns it along with `b` to `d`. `d` has the complex data type `(*mut (f32, bool), (f32, bool))`.\n   d. Calls the function `f()` with `d.0`, `d`, `true`, and `true`. The result is assigned to the variable `e`.\n   e. Returns the value of `e`.\n3. The function `f()` is marked as `unsafe` and has the return type `bool`. It takes the following parameters:\n   a. A mutable pointer `k` to a tuple of type `(f32, bool)`.\n   b. A complex tuple `d` of type `(*mut (f32, bool), (f64, bool))`.\n   c. Two boolean parameters `g` and `h`.\n   The function does the following steps:\n   a. Declares a mutable pointer `i` and assigns the address of `d.1 .1` (the second element of the second element of `d`) to it. The pointer `i` has the type `*mut bool`.\n   b. Declares a boolean variable `j` and assigns the value of `g` to it.\n   c. Dereferences the pointer `i` and assigns the value of `j` to the pointed location.\n   d. The statement `d` has no effect since its result is not used.\n   e. Returns the value of `d.1 .1` (the second element of the second element of `d`).\n4.
