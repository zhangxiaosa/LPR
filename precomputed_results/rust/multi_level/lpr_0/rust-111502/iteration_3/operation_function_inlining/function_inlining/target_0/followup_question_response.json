The program has a function `c()` that returns a boolean value.\n2. Inside `c()`, a mutable variable `a` is declared and initialized to `0.0`.\n3.

The `unsafe` function `f()` takes a pointer to a tuple as an argument.\n5. Inside `f()`, a mutable pointer `i` is created by taking the address of the boolean value (`d.1 .1`) in the given tuple.\n6.
