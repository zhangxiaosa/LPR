To decompose it, we can create separate variables for each component of the complex data type.\n\nHere's the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. The program defines a function `c()` which returns an `f64` value.\n2. Inside the function `c()`, a mutable variable `a` of type `f64` is initialized with `0.0`.\n3. An unsafe block is used to call the function `f()` and pass a tuple `(&mut a, (0.0, 0.0))` as an argument.\n4. The function `f()` is an unsafe function that takes a complex data type `d` as an argument (`(*mut f64, (f64, f64))`) and returns an `f64`.\n5. Inside the function `f()`, a new variable `i` of type `*mut f64` is declared and assigned the memory address of `d.1 .1`, which is a nested component of `d`.\n6. The value `1.0` is then assigned to the dereferenced pointer `i`.\n7. The next line `d;` does not have any effect on the program logic and can be removed.\n8.
