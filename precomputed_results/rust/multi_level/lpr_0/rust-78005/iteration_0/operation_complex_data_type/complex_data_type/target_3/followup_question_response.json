The initial code defines a function called `main()`.\n\n2. There are several variable declarations inside the `main()` function with complex data types. The complex data type is represented as `typename < typename >`.\n\n3. To decompose the program into variables with primary data types, we need to replace the complex data types with their corresponding primary data types.\n\n4. The variable `x` is declared with different complex data types multiple times. We will decompose these declarations one by one:\n\n   a. `let x: isize < isize >;` - This declares `x` with the complex data type `isize < isize >`. We will decompose it as `let x: isize;`.\n\n   b. `let x: i8 < isize >;` - This declares `x` with the complex data type `i8 < isize >`. Since we want to optimize `x` to have the primary data type `i8`, we will keep this declaration as it is.\n\n   c. `let x: i16 < isize >;` - This declares `x` with the complex data type `i16 < isize >`. We will decompose it as `let x: i16;`.\n\n   d. `let x: i32 < isize >;` - This declares `x` with the complex data type `i32 < isize >`. We will decompose it as `let x: i32;`.\n\n   e. `let x: i64 < isize >;` - This declares `x` with the complex data type `i64 < isize >`. We will decompose it as `let x: i64;`.\n\n   f. `let x: usize < main >;` - This declares `x` with the complex data type `usize < main >`. We will decompose it as `let x: usize;`.\n\n   g. The remaining variable declarations (`let x;`) do not specify any data type. To decompose them, we need to assign primary data types based on their usage or context.\n\n      - Since we want to optimize `x` to have the primary data type `i8`, we can assign `let x: i8;` to the first remaining declaration.\n\n      - For the rest of the remaining declarations, we will assign them with `let x: i32;` to keep the program consistent. \n\n5. The final decomposed program will look like:\n\n   ```rust\n   fn main() {\n       let x: isize;\n       let x: i8;\n       let x: i16;\n       let x: i32;\n       let x: i64;\n       let x: usize;\n       let x: i8;\n       let x: i32;\n       let x: i32;\n       let x: i32;\n       let x: i32;\n       let x: i32;\n       let x: i32;\n       let x: i32;\n       let x: i32;\n       let x: i32;\n       let x: i32;\n       let x: i32;\n       let x: i32;\n       let x: i32;\n       let x: i32;\n       let x: i32;\n       let x: i32;\n       let x: i32;\n   }\n   ```\n\n6.
