Inlining a function means replacing a function call with the actual body of the function at the call site.\n\nLet's go through the program step by step:\n\n1. The `c` function is a simple arithmetic operation that can be inlined.\n\n2. The `e` function contains a conditional statement where if `f` is zero, it calls the `c` function. Otherwise, it returns `a`. Since `e` depends on `c`, we can inline both functions into the `g` function.\n\n3. The `g` function initializes variables `i` and `j`, followed by an infinite loop (`while 2 == 0 {}`). Since the loop is infinite and has no impact on the program logic, it can be removed.\n\n4. After the loop, the variable `k` is assigned the value of `arg`. Then, the variable `l` is initialized to 0 and bitwise ORed with `1` shifted by `j`. This can be simplified to `l = 1 << j`.\n\n5. The `e` function is called with arguments `i`, `l`, and `h`. Since we have decided to inline `e` into `g`, we can replace this line with the inlined body.\n\n6. Finally, the `c` function is called with arguments `k`, `l`, and `h`. We can also replace this line with the inlined body.\n\nBased on this analysis, here is the optimized program with function inlining:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"program\": \"fn g(h: u32, arg: u32) -> u32 {\\n    let i = 2;\\n    let j = 0;\\n    let mut k;\\n    k = arg;\\n    let mut l;\\n    l = 0;\\n    l |= 1 << j;\\n    let result = ((((k as u64 * (1 << j) as u64) % h as u64) as u32 as u64 * (1 << j) as u64) % h as u64) as u32;\\n    result\\n}\\n\\nfn main() {\\n    assert_eq!(g(5, 4), 3);\\n}\"\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that the code formatting may vary depending on the programming language and coding style.
