The program uses the generator feature from the standard library.\n2. The main function defines a mutable variable `d`, which is assigned a boxed closure that acts as a generator. This variable has a complex data type.\n3. Inside the closure, there are two yield statements that return string literals. These string literals are not stored in variables, so no additional complex data types are present.\n4. There is an unused variable `_e` of type String, but it is not a complex data type since it's a built-in type.\n5. The match expression uses the `resume` method on the generator `d`, but it doesn't introduce any new variables or complex data types.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only variable with a complex data type is `d`.

For each variable, check its data type.\n4. If the data type of the variable is a complex data type (e.g., structure, class, array, pointer), add its name to the `complex_data_types` list.\n5. After analyzing all the variable declarations, if no complex data types are found, return an empty list.\n6. Otherwise, create a JSON object with a key called `target_list` and assign it the `complex_data_types` list as its value.\n7.
