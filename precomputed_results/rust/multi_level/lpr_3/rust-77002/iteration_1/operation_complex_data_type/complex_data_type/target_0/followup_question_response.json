Inside the `f` function, a mutable array `l` of type `[i64; 4]` is defined and initialized with zeros using the syntax `[0i64; 4]`.\n\n3. A `for` loop iterates from `0` to `h-1`. On each iteration, the value at index `j` in array `b` is assigned to the corresponding index `j` in array `l`.\n\n4. The `f` function returns the value of `l`.\n\n5.
