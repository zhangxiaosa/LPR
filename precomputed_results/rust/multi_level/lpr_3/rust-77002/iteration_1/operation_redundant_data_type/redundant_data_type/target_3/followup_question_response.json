Based on the given program, the main function calls a function named `f` and passes several arguments to it.\n2. The `f` function takes five arguments: `a` and `b`, which are references to 2D arrays of type `[[i64; 4]]`, `n` of type `usize`, `g` of type `usize`, and `h` of type `usize`.\n3. Inside the `f` function, a mutable 2D array `l` of type `[[i64; 4]; 4]` is declared and initialized with zeros.\n4. A for loop iterates over the values from 0 to `h-1`, and inside the loop, the first element of the first row of `l` is assigned the value of the corresponding element from the first row of the array `b` (dereferenced using `(*b)[0][j]`).\n5. The function then returns the `l` array.\n6. The main function defines a constant named `p` of type `[[i64; 4]; 4]` and initializes it with a 2D array of size 4x4.\n7. Another mutable 2D array `l` of type `[[i64; 4]; 4]` is declared and initialized with a specific configuration.\n8. The `l` array is updated by calling the `f` function with arguments `&p`, `&l`, 4, 4, and 4.\n9. Finally, the content of the `l` array is printed.\n\nTo eliminate the `f` function and substitute its instances with the original data type, we need to:\n\n1. Remove the definition and implementation of the `f` function.\n2. Replace the function call `f(&p, &l, 4, 4, 4)` with the original logic of the `f` function, which includes the initialization of the 2D array `l` according to the modified line in the `f` function.\n3. Modify the function call to pass the constant `p` directly instead of a reference.\n4. Remove the unnecessary function arguments `4, 4, 4` from the function call.\n\nBelow is the modified program:\n\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    let mut l = [[1i64, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1]];\n\n    for j in 0..l[0].len() {\n        l[0][j] = p[0][j];\n    }\n\n    println!(\"{:?}\", l);\n}\n\nconst p: [[i64; 4]; 4] = [[0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1], [1, 2, 2, 2]];\n```\n\nThe optimized program substitutes the `f` function call with the original logic and removes unnecessary code related to the function.
