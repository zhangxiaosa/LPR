Let's analyze the program to understand its structure and dependencies:\n\n1. The `c` function initializes a mutable variable `a`, creates a mutable reference `d_0` pointing to `a`, declares another variable `d_3` with the value `false`, and then calls the `f` function with several arguments.\n2. The `f` function receives multiple arguments, including a mutable pointer `k`, a tuple `d`, two boolean values `g` and `h`. Inside the `f` function, the address of `d.3` is stored in a mutable pointer `i`. The value of `g` is stored in the memory location pointed to by `i`. Finally, the function returns the value of `d.3`.\n3. The `main` function simply calls the `c` function and prints its result.\n\nStep 2: Apply constant propagation and copy propagation\n\nSince we are specifically interested in optimizing the variable `j` in the `f` function, we focus on that part of the program. The value of `j` is initialized with the value of `g`.
