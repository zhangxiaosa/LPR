The value of `b` is assigned to the memory location pointed by `i`.\n7. The tuple `a` is evaluated as an expression but not used in any operation or assignment.\n8. The `f()` function returns the value of `a.2`, which represents the third element of the tuple `a`.\n9. The `main()` function is defined.\n10.
