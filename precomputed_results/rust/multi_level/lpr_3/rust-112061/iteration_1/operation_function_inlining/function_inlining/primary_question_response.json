There is a loop labeled as `'l0` that contains another loop.\n4. Inside the inner loop, there is a match statement that matches the value of `*v12` against different patterns.\n5. Depending on the matched pattern, different actions are performed including assignments, function calls, and control flow instructions (`continue` and `return`).\n6.
