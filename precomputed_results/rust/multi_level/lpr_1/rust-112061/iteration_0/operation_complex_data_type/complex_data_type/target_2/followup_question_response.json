The program imports the `std::ptr` module.\n\n2. The program defines an unsafe function `b` that returns a tuple containing three elements:\n   - An array of `u128` with length 7: `[u128; 7]`\n   - A mutable raw pointer to `i8`: `*mut i8`\n   - A mutable raw pointer to `bool`: `*mut bool`\n\n3. Inside the `b` function, several variables are declared with mutable bindings:\n   - `c` of type `bool`\n   - `v8` of an unspecified type\n   - `v9` of type `usize` initialized to 0\n   - `v12` of an unspecified type\n   - `d` of an unspecified type\n   - `v20` of type `[u8; 8]` initialized with default values\n   - `e` of an unspecified type\n   - `f` of type `(bool, u8)` initialized with default values\n   - `v33` of type `([u128; 7], *mut i8, *mut bool)` initialized with default values\n   - `v39` of type `(usize, [u128; 7], ([u32; 6], usize, *mut u32), [u32; 2])` initialized with default values\n   - `ret` of type `([u128; 7], *mut i8, *mut bool)` initialized with default values\n\n4. The third element of `ret` (tuple indexing starts from 0) is assigned the mutable address of `c` using the `std::ptr::addr_of_mut` function.\n\n5. The program enters an outer loop labeled `'l0`.\n\n6. Inside the outer loop, the mutable address of the element at index `v9` in `v20` is assigned to `v12` using the `std::ptr::addr_of_mut` function.\n\n7. The `v20` array is assigned a new array containing 8 elements, each initialized with the value `197_u8`.\n\n8. `v9` is assigned the value 2 of type `usize`.\n\n9. The program enters an inner loop.\n\n10. Inside the inner loop, a match expression is used to match the value pointed to by `v12`.\n\n11. If the value is `197`, a block of code is executed:\n    - `v8` is assigned the value `13978819448286864680_u64`.\n    - The third element of `v33` is assigned the value pointed to by the third element of `ret`.\n    - A match expression is used to match the value of `v39.0`.\n    - If `v39.0` is `0`, a labeled loop `'l2` is entered:\n      - The value pointed to by `v12` is assigned the value `22`.\n      - A loop is entered.\n      - Inside the loop, a match expression is used to match the value of `v8`.\n      - If `v8` is `13978819448286864680`, a block of code is executed:\n        - The first element of `v39.2` is assigned an array of 6 elements, each initialized with the value `2262110980_u32`.\n        - `v8` is assigned the value `13152832795211590855_u64`.\n        - `v39.0` is assigned the value `6`.\n        - `d` is assigned the value pointed to by `v33.2`.\n        - The value pointed to by `v33.2` is assigned the mutable address of `f.0`.\n        - The second element of `f` is assigned the value pointed to by `v12`.\n        - The value pointed to by `d` is assigned `true`.\n        - `v20` is assigned the value of `e`.\n        - A match expression is used to match the value of `v39.0`.\n        - If `v39.0` is `6`, a `println!` statement is executed, printing the value of `f`.\n        - If `v39.0` is `0`, the `'l2` labeled loop continues.\n        - Otherwise, the `b` function returns the value of `ret`.\n      - Otherwise, the `'l0` labeled loop continues.\n    - Otherwise, the `b` function returns the value of `ret`.\n\n12. If the value pointed to by `v12` is `4`, the mutable address of the element at index `v9` in `v20` is assigned to `v12`.\n\n13. Otherwise, the `b` function returns the value of `ret`.\n\n14. The `main` function is defined.\n\n15. Inside the `main` function, an unsafe block is entered.\n\n16. Inside the unsafe block, the `b` function is called.\n\n17.
