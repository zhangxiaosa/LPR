The program defines a constant `p` of type `[[i64; 4]; 4]`, which is a 2D array of 64-bit integers with dimensions 4x4. It is initialized with the specified values.\n2. It declares a mutable variable `l` of type `[i64; 4]`, which is an array of 64-bit integers with length 4. It is initialized with the values `[0, 1, 0, 0]`.\n3. Inside a nested scope, it declares a variable `a` and assigns it a reference to the first element of `p` (`&p[0]`), which is an array of 64-bit integers.\n4. It also declares a variable `b` and assigns it a reference to `l`, which is an array of 64-bit integers.\n5. It declares three variables `_n`, `_g`, and `_h`, each with the value 4. These variables do not seem to be used in the code.\n6. It declares a mutable variable `result` of type `[i64; 4]` and initializes it with `[0, 0, 0, 0]`.\n7. It assigns the value of `b[1]` (the second element of `b`) to `result[0]`.\n8. It assigns the value of `result` to `l`, updating the value of `l` to `[1, 0, 0, 0]`.\n9. It prints the value of `l` using the `println!` macro.\n\nTo decompose the program into variables with primary data types, we can analyze the types of the variables used and their assignments:\n\n1. p: [[i64; 4]; 4] -> 2D array of 64-bit integers\n2. l: [i64; 4] -> array of 64-bit integers\n3. a: &[i64; 4] -> reference to an array of 64-bit integers\n4. b: &[i64; 4] -> reference to an array of 64-bit integers\n5. _n: i64 -> 64-bit integer\n6. _g: i64 -> 64-bit integer\n7. _h: i64 -> 64-bit integer\n8. result: [i64; 4] -> array of 64-bit integers\n\nConsidering the target optimization of `l`, we can keep the decomposed variables of primary data types while tracking their values through each step of the program.
