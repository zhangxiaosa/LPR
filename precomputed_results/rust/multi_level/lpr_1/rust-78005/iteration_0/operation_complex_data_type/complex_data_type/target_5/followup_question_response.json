The program starts with the function declaration `fn main()` and ends with the closing curly brace `}`.\n2. Inside the function, there are a series of variable declarations using the `let` keyword.\n3. Each variable declaration consists of the variable name (`x`) followed by a colon (`:`) and the variable's data type.\n4. The variables have complex data types specified in the format `<Type1 <Type2>>`, where `Type1` is the primary data type and `Type2` is the type parameter.\n5. The first variable declaration `let x: isize < isize >;` specifies `isize` as the primary data type and `isize` as the type parameter.\n6. The next variable declarations follow a similar pattern, specifying different primary data types and type parameters: `i8 < isize >`, `i16 < isize >`, `i32 < isize >`, `i64 < isize >`, `usize < main >`.\n7. After that, there are multiple variable declarations without explicit data types, simply `let x;`. These variables will have their types inferred based on usage or remain untyped.\n8. The final step in the program is closing the main function with the closing curly brace `}`.\n\nBased on the target to be optimized `x: usize<main>`, it seems we want to focus on the variable `x` with the type `usize<main>`.
