Identify the target function to be optimized, which is `main`.\n\n2. Remove duplicate variable declarations to improve code clarity and eliminate redundancy. In this case, there are multiple declarations of the variable `x`, so we'll keep only one.\n\n3. Expand the data type annotations for better readability. The current code specifies type annotations using angle brackets, such as `<isize>`. Instead, we'll use the `:` operator to annotate the types explicitly.\n\n4. The code contains a variable declaration `x: usize<main>;` which seems to have an incorrect type. We'll remove this line since it doesn't make sense.\n\n5.
