The program defines a generator `d` using a closure that takes a parameter `b`.\n2. Inside the generator, there are two yield expressions that wait for a value and then return it.\n3. In the main loop, a new empty string `e` is created in each iteration.\n4. The generator `d` is resumed with the value of `e` using the `resume` method.\n5. The result of the `resume` method is matched against `GeneratorState::Yielded(f)`.\n6. If the result matches `GeneratorState::Yielded(f)`, it means a value was yielded by the generator, but it is not used in the current implementation.\n7. If the result does not match `GeneratorState::Yielded(f)`, the loop is exited.\n8. Finally, an empty string is created but not used.\n\nTo optimize out the variable `c`, we can remove it completely from the program:\n\n```rust\n#![feature(generators, generator_trait)]\nuse std::ops::{Generator, GeneratorState};\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut d = Box::pin(|_b| {\n        yield \"What is your name?\";\n        yield \"How are you feeling?\";\n    });\n\n    loop {\n        let e = String::new();\n        match d.as_mut().resume(e) {\n            GeneratorState::Yielded(_f) => {}\n            _ => {\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n        String::new();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nHere, the parameter `b` of the closure is renamed to `_b` to indicate that it is not used.
