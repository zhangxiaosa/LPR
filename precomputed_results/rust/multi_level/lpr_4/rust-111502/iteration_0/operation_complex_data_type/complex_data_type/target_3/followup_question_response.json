The program defines a function `c` that returns a boolean value.\n2. In the function `c`, there are several variable declarations:\n   - Variable `a` is declared as a tuple `(f32, bool)` initialized with the values `(0., true)`.\n   - Variable `b` is declared as a tuple `(f32, bool)` initialized with the values `(1., false)`.\n   - Variable `d` is declared as a tuple `(*mut (f32, bool), (f64, bool))` initialized with the address of `a` and the value of `b`.\n   - Variable `e` is declared as a boolean value assigned the result of calling the unsafe function `f` with arguments `d.0`, `d`, `true`, and `true`.\n3. The function `f` is defined as an unsafe function that takes several parameters:\n   - Parameter `k` is a mutable pointer to a tuple `(f32, bool)`.\n   - Parameter `d` is a tuple `(*mut (f32, bool), (f64, bool))`.\n   - Parameters `g` and `h` are boolean values.\n4.

The `main` function calls the function `c` and prints the returned value.\n\nTo decompose the complex data type into variables with primary data types, we need to extract the individual components of the tuples.

The variable `b` is declared as another tuple with the same data types as `a`. It is assigned a new value, `(1., false)`.\n4. The variable `d` is declared as a tuple with two elements: a mutable pointer to `a` obtained using the `addr_of_mut!` macro from the `core::ptr` module, and the value of `b`.\n5. The function `f` is called with arguments `d.0` (the mutable pointer to `a`), `d` (the tuple `d`), `true`, and `true`.\n6.
