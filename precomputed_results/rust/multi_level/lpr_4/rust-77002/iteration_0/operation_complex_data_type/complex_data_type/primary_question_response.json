The program starts with the `fn main()` function.\n2. Inside the `main` function, a constant `d` is declared and initialized with the value 4.\n3. The program defines another function `f` that takes various parameters, including two references to arrays with complex data types.\n4. The function `f` declares a mutable variable `l` and initializes it as a 2-dimensional array with complex data type `[[0; d]; d]`.\n5. A `for` loop iterates over the range `0..h` and assigns values to elements of the `l` array.\n6. The function `f` returns the `l` array.\n7. The program defines another constant `p`, which is a 2-dimensional array with complex data type `[[i64; d]; d]`.\n8. The program declares a mutable variable `l` and initializes it as a 2-dimensional array with complex data type `[[1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1]]`.\n9. The program calls the function `f` with specific arguments, including references to `p` and `l`, and assigns the returned value to `l`.\n10.
