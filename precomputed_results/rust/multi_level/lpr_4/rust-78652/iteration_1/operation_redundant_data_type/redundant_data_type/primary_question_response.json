The program has two attributes defined (`#![unstable(feature = \"humans\", issue = \"none\")]` and `#![feature(staged_api)]`), but these are not data types, so they are not considered redundant.\n\n2. The program defines a struct named `a`. This struct is not redundant since it is referenced in the implementation block.\n\n3. Inside the implementation block of struct `a`, there is a constant function named `b()`, which returns a primitive data type `u32`.
