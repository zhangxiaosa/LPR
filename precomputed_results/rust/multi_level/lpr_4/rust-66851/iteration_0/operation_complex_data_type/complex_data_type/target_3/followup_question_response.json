Here is a step-by-step analysis of the program:\n\n1. The program defines a function `d` that returns a value of type `u64`.\n2. Within the function `d`, there are several `const` declarations:\n   - `e` is of type `i32` and has a value of `7`.\n   - `f` is of type `i32` and its value is `1` left-shifted by `12`, which equals `4096`.\n   - `w` is of type `usize` and is assigned the value of `f` casted to `usize`.\n3. The program defines an enumeration `j` with three variants:\n   - `k(u64)` takes a `u64` value.\n   - `l(i32)` takes an `i32` value.\n   - `m` is a variant with no associated value.\n4. The program defines a function `n` that takes the following parameters:\n   - `aa` of type `i32`.\n   - `o` as a mutable reference to an array of arrays of `i32` with size `[16][2]`.\n   - `p` of type `i32`.\n   - `q` of type `i32`.\n   - `ab` of type `i32`.\n   - `ac` as a mutable reference to an array of `bool` with size `w`.\n   - `ad` as a mutable reference to an array of `i32`.\n   The function returns a value of type `j`.\n5. Inside the function `n`, there is an `if` statement that checks if `ab` is equal to `aa`. If true, the following steps are executed:\n   - A mutable variable `ae` of type `String` is created.\n   - A loop is executed from `0` to `ab - 1` (both inclusive) in reverse order.\n   - In each iteration, the value at index `1 << i` in the array `ad` is appended to `ae` as a string.\n   - The `ae` string is parsed to a `u64` value. If successful, `j::k(r)` is returned, where `r` is the parsed value. Otherwise, `j::m` is returned.\n6. If the `if` condition in step 5 is false, the following steps are executed:\n   - A mutable variable `t` of type `i32` is assigned `0`.\n   - A variable `y` of type `i32` is assigned the value of `q`.\n   - A loop is executed from `0` to `ab - 1` (exclusive).\n   - In each iteration, the maximum value between `o[index + 1][1] - o[index + 1][0]` and `t` is assigned to `t`.\n   - A mutable variable `u` of type `i32` is assigned the value of `t`.\n   - A while loop is executed as long as `u` is less than `y`.\n   - Inside the while loop, the following steps are executed:\n     - A mutable variable `af` of type `bool` is assigned `true`.\n     - A variable `ag` of type `i32` is assigned the value of `1 << ab`.\n     - A mutable variable `ah` of type `i32` is assigned `0`.\n     - A loop is executed from `0` to `ag` (exclusive).\n     - In each iteration, the value `ad[i] + u` is assigned to a variable `s`.\n     - If the value at index `s` in the array `ac` is `true`, `af` is assigned `false`, and the loop is broken.\n     - The value `s` is assigned to `ad[ag + i]`.\n     - The value `true` is assigned to `ac[s as usize]`.\n     - `ah` is incremented by `1`.\n   - If `af` is still `true` after the loop, the following steps are executed:\n     - A mutable variable `z` of type `[[i32; 2]; 16]` is created and initialized with default values.\n     - A loop is executed from `1` to `ab + 2` (inclusive).\n     - In each iteration, the minimum value between `o[i as usize][0].min(u + o[(i - 1) as usize][0])` and the maximum value between `o[i as usize][1].max(u + o[(i - 1) as usize][1])` is assigned to `z[i as usize][0]` and `z[i as usize][1]` respectively.\n     - A recursive call to the function `n` is made with the same arguments except for `ab` which is incremented by `1`.\n     - The result of the recursive call is assigned to a mutable variable `af`.\n     - A `match` statement is used to handle the result of the recursive call.\n       - If the result is `j::k(_)` or `j::m`, return the result.\n       - If the result is `j::l(v)`, continue to the next iteration of the loop.\n   - After the loop, another loop is executed `0` to `ah - 1` (inclusive).\n   - In each iteration, the value at index `ad[ag + i]` in the array `ac` is set to `false`.\n   - `u` is incremented by `1`.\n7. Finally, a `match` statement is used to handle the result of the function `n`. If the result is `j::k(s)`, return `s`. Otherwise, return `0`.\n8. The `main` function is defined.\n9. Inside the `main` function, an `assert_eq!` statement is used to compare the result of calling the `d` function with `20_313_839_404_245`.\n\nTo decompose the program into variables with primary data types, we need to identify which variables need to be decomposed and convert them to primary data types such as `i32`, `u64`, `usize`, and `bool`.

Based on the analysis, we can decompose them into variables with primary data types.\n\nHere is the step-by-step analysis and decomposition of the program:\n\n1. Complex Data Type: enum `j`\n   - Decomposition:\n     - Enum `j` has three variants: `k(u64)`, `l(i32)`, and `m`.\n     - We can decompose `j` into three separate variables:\n       - `j_k` of type `u64`\n       - `j_l` of type `i32`\n       - `j_m` of type `()`\n\n2. Complex Data Type: `&[[i32; 2]; 16]` (reference to a fixed-size array of size 16 containing arrays of size 2 with elements of type `i32`)\n   - Decomposition:\n     - Create a new type `Array2` that represents an array of size 2 with elements of type `i32`.\n     - Replace `&[[i32; 2]; 16]` with `&[Array2; 16]` to represent the same concept.\n\n3. Complex Data Type: `&mut [bool; w]` (mutable reference to a fixed-size array of size `w` containing elements of type `bool`)\n   - Decomposition:\n     - Replace `&mut [bool; w]` with `&mut [bool]` to represent a dynamically sized mutable slice containing elements of type `bool`.\n\n4. Complex Data Type: `[i32]` (array of elements of type `i32`)\n   - Decomposition:\n     - Replace `[i32]` with `Vec<i32>` to represent a dynamically sized vector containing elements of type `i32`.\n\n5. Complex Data Type: `[[i32; 2]; 16]` (fixed-size array of size 16 containing arrays of size 2 with elements of type `i32`)\n   - Decomposition:\n     - Create a new type `Array2` that represents an array of size 2 with elements of type `i32`.\n     - Replace `[[i32; 2]; 16]` with `[Array2; 16]` to represent the same concept.\n\n6. Complex Data Type: `[false; f as usize]` (fixed-size array of size `f` converted to `usize` containing elements initialized to `false`)\n   - Decomposition:\n     - Replace `[false; f as usize]` with `Vec<bool>::from(vec![false; f as usize])` to represent a dynamically sized vector containing `f` elements initialized to `false`.\n\n7. Complex Data Type: `[0i32; 1 << e]` (fixed-size array of size `1 << e` containing elements initialized to `0`)\n   - Decomposition:\n     - Replace `[0i32; 1 << e]` with `Vec<i32>::from(vec![0; 1 << e])` to represent a dynamically sized vector containing `1 << e` elements initialized to `0`.\n\nAfter decomposing the complex data types, we can replace them in the program with the corresponding variables of primary data types.
