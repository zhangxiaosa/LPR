Since `h` is a constant with the value of `5`, we can replace its uses with `5`. Starting with the line `arg % h`, we can replace `h` with `5`:\n```\narg % 5;\n```\n\n3. Continuing with the program, the next occurrence of `h` is in the calculation of `k1`. We can replace `h` with `5`:\n```\nlet k1 = (arg * m1) % 5;\n```\n\n4.

Since `h` is not modified after this assignment, we can propagate its value to any usage of `h`.\n\n3. In the expression `arg % h`, the value of `h` is `5`, and since the result of this expression is not used, we can remove this expression.\n\n4. Variable `m1` is declared and assigned the value `0`. This assignment is not affected by the value of `h`, so no changes are needed here.\n\n5. Variable `m1` is then assigned the value of `i` multiplied by `1`. This assignment is also not affected by the value of `h`, so no changes are needed here.\n\n6. Variable `k1` is assigned the result of `(arg * m1) % h`. Since we know that `h` is `5`, we can evaluate this expression to `(arg * m1) % 5`.\n\n7. The expression `(arg * m1) % 5` is equivalent to `(arg * (i * 1)) % 5`. We can simplify this expression further to `(arg * i) % 5`.\n\n8. The expected value of `k1` is `3`. We can assert this condition at the end of the program using `assert_eq!(k1, 3);`.\n\n9.
