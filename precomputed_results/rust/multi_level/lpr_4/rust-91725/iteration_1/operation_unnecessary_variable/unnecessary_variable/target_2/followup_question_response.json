The expression `arg % 5` computes the remainder of `arg` divided by 5 but doesn't store the result. This expression does not affect the optimization.\n4. The variable `m1` is declared as mutable.\n5.

Since the values of `arg`, `i`, and `m1` are known at compile time, we can evaluate `(arg * m1) % 5` during compile time.\n   - `arg` is known to be 4.\n   - `i` is known to be 2.\n   - `m1` is known to be 2 (since `m1` was assigned `i * 1` and `i` is 2).\n   - Thus, `(arg * m1) % 5` simplifies to `(4 * 2) % 5`, which is equal to 3.\n2. Since the result of `(arg * m1) % 5` is a known constant (3), we can replace the declaration of `k1` with the constant value 3.\n3.
