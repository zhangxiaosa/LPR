Enter a while loop that checks if 2 is equal to 0. This loop is an infinite loop and does not affect the optimization of `k`.\n\n3. Initialize `k` and assign it the value of `arg`. Since `arg` is a constant value of 4, we can propagate this constant into `k`.\n\n4. Initialize `l` and assign it the value of 0.\n\n5. Update `l` by multiplying it with a constant value of 1. This operation does not affect the optimization of `k`.\n\n6. Update `k` by multiplying it with `l` and then taking the modulus with `h`. Since the values of `l`, `h`, and the multiplication operation are all constants, we can perform constant propagation and compute the result, which is 3. We can replace the assignment of `k` with the constant value of 3.\n\n7. Perform the assertion using `assert_eq!()`, which checks if `k` is equal to 3.

This condition is always false, so the loop will never run. However, this loop has no effect on the value of `k`.\n\n3. The program assigns the value of `arg` to `k`: `k = arg;`. At this point, `k` has the value of 4.\n\n4. The program assigns the value of 0 to `l`: `l = 0;`.\n\n5. The program updates the value of `l` by multiplying `i` by 1: `l = i * 1;`.
