Start by declaring the complex data type `p` and initializing it with values:\n   ```rust\n   const p: [[i64; 4]; 4] = [[0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1], [1, 2, 2, 2]];\n   ```\n   In this step, `p` is declared as a constant 2D array of 64-bit signed integers with dimensions 4x4 and initialized with the provided values.\n\n2.
