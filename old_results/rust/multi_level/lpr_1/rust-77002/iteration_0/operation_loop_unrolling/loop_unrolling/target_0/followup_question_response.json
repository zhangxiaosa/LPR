Identify loop dependencies: Analyze the loop body to identify any dependencies between loop iterations. In this case, there are no explicit dependencies.\n\n2. Determine the loop trip count: The loop trip count is the number of iterations the loop will execute. In this case, the trip count is `n`.\n\n3. Unroll the loop: Replace the loop with multiple copies of the loop body, each covering a subset of the original iterations.\n\n```rust\n// Original loop:\nfor i in 0..n {\n    // Loop body\n}\n\n// Unrolled loop with factor 4:\n// Iteration 1\n// Loop body\n\n// Iteration 2\n// Loop body\n\n// Iteration 3\n// Loop body\n\n// Iteration 4\n// Loop body\n```\n\n4. Update loop variables: In each unrolled iteration, update the loop variables to correspond to the original iteration they represent.\n\n```rust\n// Unrolled loop with factor 4:\n// Iteration 1: i = 0\n// Loop body\n\n// Iteration 2: i = 1\n// Loop body\n\n// Iteration 3: i = 2\n// Loop body\n\n// Iteration 4: i = 3\n// Loop body\n```\n\n5. Adjust loop termination condition: Modify the loop termination condition to match the number of unrolled iterations. In this case, the loop termination condition becomes `i < n / 4`.\n\n6. Combine the unrolled loop code: After unrolling the loop, combine the unrolled iterations into a single sequence of statements.\n\n```rust\n// Unrolled loop with factor 4:\n// Iteration 1: i = 0\n// Loop body\n\n// Iteration 2: i = 1\n// Loop body\n\n// Iteration 3: i = 2\n// Loop body\n\n// Iteration 4: i = 3\n// Loop body\n\n// Combined unrolled loop:\n// Loop body\n// Loop body\n// Loop body\n// Loop body\n```\n\nAfter applying loop unrolling, the modified program will have the optimized loop.

The innermost statement within the loop is `l[i][j] = b[k][j];`.\n3. The loop updates the value at index `[i][j]` of the array `l` with the value at index `[k][j]` of the array `b`. The value of `k` does not depend on the loop index `i`.\n\nBased on the analysis, we can optimize the loop by unrolling it.
