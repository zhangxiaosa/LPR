The program has a function `main()` which is the entry point of the program.\n2. There is a constant variable `d` of type `usize` assigned a value of 4.\n3. The function `f` is defined with the following parameters:\n   - `a` of type `&[[i64; 4]]`\n   - `b` of type `&[[i64; 4]]`\n   - `n` of type `usize`\n   - `g` of type `usize`\n   - `h` of type `usize`\n4. Within the `f` function, a mutable variable `l` is declared as `[[0; 4]; 4]`, representing a 4x4 array initialized with zeros.\n5. The function contains nested for loops to iterate over `i`, `j`, and `k`.\n6. The innermost loop sets the value of `l[i][j]` to `b[k][j + 1]`.\n7. The function returns the array `l` as the result.\n8. Outside the function, there is another constant variable `p` of type `[[i64; 4]; 4]` initialized with specific values.\n9. A mutable variable `l` is declared and assigned a 4x4 array with specific initial values.\n10.
