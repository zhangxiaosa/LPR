The program declares a constant variable named `a` as a raw pointer to an unsigned 32-bit integer (`*const u32`).\n2. Inside a block, a variable named `b` is declared.\n3. The value of `b` is assigned the reference to `b` itself (`&b`).\n4. There is a function named `c` defined.\n5. Inside the function `c`, a variable named `a` is declared and assigned the value of `a`. However, since `a` is already referring to the constant `a`, this assignment has no effect.\n\nTo optimize the program and eliminate the constant `a`, we can modify the program as follows:\n\n```rust\nfn c() {\n    let a: u32;\n    let b = &a;\n}\n```\n\nThe optimized program declares `a` as a mutable unsigned 32-bit integer (`u32`) inside the function `c`.

The address of `b` is then assigned to `a`.\n4. There is a function `c` defined, which appears to have a shadowing variable `a`.\n5. However, the shadowed variable `a` is assigned to itself, which does nothing.\n\nTo optimize the program and decompose the complex data type into variables with primary data types, we can do the following modifications:\n\n1. Remove the constant definition and the complex data type (`*const u32`).\n2. Remove the unnecessary shadowing variable assignment inside the function `c`.\n3.
