The program starts with the declaration of a constant `a` of type `*const u32`. This is a global variable.\n\n2. Inside the program, there is a block of code where a local variable `b` is declared. However, `b` is not used anywhere, so it can be considered an unused variable within the block.\n\n3. Inside the block, there is a reference to `b` (`&b`). Since `b` is declared and used within the same block, it can be considered an intermediate variable.\n\n4. After the block, there is a function definition for `c()`. Inside the function, a local variable `a` is declared and assigned the value of `a`.
