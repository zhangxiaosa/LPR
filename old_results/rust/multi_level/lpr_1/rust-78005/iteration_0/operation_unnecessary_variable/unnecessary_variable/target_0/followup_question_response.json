The variable `x` is declared with different types multiple times. Since we're optimizing it out, we don't need to consider the types. We can remove all the lines declaring `x` with different types.\n\n2. After removing the lines declaring `x` with different types, we're left with the following program:\n\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    let x;\n    let x;\n    let x;\n    let x;\n    let x;\n    let x;\n    let x;\n    let x;\n    let x;\n    let x;\n    let x;\n    let x;\n    let x;\n    let x;\n    let x;\n    let x;\n    let x;\n}\n```\n\n3.
