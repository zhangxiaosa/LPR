The program initially declares `x` as `isize < isize >`.\n2. It then redeclares `x` with a different type `i8 < isize >`. This redeclaration masks the previous declaration of `x`.\n3. The process continues with subsequent redeclarations of `x` with different types, namely `i16 < isize >`, `i32 < isize >`, and `i64 < isize >`. These redeclarations also mask the previous declarations of `x`.\n4. The next declaration of `x` is `usize < main >`. This redeclaration again masks the previous declarations of `x`.\n5. Following this, there are multiple redeclarations of `x` without specifying any type. These redundant redeclarations serve no purpose and can be removed.\n6. Finally, the program ends with an empty block containing multiple redeclarations of `x`. These redeclarations are also redundant and can be eliminated.\n\nBased on the given target to optimize `x: i16 < isize >`, we can simplify the program by removing unnecessary redeclarations of `x` and only keeping the optimized version.
