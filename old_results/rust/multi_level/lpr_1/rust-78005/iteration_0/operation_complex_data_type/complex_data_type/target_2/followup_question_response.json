The target to be optimized is `i64<isize>`. We need to decompose this complex data type as well.\n\n3. To decompose the complex data types, we first need to understand what the complex data types `isize<T>` and `i64<T>` mean. These complex data types are parameterized types, where `T` represents the underlying data type.\n\n4. The `isize<T>` data type is a signed integer type that is the same size as a pointer. The underlying data type `T` can be different integer sizes like `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, or `i64`.\n\n5. The `i64<T>` data type is a signed 64-bit integer type. The underlying data type `T` can also be any integer size.\n\n6. To decompose these complex data types, we need to replace the occurrences of `isize<T>` and `i64<T>` with their corresponding primary data types.\n\n7.
