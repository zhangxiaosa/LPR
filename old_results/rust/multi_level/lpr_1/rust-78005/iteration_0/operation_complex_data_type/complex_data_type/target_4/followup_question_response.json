The program starts with the function declaration `fn main() { }`, which is the entry point of the program.\n2. Following the function declaration, there are multiple variable declarations using the `let` keyword.\n3. Each variable declaration starts with `let x`, followed by a colon (`:`) and a data type.\n4.

The target to be optimized is `isize < isize >`.\n6. To decompose the variables into primary data types, we can analyze the given data types and determine their primary type counterparts:\n   - `isize < isize >` can be decomposed to `isize`\n   - `i8 < isize >` can be decomposed to `i8`\n   - `i16 < isize >` can be decomposed to `i16`\n   - `i32 < isize >` can be decomposed to `i32`\n   - `i64 < isize >` can be decomposed to `i64`\n   - `usize < main >` can be decomposed to `usize`\n   \n7. Based on the analysis, we can rewrite the variable declarations using primary data types:\n   ```rust\n   let x1: isize;\n   let x2: i8;\n   let x3: i16;\n   let x4: i32;\n   let x5: i64;\n   let x6: usize;\n   let x7: <data_type>;\n   let x8: <data_type>;\n   let x9: <data_type>;\n   let x10: <data_type>;\n   let x11: <data_type>;\n   let x12: <data_type>;\n   let x13: <data_type>;\n   let x14: <data_type>;\n   let x15: <data_type>;\n   let x16: <data_type>;\n   let x17: <data_type>;\n   let x18: <data_type>;\n   let x19: <data_type>;\n   let x20: <data_type>;\n   let x21: <data_type>;\n   ```\n   \n   Note: Replace `<data_type>` with the appropriate primary data types based on the program context.\n\n8.
