In the function `a`, the parameter `b` has the complex data type `&i32`, which is a pointer to an `i32` integer.\n2. Inside the function `a`, the variable `c` is declared without a specified data type. However, since it is not assigned any value, its data type cannot be determined.\n3. In the function `d`, the variable `e` is declared without a specified data type. Similar to `c`, its data type cannot be determined.\n4.
