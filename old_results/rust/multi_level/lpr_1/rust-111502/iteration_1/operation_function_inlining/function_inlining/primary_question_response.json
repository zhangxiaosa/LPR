Function `c() -> bool`: This function takes no arguments and returns a boolean value. It declares a mutable variable `a` of type `(f32, bool)` and initializes it with the tuple `(0., true)`. It then calls the unsafe function `f()` with various arguments and assigns the result to variable `e`. Finally, it returns the value of `e`.\n\n2. Unsafe function `f(_: *mut (f32, bool), d: (*mut (f32, bool), (f64, bool)), g: bool, _: bool) -> bool`: This function takes multiple arguments, including a mutable pointer to `(f32, bool)`, a tuple, and booleans. It initializes variable `i` with the address of `d.1` as a mutable pointer to a boolean. It then assigns the value of `g` to the memory location pointed by `i` and performs an unused statement on `d`.
