Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. The program defines a function `d` that returns an `Option<u64>`.\n2. Inside the function `d`, two constants `e` and `f` are declared as `i32` with values 7 and 12, respectively.\n3. Next, an enum `Option<u64>` is defined, which has two variants - `Some(u64)` and `None`.\n4. Within the `d` function, there is another function `n` defined. It takes several arguments, including `aa`, `o`, `p`, `q`, `ab`, `ac_decomposed`, and `ad`, and returns an `Option<u64>`.\n5. Inside the `n` function, a mutable string `ae` is declared.\n6. There is a `for` loop iterating over the range 0 to 2.\n7. In each iteration of the loop, the value of `ad[i]` is converted to a string and appended to `ae`.\n8. After the loop, the `ae` string is parsed into a `u64` value and returned as `Option::Some(r)`, if the parsing is successful. Otherwise, `Option::None` is returned.\n9. Back in the `d` function, two empty arrays `ac_decomposed` and `ad` are declared.\n10. An array `o` with the type `[[i32; 2]; 16]` is declared and initialized with default values using `Default::default()`.\n11. The `n` function is called with arguments `e`, `&o`, `f`, `f`, 0, `&ac_decomposed`, and `&ad`. The return value is matched against the enum variants.\n12. If the return value is `Option::Some(_)`, i.e., not `Option::None`, `Some(203_138_394_042_45)` is returned.\n13. Otherwise, `None` is returned.\n14. Outside the `d` function, the `main` function is defined.\n15. Inside the `main` function, an assertion is made that `d()` should return `Some(203_138_394_042_45)`.\n\nNow, let's decompose the complex data type `ac_decomposed` into variables with primary data types as requested. Since the initial declaration `let ac_decomposed = [];` does not provide any information about the intended type or content, we'll assume it's an array of booleans. \n\nHere's the modified program with the decomposed variables:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"program\": \"fn d() -> Option<u64> {\\n    const e: i32 = 7;\\n    const f: i32 = 12;\\n    enum Option<u64> {\\n        Some(u64),\\n        None,\\n    }\\n    fn n(\\n        aa: i32,\\n        o: &[[i32; 2]],\\n        p: i32,\\n        q: i32,\\n        ab: i32,\\n        ac_decomposed: &[bool],\\n        ad: &[i32],\\n    ) -> Option<u64> {\\n        let mut ae = String::new();\\n        for i in 0..2 {\\n            ae += &ad[i].to_string();\\n        }\\n        if let Ok(r) = ae.parse() {\\n            Option::Some(r)\\n        } else {\\n            Option::None\\n        }\\n    }\\n    let ac_decomposed: [bool; 0] = [];\\n    let ad = [0i32; 1 << e];\\n    let o: [[i32; 2]; 16] = Default::default();\\n    match n(e, &o, f, f, 0, &ac_decomposed, &ad) {\\n        Option::Some(_) => Some(203_138_394_042_45),\\n        _ => None,\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nfn main() {\\n    assert_eq!(d(), Some(203_138_394_042_45));\\n}\"\n}\n```\n\nIn the modified version, `ac_decomposed` is decomposed into a variable with a primary data type of `[bool; 0]` with an empty array `[]`.

Two constants `e` (with the value 7) and `f` (with the value 12) are declared as `i32`.\n3.

Inside the function `n`, a mutable local variable `ae` of type `String` is declared.\n5.
