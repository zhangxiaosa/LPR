Function `c`:\n   - Returns a boolean value.\n   - Initializes a mutable variable `a` as a floating-point number `0.0`.\n   - Defines a mutable reference `d_0` to `a`.\n   - Defines a boolean variable `d_3` as `false`.\n   - Calls the function `f` with arguments: `d_0`, `(d_0, true, 0.0, d_3)`, `true`, and `true`.\n   - Returns the value returned by the function `f`.\n\n2. Unsafe function `f`:\n   - Takes the following arguments:\n     - A mutable pointer `k` to a 32-bit floating-point number.\n     - A tuple `d` containing:\n       - A mutable pointer `*mut f32`.\n       - A boolean value `bool`.\n       - A 64-bit floating-point number `f64`.\n       - A boolean value `bool`.\n     - A boolean argument `g`.\n     - An unused boolean argument `_`.\n   - Calculates a mutable pointer `i` to `d.3` (the fourth element of the tuple `d`).\n   - Assigns the value of `g` to the memory location pointed by `i`.\n   - Ignores the tuple `d`.\n   - Returns the boolean value `d.3`.\n\n3.
