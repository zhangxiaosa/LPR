The program defines a function named `c()` that returns a boolean value.\n2. Inside the `c()` function, there is a variable `a_3` of type bool with the initial value `false`.\n3.

It is assigned the address of the third element in the tuple `a` using the `core::ptr::addr_of!()` function.\n6. The value pointed to by `i` is updated with the value of `b`.\n7.
