The program contains a main function called `main()`.\n2. Inside the `main()` function, there is another function called `f()` defined. It takes two slices of `i64` type (`a` and `b`), and two `usize` type variables (`g` and `h`). It returns an array of `i64` type with a fixed size of 4 (`[i64; 4]`).\n3. Inside the `f()` function, there is a mutable array `l` of `i64` type with a fixed size of 4 (`[0i64; 4]`). It is initialized with all elements set to 0.\n4. There's a for loop that iterates from 0 to `h-1`. On each iteration, the value of the `j` index in array `l` is assigned with the value at index `j` of array `b`.\n5. After the for loop, the `l` array is returned.\n6. The program defines a constant array `p` of `i64` type with a fixed size of 16 and initializes it with the given values.\n7. There's a mutable array `l` of `i64` type with a fixed size of 4 (`[1, 0, 0, 0]`).\n8. There's a 2D array `b` of `i64` type with a single row (`[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]`).\n9. The `f()` function is called with arguments `&b[0]` (the first row of `b`), `&l` (a reference to `l`), 4, and 4. The returned array is assigned to `l`.\n10. The value of `l` is printed using `println!(\"{:?}\", l)`.\n\nNow, let's decompose the complex data types into variables with primary data types:\n\n1. Slice `a` (inside `f()` function parameter) and `b` (inside `f()` function parameter) are both of `&[i64]` type, which represents a reference to an array of `i64` type. We can decompose them as separate arrays. Let's call them `a_decomposed` and `b_decomposed` respectively.\n\n2. The returned array from the `f()` function can be decomposed as individual `i64` variables. We can name them as `l_0`, `l_1`, `l_2`, and `l_3` respectively.\n\n3. The constant array `p` can be decomposed as individual `i64` variables. We can name them as `p_0` to `p_15` respectively.\n\n4. The mutable array `l` can be decomposed as individual `i64` variables. We can name them as `l_0`, `l_1`, `l_2`, and `l_3` respectively.\n\n5. The 2D array `b` can be decomposed as a nested array of `i64` type. We can name it `b_decomposed`.\n\nWith these decompositions, we have the following variables:\n\n1. `a_decomposed`: [i64]\n2. `b_decomposed`: [i64]\n3. `l_0`, `l_1`, `l_2`, `l_3`: i64\n4. `p_0` to `p_15`: i64\n5. `l_0`, `l_1`, `l_2`, `l_3`: i64\n6. `b_decomposed`: [[i64; 16]]\n\nHere's the final program with the decomposed variables in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"program\": \"fn main() {\\n    fn f(a: &[i64], b: &[i64], g: usize, h: usize) -> [i64; 4] {\\n        let mut l = [0i64; 4];\\n        for j in 0..h {\\n            l[j] = b[j];\\n        }\\n        l\\n    }\\n    const p_0: i64 = 0;\\n    const p_1: i64 = 1;\\n    // truncated for brevity\\n    const p_15: i64 = 2;\\n    let mut l_0 = 1;\\n    let mut l_1 = 0;\\n    let mut l_2 = 0;\\n    let mut l_3 = 0;\\n    let b_decomposed = [\\n        [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2],\\n    ];\\n    let a_decomposed = b_decomposed[0];\\n    l_0, l_1, l_2, l_3 = f(&a_decomposed, &[l_0, l_1, l_2, l_3], 4, 4);\\n    println!(\\\"{:?}\\\", [l_0, l_1, l_2, l_3]);\\n}\\n\"\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that the variable names might differ from the ones suggested here.
