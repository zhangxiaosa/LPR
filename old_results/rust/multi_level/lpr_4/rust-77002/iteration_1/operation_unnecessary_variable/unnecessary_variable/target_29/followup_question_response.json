Since the assignment statement `result[0] = b[0]` copies the complete first row of `b` to the first row of `result`, the value at `result_3_1` remains unchanged.\n\nTherefore, the optimized version of the program would look like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"program\": \"fn main() {\\n    let mut l = [\\n        [1i64, 0i64, 0i64, 0i64],\\n        [0i64, 0i64, 0i64, 0i64],\\n        [0i64, 0i64, 1i64, 0i64],\\n        [0i64, 0i64, 0i64, 1i64],\\n    ];\\n    l = f(&l);\\n    println!(\\\"{:?}\\\", l);\\n}\\n\\nfn f(b: &[[i64; 4]]) -> [[i64; 4]; 4] {\\n    let mut result = [\\n        [0i64, 0i64, 0i64, 0i64],\\n        [0i64, 0i64, 0i64, 0i64],\\n        [0i64, 0i64, 1i64, 0i64],\\n        [0i64, 0i64, 0i64, 0i64],\\n    ];\\n    result[0] = b[0];\\n    let result_3_1 = result[2][0];\\n    result\\n}\"\n}\n```"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 400, "completion_tokens": 3120, "total_tokens": 3520}, "system_fingerprint": null}
