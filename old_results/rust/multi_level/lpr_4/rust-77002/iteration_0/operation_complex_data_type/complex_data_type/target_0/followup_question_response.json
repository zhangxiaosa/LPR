The program starts with the main function `fn main()`.\n2. Inside the main function, a constant `d` is defined with the value 4. It has the data type `usize`.\n3. Another function `f` is defined with the following parameters:\n   - `a`: a reference to a 2D array of `i64` with size `[d][d]`\n   - `b`: a reference to a 2D array of `i64` with size `[d][d]`\n   - `n`: an integer with the value of `usize`\n   - `g`: an integer with the value of `usize`\n   - `h`: an integer with the value of `usize`\n4. The return type of the `f` function is a 2D array of `i64` with size `[d][d]`.\n5. Inside the `f` function, a mutable variable `l` is defined as a 2D array of `i64` with size `[d][d]` and initialized with all zeros.\n6. A loop iterates from 0 to `h-1`, and in each iteration, the value of `b[0][j]` is assigned to `l[0][j]`.\n7. Finally, the `l` variable is returned from the `f` function.\n8. A constant `p` is defined as a 2D array of `i64` initialized with the given values.\n9. A mutable variable `l` is defined as a 2D array of `i64` and initialized with the given values.\n10. The `f` function is called with the references to `p`, `l`, and the values of `d`, `d`, and `d`.\n11. The resulting value returned from the `f` function is assigned back to `l`.\n12. The value of `l` is printed using `println!` macro with the `{:?}` format specifier.\n13.
