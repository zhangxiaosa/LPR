The variable `a` is declared as a constant with the value 10.\n2. The variable `b` is declared as a constant and assigned the value of `a` with a type cast using `std::mem::transmute`. This line is potentially unsafe because it is performing a type cast between unrelated types, which can lead to undefined behavior.\n3. The `main` function is declared.\n4. The variable `c` is declared but not initialized.\n5. A `match` expression is used to match the value of `c` against the pattern `_b`.\n6. Inside the match arm, a new variable `b` is declared and assigned the value of `_b`. This is a shadowing declaration, creating a new variable `b` that shadows the outer `b`.\n\nTo optimize out the variable `c`, we can replace its usage with the constant value it would have had if it was initialized.
