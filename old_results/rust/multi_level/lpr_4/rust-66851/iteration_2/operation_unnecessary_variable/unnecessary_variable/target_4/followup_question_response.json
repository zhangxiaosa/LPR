The returned value from the function n is matched against j::k(ad_i_u).\n   - If it matches, the value ad_i_u is returned.\n   - Otherwise, 0 is returned.\n7. The main function asserts that the value returned by d() is equal to 20_313_839_404_245.\n\nConstant propagation and copy propagation can be applied to optimize the program by eliminating unused or redundant assignments. In this case, the target variable to be optimized is ad.\n\nHere's the final optimized program:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"program\": \"fn d() -> u64 {\\n    enum j {\\n        k(u64),\\n        l(i32),\\n        m,\\n    }\\n    fn n(o: &[[i32; 2]; 16], p: i32, q: i32, ab: i32, ac: &mut [bool], ad: &mut [i32]) -> j {\\n        if ab == 7 {\\n            let mut ae = String::new();\\n            for i in (0..ab).rev() {\\n                ae += &ad[1 << i].to_string();\\n            }\\n            return if let Ok(r) = ae.parse() {\\n                j::k(r)\\n            } else {\\n                j::m\\n            };\\n        }\\n        let mut u = o[3][1] - o[3][0];\\n        while u < q {\\n            let mut af = true;\\n            let mut t = 0;\\n            let ab_unrolled = 1 << ab;\\n            for i in 0..ab_unrolled {\\n                let ad_i_u = ad[i] + u;\\n                if ac[ad_i_u as usize] {\\n                    af = false;\\n                    break;\\n                }\\n                ad[ab_unrolled + i] = ad_i_u;\\n                ac[ad_i_u as usize] = true;\\n                t += ab_unrolled;\\n            }\\n            if af {\\n                let mut z: [[i32; 2]; 16] = Default::default();\\n                for i in 1..ab + 2 {\\n                    z[i as usize][0] = 2147483647.min(u + o[(i - 1) as usize][0]);\\n                    z[i as usize][1] = o[i as usize][1].max(u + o[(i - 1) as usize][1]);\\n                }\\n                let af = n(&z, p, u, ab + 1, ac, ad);\\n                match af {\\n                    j::k(_) | j::m => return af,\\n                    j::l(_) => {}\\n                }\\n            }\\n            for i in 0..(t / ab_unrolled) {\\n                ac[ad[ab_unrolled + i] as usize] = false;\\n            }\\n            u += 1;\\n        }\\n        j::l(p)\\n    }\\n    let mut ac = [false; 8192];\\n    let o = Default::default();\\n    match n(&o, 4096, 4096, 0, &mut ac, &mut []) {\\n        j::k(ad_i_u) => ad_i_u as u64,\\n        _ => 0,\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nfn main() {\\n    assert_eq!(d(), 20_313_839_404_245);\\n}\"\n}\n```"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 733, "completion_tokens": 4739, "total_tokens": 5472}, "system_fingerprint": null}
