The target variable to be optimized is `af`, which is a boolean variable.\n\n2. The variable `af` is assigned the value `true` before its first usage.\n\n3. The variable `af` is initialized inside the `if af` block and is only modified inside that block.\n\n4. The `if af` block is executed only if the boolean condition `af` is `true`.\n\n5. If the `if af` block is executed, the value of `af` remains constant (`true`) until the end of the function.\n\n6. There are no other assignments or modifications of `af` beyond the `if af` block.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can perform constant propagation on the variable `af` and optimize it out. Since `af` is constant within the `if af` block and never modified outside of it, we can replace all the occurrences of `af` with the constant value `true`.
