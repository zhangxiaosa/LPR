The function `d` is defined in the `b` trait, so we'll look for the implementation of `d` within the `b` trait.\n\n3. Inside the `b` trait, we find the definition of the `d` function:\n   ```rust\n   fn d<e>(self, e) -> f<e> {}\n   ```\n\n4. The `d` function takes two generic parameters, `self` and `e`, and returns an instance of the `f` struct with the type parameter `e`.\n\n5.
