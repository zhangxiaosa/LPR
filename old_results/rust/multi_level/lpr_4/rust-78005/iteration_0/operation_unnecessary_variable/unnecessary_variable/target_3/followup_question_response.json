Next `x` declaration: `let x: i64 < isize >;`\n   - This declaration assigns a type `i64 < isize >` to `x` but does not initialize it.\n   - This is the target variable we want to optimize.\n   - Constant propagation is not possible as there is no constant assigned to `x`.\n   - Copy propagation is not possible.\n\n6. Next `x` declaration: `let x: usize < main >;`\n   - This declaration assigns a type `usize < main >` to `x` but does not initialize it.\n   - Constant propagation is not possible.\n   - Copy propagation is not possible.\n\n7.
