Start by analyzing the program code:\n   - The program consists of three functions: `c()`, `f()`, and `main()`.\n   - The `c()` function returns a boolean value.\n   - The `f()` function is marked as unsafe and returns a boolean value. It takes three parameters:\n     - `_k` of pointer type `*mut (f64, bool)`\n     - `d` of tuple type `(*mut (f64, bool), (f64, bool))`\n     - `g` of boolean type\n   - The `f()` function updates the boolean value pointed to by `i` with the value of `g` and returns the second element of the `d` tuple.\n   - The `main()` function calls `c()` and prints the returned value.\n3. Substitute every instance of the target data type `f64` with its associated original data type:\n   - Update the signature of the `f()` function to `unsafe fn f(_k: *mut (f64, bool), d: (*mut (f64, bool), (bool, bool)), g: bool) -> bool`.\n   - Update the assignment statement `let i = core::ptr::addr_of!(d.1 .1) as *mut bool;` to `let i = core::ptr::addr_of!(d.1 .1) as *mut f64;`.\n4.
