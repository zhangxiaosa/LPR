The program has a function `c()` that returns a Boolean value.\n2. Inside `c()`, there is a mutable variable `a` of complex data type `(f64, bool)`. We'll decompose it into two variables: `a_0` (f64) and `a_1` (bool).\n3. The function `f()` is called within `c()` using `unsafe` block. It takes three parameters: `_k`, `d`, and `g`.\n4. Parameter `_k` is a pointer to a tuple of `(f64, bool)`. We'll decompose it into `_k_0` (f64) and `_k_1` (bool).\n5. Parameter `d` is a tuple of a pointer to `(f64, bool)` and another tuple `(f64, bool)`. We'll decompose it into `d_0` (pointer to `(f64, bool)`) and `d_1` (tuple `(f64, bool)`).\n6. In `f()`, there is a pointer assignment where `i` is assigned the address of `d.1.1` as a pointer to `bool`.\n7. The value of `g` is assigned to the memory location pointed by `i`.\n8.
