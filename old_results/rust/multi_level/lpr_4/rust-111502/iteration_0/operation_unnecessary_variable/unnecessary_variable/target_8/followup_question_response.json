Let's analyze the program step by step:\n\n1. The `c` function initializes a mutable variable `a` as a tuple with values `(0.0, true)`.\n2. Inside the `c` function, there is a call to the unsafe function `f`. The call passes the mutable reference of `a`, a tuple `(core::ptr::addr_of_mut!(a), (1.0, false))`, and `true` as arguments. The return value of the `f` function is stored in the variable `e`.\n3. The `f` function is defined with unsafe keyword. It takes three arguments: a mutable pointer `_k`, a tuple `d`, and a boolean `g`.\n4. Inside the `f` function, there is a statement that assigns the address of `d.1 .1` (the second element of the inner tuple within `d`) to a mutable pointer `i`.\n5. The value of `g` is then stored in `*i`, updating the second element of the inner tuple within `d`.\n6. The `d` tuple is then discarded.\n7.
