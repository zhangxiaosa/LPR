The program defines a function `c()` that takes no arguments and returns a boolean value.\n2. Inside the function `c()`, a mutable variable `a` is declared and initialized with a tuple `(0., true)`.\n3. Another variable `e` is declared and assigned the result of a function call to `f()`.

The `f()` function is defined as `unsafe` since it uses raw pointers. It takes three parameters:\n   - `_k`: A mutable pointer to a tuple `(f32, bool)`.\n   - `d`: A tuple containing:\n     - A mutable pointer to a tuple `(f32, bool)`.\n     - Another tuple `(f64, bool)`.\n   - `g`: A boolean value.\n5.
