Target: The target data type to be optimized is `i32`.\n\n2. Program Analysis: The given program consists of two functions:\n   - Function `a`: It takes a reference to an `i32` as an argument (`b: &i32`) and returns a reference to an `i32`. The function body simply returns the reference `b`.\n   - Function `d`: It doesn't take any arguments. Within this function, there is a call to the `assert_eq!` macro, comparing two instances of `a`. However, there are no concrete values passed to the `a` function.\n\n3. Optimization: To eliminate the target data type (`&i32`) and substitute it with the original data type (`i32`), the following modifications need to be made:\n   - Function `a`: The argument type `&i32` should be changed to `i32`, and the return type `&i32` should be changed to `i32`.\n   - Function `d`: Since the call to `a` doesn't provide any concrete values, it can be removed as it doesn't affect the program's behavior.\n\n4.
