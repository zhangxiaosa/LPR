The program starts with defining a function `a` that takes a reference to an `i32` as an argument and returns a reference to an `i32`.\n2.

Inside the function `d`, a variable `e` of an unknown data type is declared, but it is not assigned any value.\n5. The program contains an assertion statement `assert_eq!(a, e)`, which compares the values of `a` and `e`.\n\nTo optimize the program, we need to decompose the complex data types into variables with primary data types, specifically for the variable `b`.\n\nHere is the modified program:\n\n```rust\nfn a(b: &i32) -> &i32 {\n    let b_primary_type = *b;\n    let c;\n    c\n}\nfn d() {\n    let e;\n    let e_primary_type;\n    assert_eq!(b_primary_type, e_primary_type);\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that in the original program, the variable `b` is not used inside the `fn a` function.

The parameter `b` is of type `&i32`, which is a reference to an `i32` value.

The return type is `&i32`, which is a reference to an `i32` value.

Since `e` is not used further in the code, we can simply remove it.
