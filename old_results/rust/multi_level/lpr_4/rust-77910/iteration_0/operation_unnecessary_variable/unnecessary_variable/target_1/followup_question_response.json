Let's analyze the program to determine if `e` can be optimized out through constant propagation or copy propagation.\n\nIn the given program, `e` is assigned a value from a function call `a`. The function `a` takes a reference to an `i32` as an argument and returns the same reference. In the function `d`, `e` is compared to a variable `a` using the `assert_eq!` macro.\n\nTo determine if `e` can be optimized out, we'll check if the value assigned to `e` is a constant or if it can be replaced with a copy of `a`.\n\nStep 2: Constant Propagation\nIn this case, the value assigned to `e` is not a constant, but a reference passed from the function `a`. Constant propagation is not possible in this scenario.\n\nStep 3: Copy Propagation\nTo apply copy propagation, we need to determine if the value assigned to `e` can be replaced with a copy of `a`.
