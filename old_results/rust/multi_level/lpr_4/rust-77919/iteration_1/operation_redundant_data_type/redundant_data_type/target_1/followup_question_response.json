We have a trait called `TypeVal` with a generic type parameter `d`.\n2. The trait has a associated constant `c` of type `d`.\n3. There are two structs defined: `Five` and `b`.\n4. There is an implementation of `TypeVal<usize>` for struct `b` with a where clause specifying that `Five` must implement `TypeVal<c>`.\n5. In the `main` function, there is an array creation expression `[1; b::c]`.\n\nBased on the given instructions, we need to eliminate the type `b` and substitute every instance of it with its associated original data type, which is `usize`.
