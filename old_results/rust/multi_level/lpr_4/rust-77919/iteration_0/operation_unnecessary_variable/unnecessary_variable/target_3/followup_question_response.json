The implementation associates the constant `c` of `TypeVal` with the constant `Five::c`.\n\nIn the `main` function, an array of size `b::c` filled with the value `1` is created.\n\nStep 2: Optimization - Constant Propagation\n\nIn this case, the constant propagation optimization can be applied to remove the variable `b::c` if it is unused or replace it with its constant value if it is used.\n\nSince the array creation `[1; b::c]` uses `b::c`, we cannot remove it completely.

The target variable to be optimized is `b::c`.\n\nStep 2: Analysis of `b::c`:\nThe `b::c` variable is defined in the `TypeVal` trait with the constant value `d`.

Since we couldn't determine the constant value of `b::c` in the previous step, we cannot perform copy propagation in this step.\n\nStep 3: Remove Unused Variable\n- Check if the variable `b` is used anywhere in the program.
