Replace the original `v20_decomposed` variable with the decomposed variables:\n   - Remove `let mut v20_decomposed = [197_u8; 8];`\n   - Add the decomposed variables:\n     ```\n     let v20_decomposed_0: u8 = 197;\n     let v20_decomposed_1: u8 = 197;\n     ...\n     let v20_decomposed_7: u8 = 197;\n     ```\n\n4. Replace the occurrences of `v20_decomposed` with the decomposed variables in the program.\n\n5. Optimize the target `v33_2_ptr` by replacing `v33_2_ptr = ptr::addr_of_mut!(f_0);` with `v33_2_ptr = &mut f_0;`.\n\n6. The optimized program is as follows:\n   ```rust\n   use std::ptr;\n\n   unsafe fn b() -> ([u32; 28], *mut i8, *mut bool) {\n       let mut c = false;\n       let mut v8 = 13978819448286864680_u64;\n       let mut v9 = 0;\n       let mut v20_decomposed_0: u8 = 197;\n       let mut v20_decomposed_1: u8 = 197;\n       let mut v20_decomposed_2: u8 = 197;\n       let mut v20_decomposed_3: u8 = 197;\n       let mut v20_decomposed_4: u8 = 197;\n       let mut v20_decomposed_5: u8 = 197;\n       let mut v20_decomposed_6: u8 = 197;\n       let mut v20_decomposed_7: u8 = 197;\n       let mut f_0 = false;\n       let mut f_1 = 0;\n       let mut v33_2_ptr;\n       let mut v39: (usize, [u32; 28], ([u32; 6], usize, *mut u32), [u32; 2]) =\n           (0, [0; 28], ([0; 6], 0, ptr::null_mut()), [0; 2]);\n       let ret_0: [u32; 28] = [0; 28];\n       let ret_1: *mut i8 = ptr::null_mut();\n       let ret_2: *mut bool;\n       ret_2 = &mut c;\n       let mut v20_decomposed_ptr;\n       'l0: loop {\n           v20_decomposed_ptr = &mut v20_decomposed[v9];\n           v9 = 2_usize;\n           loop {\n               match *v20_decomposed_ptr {\n                   197 => {\n                       v33_2_ptr = &mut f_0;\n                       'l2: loop {\n                           *v20_decomposed_ptr = 22; // Optimized target\n                           loop {\n                               let e = [\n                                   v20_decomposed_0, v20_decomposed_1, v20_decomposed_2,\n                                   v20_decomposed_3, v20_decomposed_4, v20_decomposed_5,\n                                   v20_decomposed_6, v20_decomposed_7,\n                               ];\n                               match v8 {\n                                   13978819448286864680 => {\n                                       v39.2 .0 = [2262110980_u32; 6];\n                                       v8 = 13152832795211590855_u64;\n                                       v39.0 = 6;\n                                       let d = v33_2_ptr;\n                                       v33_2_ptr = &mut f_0;\n                                       f_1 = *v20_decomposed_ptr;\n                                       *d = true;\n                                       [\n                                           v20_decomposed_0, v20_decomposed_1, v20_decomposed_2,\n                                           v20_decomposed_3, v20_decomposed_4, v20_decomposed_5,\n                                           v20_decomposed_6, v20_decomposed_7,\n                                       ] = e;\n                                       match v39.0 {\n                                           6 => {\n                                               println!(\"{:?}\", (f_0, f_1));\n                                           }\n                                           0 => continue 'l2,\n                                           _ => return (ret_0, ret_1, ret_2),\n                                       }\n                                   }\n                                   _ => continue 'l0,\n                               }\n                           }\n                       }\n                   }\n                   4 => {\n                       v20_decomposed_ptr = &mut v20_decomposed[v9];\n                   }\n                   _ => return (ret_0, ret_1, ret_2),\n               }\n           }\n       }\n   }\n\n   fn main() {\n       unsafe {\n           b();\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n7.
