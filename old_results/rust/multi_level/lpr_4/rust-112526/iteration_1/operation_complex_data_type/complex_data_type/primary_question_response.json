Variables with Simple Data Types:\n   - `isize_min` - It is an `isize`.\n   - `_46` - It is an `i32`.\n   - `_47` - It is an `u8`.\n   - `_88` - It is an `usize`.\n   - `_31` - It is a pointer (`*mut u8`).\n   - `_33` - It is a pointer (`*mut *mut i64`).\n   - `_90` - It is a pointer (`*mut u8`).\n   - `_95` - It is a complex structure with the following nested types:\n     - `_95.0` - It is a structure.\n       - `_95.0 .0` - It is a structure.\n         - `_95.0 .0 .2` - It is a field of type `u8`.\n       - `_95.0 .1` - It is a `bool`.\n\nBased on the analysis, the variables with complex data types are `result` and `tup`.
