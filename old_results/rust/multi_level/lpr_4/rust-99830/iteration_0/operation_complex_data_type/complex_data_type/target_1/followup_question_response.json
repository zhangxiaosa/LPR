In this case, the only complex data type is the `struct d(u32)`.\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis of the program:\n\n1. Import the `Primes` struct from the `primal_sieve` module.\n2. Import the `Add` and `MulAssign` traits from the `std::ops` module.\n3. Define the `main` function.\n4. Initialize a mutable variable `c` of type `d` with the value `d(1)`.\n5. Iterate over the prime numbers up to 4.\n\t- Convert each prime number to `u32` type and bind it to the variable `e`.\n\t- Calculate `f` as the integer division of `4` by `e`.\n\t- Multiply `c` with the result of `(d(e).pow(2 * f) + d(1))`.\n6. Assert that the value of `c.0` is equal to `650`.\n7. Define the `d` struct and implement the `Clone` and `Copy` traits for it.\n8. Implement the `Add` trait for the `d` struct so that it can be used with the `+` operator.\n\t- The `Add` implementation adds the values of `self.0` and `h.0` and returns a new `d` instance with the result.\n9. Implement the `MulAssign` trait for the `d` struct so that it can be used with the `*=` operator.\n\t- The `MulAssign` implementation multiplies `self.0` with `h.0` using inline assembly code.\n10. Implement additional methods for the `d` struct:\n\t- `g` is a constant associated with the `d` struct.\n\t- `pow` calculates the power of a `d` instance using bitwise operations.\n\nBased on the analysis, here's the modified program with the decomposition into primary data type variables:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"program\": \"use primal_sieve::Primes;\\n\\nfn main() {\\n    let mut c = 1u32;\\n    Primes::all().take_while(|&e| e < 4).for_each(|e| {\\n        let e = e as u32;\\n        let f = 4 / e;\\n        c *= e.pow(2 * f) + 1;\\n    });\\n    assert_eq!(c, 650);\\n}\\n\\n#[derive(Clone, Copy)]\\nstruct d(u32);\\n\\nimpl d {\\n    const g: u32 = 1000000000;\\n}\\n\\nimpl d {\\n    fn pow(self, mut exp: u32) -> u32 {\\n        let mut base = self;\\n        base *= base;\\n        exp >>= 1;\\n        let mut acc = base;\\n        exp >>= 1;\\n        base *= base;\\n        if exp == 1 {\\n            acc *= base;\\n        }\\n        acc\\n    }\\n}\\n\"\n}\n```\n\nThe modified program separates the `d` struct into its primary data type, `u32`.
