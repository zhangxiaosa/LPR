The `d` struct also has a method `pow` that computes the power of `self` raised to the given exponent.\n\n6. The `main` function initializes a variable `c` of type `d` with the value `1`.\n\n7. It then uses the `Primes::all()` iterator, which generates all prime numbers, and chains method calls to `take_while` and `for_each` to perform computations on each prime number.\n\n8. The `take_while` method limits the number of primes to those less than 4.\n\n9. The `for_each` method applies a closure to each prime number, multiplying `c` by the result of calling `pow` with a computed exponent based on the prime number.\n\n10.

Therefore, the decomposition results in:\n\n1. `c` becomes `c: u32 = 1`.\n2. The closure `_e` within the `for_each` method becomes `_e: u32`.\n3. The result of `_e as u32` within the closure becomes `_e_converted: u32`.\n4. The constant `1` used in `d(1)` becomes `constant_one: u32`.\n5.
