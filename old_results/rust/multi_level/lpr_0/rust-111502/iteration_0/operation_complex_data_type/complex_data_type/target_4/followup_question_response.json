Declare the `c` function, which returns a boolean value:\n```rust\nfn c() -> bool {\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\n2. Declare the variable `a` as a tuple with elements of type `f32` and `bool`, using a float literal `0.0` and boolean literal `true`:\n```rust\nlet mut a = (0.0, true);\n```\n\n3. Declare the variable `b` as a tuple with elements of type `f32` and `bool`, using a float literal `0.0` and boolean literal `false`:\n```rust\nlet b = (0.0, false);\n```\n\n4. Access the mutable address of `a` using the `core::ptr::addr_of_mut!` macro and store it in variable `d`. The `d` variable is a tuple with elements of type `&mut (f32, bool)` and `(f32, bool)`, respectively:\n```rust\nlet d = (core::ptr::addr_of_mut!(a), b);\n```\n\n5. Make a call to the unsafe function `f`, passing the mutable address of `a` as the first argument `k`, `d` as the second argument, and two boolean literals `true` as the third and fourth arguments. Store the return value of `f` in variable `e`, which has type `bool`:\n```rust\nlet e = unsafe { f(d.0, d, true, true) };\n```\n\n6. Return the value of `e` from the `c` function:\n```rust\nreturn e;\n```\n\n7. Declare the unsafe function `f`, which takes arguments `k` with type `*mut (f32, bool)`, `d` with type `(*mut (f32, bool), (f64, bool))`, `g` with type `bool`, and `h` with type `bool`.
