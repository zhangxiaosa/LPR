The nested tuple `d.1.1` is assigned to `i`, which is an address pointer to the boolean value.\n5. The boolean value `g` is assigned to `j`.\n6.

Since `a` is not used further in the program, we can simplify the expression to `((), (0., false))` by removing the unnecessary pointer value. The assignment becomes `let d = ((), (0., false));`.\n\n2. In the `unsafe fn f(...) -> bool` function, `d` is not used except for the statement `d;`. Since `d` is not modified or used anywhere else in the function, this statement does nothing. We can remove it.\n\n3.

The variable `d` is initialized with the expression `(core::ptr::addr_of_mut!(a), (0., false))`. The first element of `d` is the address of variable `a`. Since `a` is a local variable but never modified after its initialization, its address can be considered constant.\n\n2. The function `f` is called with the arguments `d.0`, `d`, `true`, and `true`. In this case, `d.0` represents the address of `a`, which is constant. Therefore, the first argument can be replaced with a constant.\n\n3. Inside the function `f`, the expression `core::ptr::addr_of!(d.1 .1)` is used to get the address of the second element of `d`. However, since `d` is a constant tuple, the address of its elements can be considered constant as well.\n\n4. The value of `g` is assigned to the dereferenced pointer `i`. Since `g` is a constant, the assignment can be replaced with a constant.\n\n5. The variable `d` is unused after the assignment to `i`. Therefore, it can be optimized out.\n\n6. The function `f` returns `d.1 .1`. Since `d` is constant and `d.1 .1` is constant as well, the return value can be replaced with a constant.\n\n7. The variable `e` in the `c` function is assigned the result of `f`. Since the return value of `f` is constant, the assignment can be replaced with a constant.\n\n8. The `return` statement in the `c` function returns the value of `e`. Since `e` is constant, the return statement can be replaced with a constant.\n\n9.
