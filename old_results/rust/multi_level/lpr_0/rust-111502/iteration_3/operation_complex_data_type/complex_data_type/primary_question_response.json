The program defines a function `c` that returns a value of type `f64`.\n2. Inside the `c` function, a mutable variable `a` of type `f64` is declared and initialized to 0.0.\n3. A `unsafe` block is used where the `f` function is called with an argument `(&mut a, (0.0, 0.0))`. The argument is a tuple containing a mutable reference to `a` and another tuple of two `f64` values.\n4. The `f` function is defined as an `unsafe` function that takes a parameter `d` of type `(*mut f64, (f64, f64))` which is a tuple containing a mutable raw pointer to an `f64` and another tuple of two `f64` values.\n5. Inside the `f` function, the `addr_of!` macro from the `core::ptr` module is used to get the address of the second value (`d.1 .1`) in the second tuple. The resulting address is cast to a mutable raw pointer `*mut f64` and assigned to the variable `i`.\n6. The value pointed to by `i` is updated to 1.0 using the dereference operator `*`.\n7.
