The variable `d_1_1` is declared and assigned the value `false`.\n2. The function `c()` calls the unsafe function `f()` and passes `d_1_1` as an argument.\n3. Inside the `f()` function, the address of `d.1.1` is taken and stored in variable `i`.\n4. The value of `d.1.1` is changed to `true` by dereferencing `i`.\n5. The program then returns the value of `d.1.1`.\n6. Finally, the `c()` function is called within the `main()` function, and the value returned by `c()` is printed.\n\nTo optimize out the variable `d_1_1`:\n\n1. Variable `d_1_1` is not used after being assigned the value `false`.\n2.
