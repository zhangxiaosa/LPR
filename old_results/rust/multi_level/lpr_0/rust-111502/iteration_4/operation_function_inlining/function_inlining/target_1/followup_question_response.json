Here are the steps to perform function inlining on the given program:\n\n1. Start by locating the call site of the target function, `f()`, in the program. In this case, it's called inside the `c()` function.\n\n2. Replace the call site with the body of the target function. In this case, the body of `f()` is as follows:\n   ```rust\n   let i = core::ptr::addr_of!(d.1 .1) as *mut f64;\n   *i = 1.0;\n   d;\n   return d.1 .1;\n   ```\n\n3. Replace the entire call to `f()` in the `c()` function with the body of `f()` to inline the function. The updated `c()` function will be:\n   ```rust\n   fn c() -> f64 {\n       let d = (&mut 0.0, (0.0, 0.0));\n       let i = core::ptr::addr_of!((d.1).1) as *mut f64;\n       *i = 1.0;\n       d;\n       return (d.1).1;\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. Since `c()` is the entry point of the program, make sure to update the `main()` function accordingly to reflect the changes. The updated `main()` function will be:\n   ```rust\n   fn main() {\n       println!(\"{}\", c());\n   }\n   ```\n\n5.
