Here's the step-by-step analysis and modification to optimize the program using function inlining:\n\n1. The target function to be optimized is `c()`.\n\n2. Inlining the `c()` function will replace the function call with the body of the `f()` function.\n\n3. The function `f()` has the following signature: `unsafe fn f(k: *mut f32, d: (*mut f32, (f32, bool)), g: bool, h: bool) -> bool`.\n\n4. The variables `k`, `g`, and `h` in the `f()` function are unused, so they can be removed.\n\n5. The variable `i` can be removed as it is not used after assigning `true` to it.\n\n6. The statement `d;` is redundant and can be removed.\n\n7. The final body of the inlined `c()` function will be:\n```rust\n{\n    let mut a = 0.;\n    let d_1_0 = 0.;\n    let i = core::ptr::addr_of!(d.1 .1) as *mut bool;\n    *i = true;\n    return d.1 .1;\n}\n```\n\n8.
