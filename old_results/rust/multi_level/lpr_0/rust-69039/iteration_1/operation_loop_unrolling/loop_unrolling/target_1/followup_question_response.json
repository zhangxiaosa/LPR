Remove the line `#![feature(generators, generator_trait)]` as it's not necessary for the optimization.\n2. Modify the code to inline the loop manually by calling `resume` method twice without using a loop:\n   ```rust\n   use std::ops::Generator;\n   fn main() {\n       let mut d = Box::pin(|_| {\n           let c = yield \"What is your name?\";\n           yield \"How are you feeling?\";\n       });\n       let e = String::new();\n       match d.as_mut().resume(e) {\n           _ => {}\n       }\n       let e = String::new();\n       match d.as_mut().resume(e) {\n           _ => {}\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n3.

Initialize the generator `d` with the closure `|_| {...}` using `Box::pin()`.\n2. Create a new mutable variable `e` of type `String` and assign it `String::new()`.\n3. Call `d.as_mut().resume(e)` to resume the generator `d` with `e` as the argument.\n4. Discard the result of the call using the match expression, `_ => {}`.\n5.
