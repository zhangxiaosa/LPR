The variable `exp` is initially assigned the value of the function parameter `b` in the `a` function.\n2. The variable `exp` is right-shifted by 1 (divided by 2) multiple times in the `pow` method of the `d` struct. This is followed by some calculations that depend on the value of `exp`.\n3. The final calculation performed on `exp` is a check if it equals 1.\n4. If `exp` is equal to 1, further calculations are performed on other variables and `base` is multiplied by itself, then accumulated in the `acc` variable.\n5. The resulting value of `acc` is returned as the output of the `pow` method.\n\nThe final value of `acc` is eventually used in the main function to compute the output of the program.\n\nLooking at the usage of `exp`, we can see that it is initially assigned the value of `b` and subsequently modified.
