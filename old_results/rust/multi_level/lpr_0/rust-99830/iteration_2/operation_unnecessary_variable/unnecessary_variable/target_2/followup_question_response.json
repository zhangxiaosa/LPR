The variable `e` is first initialized as an element from the iterator `Primes::all().take_while(|&e| e < 4usize)`. Since the condition `e < 4usize` is known at compile-time, we can evaluate the iterator and determine the exact value of `e`.\n\n2. The next usage of `e` is in the expression `e as u32`, where `e` is cast to an `u32`. Since `e` is a constant now, we can evaluate this expression and replace `e` with the resulting constant.\n\n3. Inside the closure passed to `for_each`, `e` is used in the expression `4 / e`. Since `e` is a constant and known at compile-time, we can evaluate this expression and replace `e` with the resulting constant.\n\n4. The expression `2 * (4 / e)` is then used as an exponent for the `pow` method called on `d { 0: e }`. Since `e` and the expression `2 * (4 / e)` are both constants, we can calculate the value of the exponent and replace the code accordingly.\n\n5.
