The target function to be optimized is `d`.\n\nStep 2: Apply constant propagation and copy propagation.\nSince there are no constants or literal values in the program, constant propagation does not apply here. However, we can apply copy propagation to remove the unnecessary variable.\n\nStep 3: Perform copy propagation.\nIn the function `d`, the variable `a` is used to call the function `a` twice. Since there are no other uses of the variable `a`, we can replace all occurrences of `a` with the function call `a()`.
