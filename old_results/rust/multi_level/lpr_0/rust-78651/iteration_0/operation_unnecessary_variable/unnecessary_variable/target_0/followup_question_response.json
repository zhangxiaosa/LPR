There are two options for optimization: constant propagation and copy propagation. Constant propagation replaces the variable with its constant value, while copy propagation replaces the variable with the expression it is assigned to.\n\nIn this case, the variable `result` is not assigned any value, so we cannot perform copy propagation.
