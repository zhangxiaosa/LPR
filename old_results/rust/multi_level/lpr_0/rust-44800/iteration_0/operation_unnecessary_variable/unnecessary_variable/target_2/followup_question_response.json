The variable `data` is initially created as an empty vector with a capacity of 30:\n   ```rust\n   let mut data = Vec::with_capacity(30);\n   ```\n\n2. The value `0b1000_10_00` is pushed twice into the `data` vector.

Three slices `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` are extended into the `data` vector. There are no optimizations possible in this step.\n\n4. Two occurrences of the value `55` are pushed into the `data` vector.

Two more occurrences of the value `0b1000_10_00` are pushed into the `data` vector.

Finally, the `data` vector is extended with the contents of the `fcs` array, which contains a single element `[0xAA]`.

The initial code initializes `data` as an empty `Vec` with a capacity of 30: `let mut data = Vec::with_capacity(30);`.\n\n2. The code then pushes two values (`0b1000_10_00` and `0b1000_10_00`) into `data`.

Following the initial `data` initialization, the code extends `data` with three slices, each containing the values `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.
