This is a macro invocation that does not declare any new variables.\n   - No intermediate or unused variables are present.\n\n2. Next, we have the macro definition: `macro_rules! a { ... }`.\n   - The macro defines a rule that does not declare any new variables.\n   - No intermediate or unused variables are present.\n\n3. Inside the macro rule, we have a pattern: `( ) => { extern crate std as core; };`.\n   - The pattern does not declare any new variables.\n   - No intermediate or unused variables are present.\n\n4. Finally, we have the macro invocation: `a!();`.\n   - The macro invocation does not declare any new variables.\n   - No intermediate or unused variables are present.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that there are no intermediate or unused variables in the given program.
