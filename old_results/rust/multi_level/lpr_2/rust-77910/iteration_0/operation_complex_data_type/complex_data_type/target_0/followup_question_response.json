Inside the function, there is a variable `c` declared but not assigned any value. The function then calls `assert_eq!` macro to compare the variable `a` and `c`.\n\nStep 2: Decomposing Complex Data Type\nTo optimize the variable `b`, which is of type `&i32`, we can decompose it into a primary data type. In this case, the primary data type corresponding to `&i32` is `i32`.
