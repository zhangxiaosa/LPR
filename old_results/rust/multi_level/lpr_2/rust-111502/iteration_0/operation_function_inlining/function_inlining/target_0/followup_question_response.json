The `c()` function calls the `f()` function with the following arguments:\n   - `d.0` (which is the address of `a`)\n   - `d` (the tuple containing `(core::ptr::addr_of_mut!(a), b)`)\n   - `true`\n   - `true`\n\n4. The `f()` function is declared as `unsafe` and takes the following arguments:\n   - `k: *mut (f32, bool)` (a mutable pointer to a tuple of `(f32, bool)`)\n   - `d: (*mut (f32, bool), (f64, bool))` (a tuple of mutable pointer to `(f32, bool)` and a tuple of `(f64, bool)`)\n   - `g: bool`\n   - `h: bool`\n\n5. Inside the `f()` function, the following operations are performed:\n   - `let i = core::ptr::addr_of!(d.1 .1) as *mut bool;` (getting the address of the second boolean in `d.1` tuple)\n   - `let j = g;` (assigning the value of `g` to `j`)\n   - `*i = j;` (dereferencing and assigning the value of `j` to `i`)\n   - `return d.1 .1;` (returning the second boolean value in `d.1`)\n\n6.
