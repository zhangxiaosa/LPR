No modification is needed in this case.\n\n2. The variable `b` is declared with the data type `(0., false)`. Similar to step 1, no modification is required.\n\n3. The variable `d` is declared with the data type `(*mut (f32, bool), (f64, bool))`. Since the target to be optimized is `*mut (f32, bool)`, we need to replace `*mut (f32, bool)` with `(f32, bool)` in the type of `d`. Therefore, the updated type for `d` becomes `((f32, bool), (f64, bool))`.\n\n4. In the `f()` function, the parameter `k` is of type `*mut (f32, bool)`. Following the substitution procedure, we replace `*mut (f32, bool)` with `(f32, bool)`, resulting in the updated type `(&mut (f32, bool), (f64, bool))` for `k`.\n\n5. Similarly, the parameter `d` in the `f()` function has the type `(*mut (f32, bool), (f64, bool))`. After the substitution, `*mut (f32, bool)` gets replaced with `(f32, bool)`, resulting in the updated type `(((f32, bool), (f64, bool)), (f64, bool))` for `d`.\n\n6. In the `f()` function, the variable `i` is declared with the type `*mut bool`. This type does not require modification.\n\n7.
