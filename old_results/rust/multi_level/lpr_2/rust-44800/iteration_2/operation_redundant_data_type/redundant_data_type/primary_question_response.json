It declares a mutable variable named `g_data` and initializes it with a vector containing hexadecimal, binary, and decimal values.\n   4. It declares a variable named `hw` and initializes it with a binary value.\n   5. It declares a variable named `addr` with an explicit type annotation of `u8` and initializes it with the decimal value 1.\n   6. It performs multiple push operations on `k` and `g_data` using various values, including the elements of `g_data` and the variables `hw` and `addr`.\n   7. It reserves exact space in `k` to accommodate the length of `g_data`.\n   8. It prints an empty line.\n   9.

The program includes the line `use std::collections::VecDeque;`, which imports the `VecDeque` data structure from the `std::collections` module.\n\n2. The program defines a mutable variable `k` of type `VecDeque` using the line `let mut k = VecDeque::with_capacity(32);`.\n\n3. The program defines a mutable variable `g_data` and assigns it the value `vec![0x45, 20, 0b1000_10_00, 0b1000_10_00]`. The type of `g_data` is inferred as `Vec<u8>`.\n\n4. The program defines a variable `hw` and assigns it the value `0b1000_10_00`. The type is inferred based on its usage later in the program.\n\n5. The program defines a variable `addr` and explicitly specifies its type as `u8` using the annotation `: u8`.\n\n6. The program pushes values and variables onto the `k` and `g_data` vectors using the `push_front` and `push` methods, respectively.\n\n7. The program calls the `reserve_exact` method on `k`, passing the length of `g_data` as the argument.\n\n8. The program includes the line `println!();`, which prints an empty line to the output.\n\n9. The program extends the `k` vector by passing a reference to an array `[0xD9]` to the `extend` method.\n\nBased on this analysis, there are no redundant data types defined in this program.
