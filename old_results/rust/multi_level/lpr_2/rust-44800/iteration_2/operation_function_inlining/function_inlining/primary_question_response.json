The program imports the `VecDeque` struct from the `std::collections` module.\n2. The `main()` function is defined.\n3. Inside the `main()` function, several variables are declared and initialized:\n   - `k`: A mutable `VecDeque` with a capacity of 32.\n   - `g_data`: A mutable `Vec` containing four elements.\n   - `hw`: An integer value represented in binary.\n   - `addr`: An unsigned 8-bit integer.\n4. Several operations are performed on the `k` and `g_data` variables:\n   - Elements are pushed to the front of `k`.\n   - The first element of `g_data` is pushed to the front of `k`.\n   - Two `hw` values are pushed to the end of `g_data`.\n   - A loop is executed 18 times, pushing the value of `addr` to the end of `g_data`.\n   - Two `55` values and two `hw` values are pushed to the end of `g_data`.\n   - The `reserve_exact()` method is called on `k` with the length of `g_data`.\n   - An empty `println!()` macro is called.\n   - The `extend()` method is called on `k` with a slice containing a single element: `0xD9`.\n5.
