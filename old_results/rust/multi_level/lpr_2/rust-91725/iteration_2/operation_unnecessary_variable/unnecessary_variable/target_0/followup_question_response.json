The variable `l` is assigned the value `0`.\n4. `l` is bitwise ORed with `1` shifted left by the value of `j`. Since `j` is `0`, this operation has no effect.\n5. The variable `result` is assigned based on the value of `l`. If `l` is equal to `0`, `result` becomes `2 * 2` (which is `4`), otherwise `result` becomes `2`.\n6.
