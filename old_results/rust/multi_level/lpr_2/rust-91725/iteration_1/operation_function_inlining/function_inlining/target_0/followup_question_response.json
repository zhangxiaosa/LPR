The target function to be optimized is `g(h: u32, arg: u32) -> u32`.\n2. The function contains a while loop with the condition `2 == 0`, which is always false. This loop can be removed since it will never execute.\n3. The variable `l` is initialized to 0 and then modified with the bitwise OR operation (`l |= 1 << j`). Since `j` is always 0, the result will always be 1. We can replace `l |= 1 << j` with `l = 1`.\n4. The variable `result` is assigned a value based on the value of `l`. If `l` is equal to 0, `result` is assigned `2 * 2`, which is 4. Otherwise, `result` is assigned 2. We can replace the assignment with a conditional expression: `let result = if l == 0 { 4 } else { 2 }`.\n5. The expression `((arg as u64 * result) % h as u64) as u32` can be simplified as `(arg * result % h) as u32` since the intermediate conversions to `u64` are unnecessary.\n6.
