Identify the data type declarations.\n2. Check if each declaration is redundant.\n3. Collect the redundant data types.\n\nNow let's go through these steps for the given program:\n\n1. There is one data type declaration: `let result: Err;`\n2. We need to check if `Err` is a redundant data type.\n3. As `Err` is not a built-in type or a defined type via `typedef`, it appears to be a custom type that should be defined somewhere else in the code. Since we don't have any additional code provided, we can consider it a redundant data type.\n\nTherefore, the identified redundant data type in the program is `Err`.\n\nWe can represent this information in JSON format as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"target_list\": [\"Err\"]\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that the identified redundant data type \"Err\" assumes it is a custom type defined elsewhere in the code.
