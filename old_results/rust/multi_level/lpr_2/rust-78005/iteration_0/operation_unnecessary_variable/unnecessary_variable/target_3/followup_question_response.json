After analyzing the program, check if the `found_target` flag is still `false`. If it is `false`, it means the target variable is never used in the program.\n   - If `found_target` is `false`, the target variable is unused and can be optimized out. Remove the variable declarations from the program.\n   - If `found_target` is `true`, the target variable is used and cannot be optimized out.\n\nThe final optimized program is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"program\": \"fn main() {\\n\\tlet x: isize < isize >;\\n\\n\\tlet x: i16 < isize >;\\n\\tlet x: i32 < isize >;\\n\\tlet x: i64 < isize >;\\n\\tlet x: usize < main >;\\n}\"\n}\n```\n\nThe target variable, `x: i8 < isize >`, is unused in the program.
