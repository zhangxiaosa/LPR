There is an implementation of the `TypeVal` trait for the `b<e, f>` type where `e` is required to implement `TypeVal<c>`.\n4.

Therefore, it's not possible to substitute it with a specific original data type.\n\nHowever, we can modify the program to remove the trait implementation `impl<e, f> TypeVal<usize> for b<e, f> where e: TypeVal<c> {}` if it is deemed unnecessary or incorrect.
