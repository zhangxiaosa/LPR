Variable `b` is already a primary data type (`i32`).\n2. Variable `c` is of type `d`, which is a complex data type.\n   - Decompose `c` into a primary data type variable:\n     ```rust\n     let mut c = 1;\n     ```\n3. `Primes::all()` creates an iterator of prime numbers.\n4. `.take_while(|&e| e < b as usize)` restricts the iterator to elements less than `b`.\n   - Decompose it into a loop:\n     ```rust\n     let mut primes = Primes::all();\n     while let Some(e) = primes.next() {\n         if e >= b as usize {\n             break;\n         }\n         // Rest of the code...\n     }\n     ```\n5.

The `pow` method of the `d` struct performs exponentiation.\n   - Decompose it into a helper function:\n     ```rust\n     fn pow(base: u32, mut exp: u32) -> u32 {\n         let mut result = base;\n         while exp > 1 {\n             result *= result;\n             exp >>= 1;\n         }\n         if exp == 1 {\n             result *= result;\n         }\n         result\n     }\n     ```\n7.
