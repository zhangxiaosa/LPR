The target variable to be optimized is `base`.\n2. In the `pow` method of the `d` struct, the variable `base` is initially assigned the value of `self`.\n3. `base` is then multiplied by itself, and the result is stored in `acc`.\n4. The method performs right shifts on the `exp` variable and performs additional multiplications of `base` by itself for each set bit in the `exp` variable.\n5. If the least significant bit of `exp` is 1 after right shifting, `acc` is multiplied by `base`.\n6. Finally, the method returns the value of `acc`.\n\nOptimization:\n\nSince the value assigned to `base` at the beginning of the `pow` method is never modified before it is returned as `acc`, the optimization can be performed by replacing all occurrences of `base` in the method with `self`.
