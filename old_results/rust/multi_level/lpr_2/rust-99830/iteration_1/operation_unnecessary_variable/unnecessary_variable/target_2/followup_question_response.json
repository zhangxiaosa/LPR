Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:\n\n1. Import the `primal_sieve` crate.\n2. Declare the `main` function.\n3. Declare a variable `b` and initialize it with the value 4.\n4. Declare a mutable variable `c` and initialize it with the result of the `d` function called with argument 1.\n5. Access the `Primes::all()` function from the `primal_sieve` crate. This function returns an iterator over all prime numbers.\n6. Use the `take_while` method on the iterator, passing a closure that takes the element by reference and checks if it's less than `b` as `usize`.\n7. Use the `for_each` method on the iterator, passing a closure that takes the element and performs the following steps:\n    a. Declare a new variable `e` and assign the value of the current element casted to `u32`.\n    b. Declare a new variable `f` and assign the value of `b` divided by `e`.\n    c. Call the `d` function with argument `e` and assign the result to the `base` variable.\n    d. Multiply `c` by the sum of `base` and the result of calling the `d` function with argument 1.\n8. Use the `assert_eq!` macro to check that the field `0` of `c` is equal to 650.\n9. Define the `d` struct and implement the `Clone` and `Copy` traits for it.\n10. Implement a method `pow` for the `d` struct. This method takes a `u32` argument and performs the following steps:\n    a. Declare a mutable variable `exp` and assign the value of the argument.\n    b. Multiply `self` by itself and assign the result to `base`.\n    c. Right shift `exp` by 1.\n    d. Declare a mutable variable `acc` and assign the value of `base`.\n    e. Right shift `exp` by 1.\n    f. Multiply `base` by itself and assign the result to `base`.\n    g. Check if `exp` is equal to 1. If so, multiply `acc` by `base`.\n    h. Return `acc`.\n11. Implement the `Add` trait for the `d` struct. This implementation takes a mutable `self` reference and another `d` value `h` and performs the following steps:\n    a. Add the value of `h.0` to `self.0`.\n    b. Return `self`.\n12. Implement the `MulAssign` trait for the `d` struct. This implementation takes a mutable `self` reference and another `d` value `h` and performs the following steps:\n    a. Use inline assembly to perform a multiplication of `eax` (part of `self`) by `h.0` and store the result in `edx:eax`.\n    b. Use inline assembly to perform a division of `edx:eax` by `G` (a constant from the `d` struct) and store the quotient in `eax` and remainder in `edx`.\n13.
