It represents a value `d` with an underlying primitive data type `u32`.\n2. The constant `G` is defined as `10u32.pow(9)` within the `impl d` block. It can be replaced with a `u32` directly.\n3. The function `pow` is defined within the `impl d` block and operates on the `d` type. It returns a `d` type.
