Declare `g` and `h` as global variables outside the `fn4` function.\n\n3. Remove the `fn4` function as we'll be inlining it.\n\n4. Inside the `main` function, replace the condition `if (fn4(g, g, 0x57638FF4, g))` with the body of the `fn4` function.\n\n5. Replace all occurrences of `g` and `h` in the inlined `fn4` code block with their respective global variable names.\n\n6. Fix the loop control variables:\n   - Replace the loop variable `p4` with `g` in the first and second nested loops.\n   - Remove the third nested loop, as it doesn't seem to serve any purpose.\n\n7.
