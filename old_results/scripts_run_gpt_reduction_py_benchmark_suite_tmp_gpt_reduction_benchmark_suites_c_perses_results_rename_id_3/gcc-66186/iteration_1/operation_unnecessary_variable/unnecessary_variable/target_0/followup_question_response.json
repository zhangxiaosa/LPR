The variable `ak` is an array of `int16_t` with 8 elements.\n2. The loop `for (; p2 <= 7; p2 += 1)` iterates over the indices of the `ak` array.\n3. Inside the loop, there is another loop `for (p4 = 0; p4 <= 7; p4 += 1)` that iterates over the indices of the `ak` array.\n4. The `if (ak[p3])` condition checks if the element at index `p3` of the `ak` array is nonzero.\n5. If the condition is true, the inner loop is terminated using the `break` statement.\n6.
