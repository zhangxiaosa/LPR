The program has three variables declared: `g` of type `int`, `h2` of type `int`, and `i` of type `int`.\n2. `h2` and `i` are assigned hexadecimal values.\n3. The program includes a function `fn2()` which has a local variable `r` declared as a 3-dimensional array of `int`.\n4. Inside the `fn2()` function, there is a loop that runs indefinitely.\n5. Inside the loop, if the value of `h2` is nonzero, the function returns the hexadecimal value `0xC3L`.\n6. Otherwise, the value of `g` is updated by assigning a value from the 3-dimensional array `r` based on the value of `i`.\n7.
