Constant Propagation:\n   - The initial value of `d` is 2.\n   - Inside the loop, the value of `v_value` is always updated with the current value of `d`. Since `d` is constant, we can assign the constant value directly to `v_value`.\n   - Therefore, the statement `v_value = d` can be replaced with `v_value = 2`.\n\n2. Copy Propagation:\n   - After applying constant propagation, the statement `d = fn2(v_value = d)` becomes `d = fn2(v_value = 2)`.\n   - Since `v_value` is no longer used after the loop, we can propagate the value of `v_value` directly into the statement `d = fn2(2)`.\n   - Therefore, the statement `d = fn2(2)` can be replaced with `d = 2`.\n\n3.
