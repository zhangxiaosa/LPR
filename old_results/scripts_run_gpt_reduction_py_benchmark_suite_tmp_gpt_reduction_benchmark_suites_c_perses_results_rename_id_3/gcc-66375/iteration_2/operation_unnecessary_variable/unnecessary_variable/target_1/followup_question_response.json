In this case, the variable `p1` is passed as an argument to the function `fn2(p1)`, but its value is not modified or used within the function. Therefore, we can optimize it out by copy propagation.\n\nHere's the step-by-step analysis and optimization:\n\n1. The function `fn2(p1)` doesn't modify or use the argument `p1`.
