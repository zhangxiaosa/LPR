Since the loop body does not contain any statements other than `q -= 1`, we can simply replace the loop with multiple instances of `q -= 1`. \n\nBased on the requirement to optimize the loop, let's unroll the loop 6 times, as in the original program.

As a result, the program directly performs the required number of iterations without checking the condition repeatedly.
