Modify the function `fn9` to optimize the assignment of `w`:\n   - Replace `w = 1` with `w = 254` to initialize `w` with the constant value directly.\n   - Since the value of `w` is constant, the loop `for (; i < 5; i++)` becomes an infinite loop as `i` does not change.\n   - Remove the loop `for (; i < 5; i++)` and update the loop `for (af = 6; af >= 0; af -= 1)` to `for (af = 6; af >= 0; af--)` to decrement `af` by 1 in each iteration.\n\n4.
