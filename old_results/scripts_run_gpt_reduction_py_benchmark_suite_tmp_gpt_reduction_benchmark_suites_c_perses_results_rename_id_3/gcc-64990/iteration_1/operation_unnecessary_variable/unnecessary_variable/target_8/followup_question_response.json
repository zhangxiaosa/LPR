The `main` function calls the `fn3` function.\n2. The `fn3` function calls the `fn1` function with arguments `fn2(0)`, `7`, and `0`. The return value of `fn1` is not used.\n3. The `fn1` function checks if `p1` is true. If it is false, it assigns 0 to `m[1][0][1]`. The return value of `fn1` is always 2.\n4. The `fn2` function takes a single argument (`p1`) but does not use it. It defines a local variable `v` and initializes it but does not use it either. It has a loop with an unconditional break statement, so it will always break on the first iteration. After the loop, it checks if `h` is true (which is always false) and returns a value from `j_new[g][g]` or a constant value 0x709BFC8A. The return value is also not used.\n5.
