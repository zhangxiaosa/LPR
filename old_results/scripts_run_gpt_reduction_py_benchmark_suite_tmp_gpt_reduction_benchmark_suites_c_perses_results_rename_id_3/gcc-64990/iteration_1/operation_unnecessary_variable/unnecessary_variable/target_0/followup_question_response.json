Let's analyze the program and identify how it can be optimized through constant propagation or copy propagation.\n\n1. The program starts with the declaration of various variables, including `g`, `h`, `i`, `j_new`, `k`, `l`, `m`, and `n`.\n2. The function `fn3` calls `fn1` with arguments `fn2(0)`, `7`, `7`, and `0`. Afterward, it returns the value of `n`.\n3. The function `fn1` performs a logical OR operation between `p1` and an assignment operation to `m[1][0][1]`. The result is not used, so the assignment can be optimized out.\n4. The function `fn1` returns the constant value `2`.\n5. The function `fn2` initializes a local array `v`, but it is not used subsequently in the function.\n6. The function `fn2` contains a loop that breaks when `k` is non-zero. Inside the loop, the function returns an element from the array `v` based on the values of `g`, `l`, and `h`. However, since `v` is not used elsewhere and the return value is not used, this can be optimized out.\n7. The function `fn2` returns the constant value `0x709BFC8A`.\n8. The `main` function simply calls `fn3`.\n\nTo optimize out the target variable `i`, we can remove all assignments to `i` and its subsequent uses since it remains unused throughout the program.
