The variable `n` is initialized but never used. Therefore, we can safely remove any assignments to `n` and optimize it out.\n2. In the `fn3` function, the `fn1` function is called with arguments `fn2(0), 7, 7, 0`. The return value of `fn1` is ignored, and the function simply returns the value of `n`. Since `n` is never modified, and its value is not used anywhere, we can optimize out the function call and replace it with a direct return statement of `n`.\n3. In the `fn1` function, the assignment `m[1][0][1] = 0` is conditional on the value of `p1`. However, `p1` is a signed variable, and checking its truthiness in the `p1 || (m[1][0][1] = 0)` expression does not affect any control flow. Therefore, we can optimize out this assignment statement.\n4. In the `fn2` function, the `for` loop has an empty body. This loop does not affect the control flow, so we can remove the loop entirely.\n5. After applying the above optimizations, we are left with an empty `main` function.
