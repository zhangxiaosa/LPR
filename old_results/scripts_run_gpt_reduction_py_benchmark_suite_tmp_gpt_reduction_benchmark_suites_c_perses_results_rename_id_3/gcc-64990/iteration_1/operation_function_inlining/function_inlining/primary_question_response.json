The program starts with the declaration of global variables: g, h, i, j, k, l, m, and n.\n2. Next, there are function declarations: fn1, fn2, and fn3.\n3. The fn3 function is defined as follows:\n   - It calls the fn1 function with arguments fn2(0), 7, 7, and 0.\n   - It returns the value of the global variable n.\n4. The fn1 function is defined as follows:\n   - It performs a logical OR operation between p1 and m[1][0][1].\n   - It returns the value 2.\n5. The fn2 function is defined as follows:\n   - It declares a local variable v.\n   - It enters an infinite loop with an empty body (no operation).\n   - Inside the loop, it checks the value of the global variable k and breaks the loop if it is true.\n   - It returns the value v[g][l + 1][l].\n   - If the value of the global variable h is true, it performs an empty statement.\n   - Otherwise, it returns the value of j[g][g].\n   - It then enters another loop with an empty body (no operation).\n   - Finally, it returns the value 0x709BFC8A.\n6.
