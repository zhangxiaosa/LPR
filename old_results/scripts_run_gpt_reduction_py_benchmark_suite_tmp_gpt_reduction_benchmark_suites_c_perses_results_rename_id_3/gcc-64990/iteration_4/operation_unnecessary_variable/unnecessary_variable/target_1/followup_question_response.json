This usage can potentially be optimized out if `l` is a constant value.\n\n2. Evaluate the constants:\n   - The constant value of `g` is `0x7EBA`.\n   - The constant value of `h` is `0xCA`.\n\n3. Optimize variable `l` using constant propagation and copy propagation:\n   - Since `l` is not assigned any value in the program, it is initially uninitialized and effectively unused.

Here is the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. Constant propagation:\n   - The value of variable `h` is `0xCA`.\n   - The value of variable `i` is not assigned explicitly in the given code, so we don't have enough information to propagate a constant value.\n   - The value of variable `g` is `0x7EBA`.\n   - The value of variable `j_old[1][0]` is assigned conditionally based on `p1` in `fn1`. We don't have enough information to propagate its value.\n\n2. Copy propagation:\n   - In `fn2`, if `i == 1`, the value of `v_1[g][l][l]` is returned. Since `i` is not assigned explicitly, we cannot determine if `i` is equal to 1. Hence, we cannot perform copy propagation for this case.\n   - In the `else` condition of `fn2`, the value of `j_old[g][g]` is returned. We can perform copy propagation for `l` if it is used as an array index. However, `l` is not used as an index in this case, so we cannot optimize `l` using copy propagation.\n\n3.
