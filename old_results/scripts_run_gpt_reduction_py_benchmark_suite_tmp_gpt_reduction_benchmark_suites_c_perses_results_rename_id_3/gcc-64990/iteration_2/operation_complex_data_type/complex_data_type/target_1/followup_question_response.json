The program also includes three functions: `fn1`, `fn2`, and `fn3`.\n4. `fn1` takes two integer parameters `p1` and `p2`, performs a logical OR operation on `p1` and sets `m[1][0][1]` to 0 if the result is non-zero. It returns the value 2.\n5. `fn2` takes one integer parameter `p1`. It has a local array variable `v` of type `unsigned[6][3][2]`. It contains a loop that initializes `i` to 0, and if `k` is non-zero, it breaks out of the loop and returns a value from `v`. If `h` is non-zero, it returns a value from `j_new`. Otherwise, it has an empty loop and finally returns a constant value.\n6. `fn3` doesn't take any parameters. It calls `fn1` with the result of calling `fn2` with parameters 0 and 7.
