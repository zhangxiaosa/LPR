If `p1` can be determined as false during compile-time, the loop can be completely removed.\n\n2. Assuming that `p1` cannot be statically determined, we'll unroll the loop by replicating its body 4 times. This number can be adjusted based on the desired degree of loop unrolling.

Inside the loop, there are no statements or operations that modify the value of `p1`. So, as long as `p1` remains constant throughout the loop, we can unroll the loop by manually repeating the loop body.\n3. We'll assume the loop body has no break statement or any other means of early termination.
