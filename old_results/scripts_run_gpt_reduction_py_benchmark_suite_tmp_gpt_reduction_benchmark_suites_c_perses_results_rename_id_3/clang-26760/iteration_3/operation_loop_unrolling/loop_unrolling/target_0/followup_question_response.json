The target optimization is to optimize out the `goto q;` statement.\n\n3. To achieve this, we can unroll the loop and convert it into equivalent sequential statements.\n\n4. We observe that the loop consists of two statements:\n\n   - `k = k >> 1L;`\n   - `k = k << j;`\n\n5. The loop is conditioned on `if (g)`, so we need to determine the initial value of `g` to determine whether the loop will run or not.\n\n6. Since the initial value of `g` is not given in the code snippet, we can assume it to be `0` to analyze the program without any specific input.\n\n7. Now, let's unroll the loop by replacing the `goto q;` statement with the equivalent sequential statements:\n\n   ```c\n   unsigned g;\n   int main() {\n     unsigned j = 0x24F96B7BL;\n     unsigned k;\n     if (j)\n       --j;\n   q:\n     k = k >> 1L;\n     if (g) {\n       k = k << j;\n       k = k >> 1L;\n       if (g) {\n         k = k << j;\n         k = k >> 1L;\n         if (g) {\n           k = k << j;\n           // Repeat this block for the required number of unrolls\n         }\n       }\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n8. The number of unrolls depends on the specific optimization goal and target system constraints. In this case, you can determine the desired number of unrolls based on the program's performance requirements and other factors.\n\n9. The final unrolled program will have multiple repetitions of the `k = k << j;` statement, each followed by `k = k >> 1L;`.\n\n10.
