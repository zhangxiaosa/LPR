The program declares an unsigned global variable `g`.\n2.

The `main` function is defined and is empty.\n\nThe target variable to be optimized is `g`.\n\nTo optimize out variables using constant propagation, we need to find instances where the value of `g` is known at compile-time, and replace all occurrences of `g` with its constant value.

Additionally, the `k` variable and the label `q` are also not used, so they are removed. The `fn1` function only declares `j` and `m`, initializes `j` with a constant value, and returns 0.
