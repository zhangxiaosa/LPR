The target data type to be optimized is unsigned.\n2. The program includes a declaration of an integer variable 'g' of type int.\n3. The program also contains a function named 'fn1' with a return type of unsigned.\n4. Inside the 'fn1' function, there are several unsigned variables declared: 'j', 'k', 'm', and 'n'.\n5. The variable 'j' is assigned the hexadecimal value 0x24F96B7B.\n6. There is an if statement checking the value of 'j' and decrementing it by 1 if it is nonzero.\n7. 'm' is assigned the value of 'j'.\n8. 'n' is assigned the value of 'g'.\n9. There is a label 'q' and a shift operation on 'k' using the bitwise right shift operator.\n10. There is another if statement checking the value of 'n' and performing a left shift operation on 'k' using the value of 'm' if 'n' is nonzero. The program then jumps to label 'q'.\n11.

The target to be optimized is `unsigned`, so we need to find and eliminate the identifier `unsigned` and substitute it with its associated original data type, which is `int`.\n\n2. Identify and modify the declarations and variable assignments that use the `unsigned` data type:\n\n   - Change `unsigned j = 0x24F96B7BL;` to `int j = 0x24F96B7B;`.\n   - Change `unsigned k;` to `int k;`.\n   - Change `unsigned m = j;` to `int m = j;`.\n   - Change `unsigned n = g;` to `int n = g;`.\n\n3. Remove the `unsigned` statement before the function name `fn1()`.\n\n4. Modify the `goto` statement to replace the label `q` with another identifier. For example, change `goto q;` to `goto loop;`.\n\n5. After performing the above steps, the modified program is as follows:\n\n```cpp\nint g;\n\nint fn1() {\n  int j = 0x24F96B7B;\n  int k;\n  if (j)\n    --j;\n  int m = j;\n  int n = g;\nloop:\n  k = k >> 1L;\n  if (n) {\n    k = k << m;\n    goto loop;\n  }\n}\n\nint main() {}\n```\n\n6.
