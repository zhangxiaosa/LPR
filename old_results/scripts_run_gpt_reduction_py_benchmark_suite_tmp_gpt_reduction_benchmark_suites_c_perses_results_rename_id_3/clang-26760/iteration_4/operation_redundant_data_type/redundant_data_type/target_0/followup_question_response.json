The target data type to optimize is `unsigned int`, which is the original data type associated with the variable `g`. We'll substitute every instance of `g` with `unsigned int`.\n\n2. The program declares an unsigned integer variable `j` and initializes it with the hexadecimal value `0x24F96B7B`.\n\n3. The program declares an unsigned integer variable `k` without initializing it.\n\n4. The program checks if `j` is non-zero. If it is, it decrements `j` by 1.\n\n5.
