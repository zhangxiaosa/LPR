After the nested loops, there are two statements:\n   - The statement `int l = 1L;` initializes the local variable `l` with the long value `1L`.\n   - The statement `int m = j;` initializes the local variable `m` with the value of `j`.\n9. The label `q` is defined again as a standalone label followed by a semicolon `:;`. It serves as a destination for the `goto` statement.\n10. The variable `k` is right-shifted by the value of `l`.\n11. The variable `i` is assigned the value of `p`.\n12. There is an `if` statement that checks the truthiness of `i`.
