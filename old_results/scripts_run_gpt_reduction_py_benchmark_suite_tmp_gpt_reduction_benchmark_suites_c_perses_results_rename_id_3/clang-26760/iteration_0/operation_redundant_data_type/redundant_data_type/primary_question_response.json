After the typedef statements, we have variable declarations:\n   - d f;\n   - a g;\n\n3. Next, there is a function definition for fn1, which returns a value of type b. Inside the function, we have the following variable declarations:\n   - a i;\n   - c j = 0x24F96B7BL; (initialized with a hexadecimal value)\n   - e k;\n\n4. Following the variable declarations, there are two nested for loops and some assignments to variables.\n   - Within the loops, we also have assignment statements:\n     - c l = 1L; (initialized with a long integer value)\n     - c m = j;\n     - a n = g;\n     - c o = n;\n     - e p = o;\n\n5.
