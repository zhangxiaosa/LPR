The program defines a function `fn6_p1` that takes two parameters (`p1` and `p2`) of type `short` and returns a `short` value. The function subtracts `p2` from `p1` and returns the result.\n4. The program defines the `main` function, the entry point of the program:\n   - It declares the following variables:\n     - `an` of type `int`\n     - `ao` of type `short` initialized with the hexadecimal value `0xBCD1`\n   - It starts a `for` loop with the variable `w` initialized to `3` and continues as long as `w` is non-zero.
