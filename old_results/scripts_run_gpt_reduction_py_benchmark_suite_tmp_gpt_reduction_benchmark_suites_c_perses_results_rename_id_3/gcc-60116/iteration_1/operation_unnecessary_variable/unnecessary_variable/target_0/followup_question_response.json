The variable `ag_3` is assigned the value of `au_0[4][1][5]`, which is determined by the expression `fn8(~fn4(fn3(aj, fn2(ap, 1L)) != 0, an), ak) && 0x57L)`. We need to evaluate this expression and replace `ag_3` with the computed value.\n\n2. Evaluate the expression `fn3(aj, fn2(ap, 1L)) != 0`:\n   - `fn2(ap, 1L)` returns the result of performing the modulo operation (`ap % 1L`). Since `1L` is a constant value, this operation will always return 0. Therefore, the expression becomes `fn3(aj, 0) != 0`.\n   - `fn3(aj, 0)` always returns the second argument, which is 0. Hence, the expression simplifies to `0 != 0`, which is false.\n\n3. Evaluate the expression `fn4(false, an)`:\n   - Since the first argument is false, the expression simplifies to `false`.\n\n4. Evaluate the expression `fn8(false, ak) && 0x57L`:\n   - Since the first argument is false, the expression evaluates to false (`0`) regardless of the value of `ak`.\n\n5. Replace the assignment to `ag_3` (`ag_3 = au_0[4][1][5]`) with the computed value, which is `0`.\n\n6. The variable `ag_3` is no longer used after the optimization.
