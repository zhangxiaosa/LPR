The target variable to be optimized is `am`.\n\n2. We need to identify all the occurrences of variable `am` in the program and analyze their usage.\n\n3. In the function `fn12()`, there is a condition `fn8(~fn4(fn3(0, fn2(ap, 1L)) != 0, an), ak) && 0x57L` where the result is assigned to `au_0[4][1][5]`. If this condition is true (`!= 0`), then the value of `ak` is propagated to `am`. Otherwise, `au_0[4][1][5]` is assigned to `ao`.\n\n4. Since we are only interested in the constant propagation and copy propagation, we can assume that the condition `fn3(0, fn2(ap, 1L)) != 0` is always true, which means it will not affect the value of `am`.\n\n5. Therefore, we can conclude that `am = ak` in the assignment `au_0[4][1][5] = fn8(~fn4(true, an), ak) && 0x57L`.\n\n6. Since the value of `am` is constant and it is assigned to `v` in the same function `fn12()`, the assignment `v = am;` can be optimized out by copy propagation.\n\n7.

The result of the function call `fn6` is used as an argument in the function call `fn7(4UL, ...)`.\n5. The result of the function call `fn7` is compared with `2` in the condition `(w >= ... > 2)`.\n6. If the condition is true, `am` is assigned to `v` and `au_0[4][1][5]`.\n7. If the condition is false, `am` is not assigned to any variable.\n8. Finally, the value of `v` is assigned to `q` and printed as the checksum.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can see that `am` is only used within the condition of the `if` statement in the `fn12` function.

In the `fn12()` function, `am` is used in the condition:\n   ```c\n   if (w >= (fn7(4UL, fn6(aq, fn5(ai, au_0[4][1][5] = fn8(~fn4(fn3(0, fn2(ap, 1L)) != 0, an), ak) && 0x57L))) > 2)) {\n     v = am;\n     ag_3 = au_0[4][1][5];\n   } else {\n     ao = au_0[4][1][5];\n   }\n   ```\n   Here, `am` is passed as an argument to the `fn8()` function. Since constant propagation evaluates constant expressions at compile-time, we can replace `am` with its constant value `0x41AEA787L` within the call to `fn8()`.\n\n   The modified condition becomes:\n   ```c\n   if (w >= (fn7(4UL, fn6(aq, fn5(ai, au_0[4][1][5] = fn8(~fn4(fn3(0, fn2(ap, 1L)) != 0, 0x41AEA787L), ak) && 0x57L))) > 2)) {\n     v = am;\n     ag_3 = au_0[4][1][5];\n   } else {\n     ao = au_0[4][1][5];\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. Since the modified condition depends on the value of `am`, we need to track its value. However, in this case, the value of `am` does not change within the loop in `fn12()`.\n\n4. After the loop ends in `fn12()`, the value of `am` is assigned to `v`:\n   ```c\n   v = am;\n   ```\n\n5.
