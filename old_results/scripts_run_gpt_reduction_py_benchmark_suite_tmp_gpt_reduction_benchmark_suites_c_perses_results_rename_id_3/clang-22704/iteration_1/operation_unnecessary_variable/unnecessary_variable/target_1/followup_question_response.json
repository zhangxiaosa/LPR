Assuming there is no external modification of `fe` in the program, we can consider it uninitialized by default.\n   - Inside the `if` statement, `fd` is assigned a constant value of `6L`.\n   - The `fn1()` function is then recursively called.\n   - After the recursive call to `fn1()`, the function returns 0.\n   - Outside the `if` statement, `fn1()` is called again, and the function returns 0.\n3. Moving to the `main()` function, it is empty and doesn't make any use of the `fe` variable.\n4.
