Function Definitions:\n   - `int fn3(int p1, int p2)`: A function that takes two integer parameters `p1` and `p2` and returns an integer.\n   - `static short fn7(short p1)`: A static function that takes a short integer parameter `p1` and returns a short integer.\n   - `static void fn8()`: A static function that does not take any parameters and does not return a value.\n\n4. Function `fn3`:\n   - The function `fn3` performs a conditional check and returns `p1` if `p2` is zero or if `p1` is non-zero and `p2` is non-zero. Otherwise, it returns the modulo of `p1` and `p2`.\n\n5. Function `fn7`:\n   - The function `fn7` takes `p1` as a parameter and performs the following operations:\n     - It calls `fn3` with `p1` and global variable `q` as arguments, and assigns the return value to the local variable `ac`.\n     - It checks if the global variable `s` is non-zero.\n     - If `s` is non-zero, it enters a loop where it performs the following steps:\n       - Decrements `p1` by 1.\n       - Initializes a local unsigned integer `ah` to 0.\n       - Executes a nested if-else statement.\n       - Updates `p1` based on a complex expression involving `fn3`, bitwise operations, and comparison with a constant.\n       - Updates the global variable `p` with the value of `p1`.\n       - Updates `ac` by calling `fn3` with a constant and accessing an element from the global array `u`.\n     - If `s` is zero, it assigns the result of calling `fn3` with constants to an element in the global array `t`.\n\n6.
