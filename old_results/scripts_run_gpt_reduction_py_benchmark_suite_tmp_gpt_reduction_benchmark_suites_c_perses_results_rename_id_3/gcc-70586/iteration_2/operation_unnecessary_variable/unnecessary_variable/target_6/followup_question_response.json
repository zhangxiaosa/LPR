Variable declarations:\n   - `short p`: A short integer variable.\n   - `short q`: A short integer variable.\n   - `unsigned s = 0x03F238A4L`: An unsigned integer variable initialized with a hexadecimal value.\n   - `unsigned t[7][1]`: An unsigned integer 2D array with dimensions 7x1.\n   - `short u[6]`: A short integer array with 6 elements.\n\n2.
