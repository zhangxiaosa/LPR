In the `fn3` function, the return value is determined based on the values of `p1` and `p2`. If `p2 == 0` or `p1 && p2` is true, then the return value is `p1`, otherwise `p1 % p2`.\n4. In the main function, `fn7(1)` is called.

Start with the given program and identify the target variable to be optimized, which is `ac`.\n\n2. Perform constant propagation and copy propagation to optimize the usage of `ac` within the program.\n\n3. Since `ac` is initially assigned the value of `fn3(p1, q)`, we need to analyze the `fn3()` function to determine if constant propagation or copy propagation is possible.\n\n4. The `fn3()` function returns `p1` if either `p2` is zero or `p1` and `p2` are non-zero. Otherwise, it returns `p1 % p2`.\n\n5. In the `fn7()` function, `ac` is assigned the value of `fn3(p1, q)`. Since `ac` is used within an `if` statement, and `fn3()` can return different values depending on the conditions, constant propagation is not possible.\n\n6. However, within the `else` block of the `if` statement, `ac` is assigned the value of `ah`, which is derived from `fn3(p1, q)`. Since `ah` is not used anywhere else, we can optimize the assignment of `ac` by replacing it with `fn3(p1, q)`.\n\n7.
