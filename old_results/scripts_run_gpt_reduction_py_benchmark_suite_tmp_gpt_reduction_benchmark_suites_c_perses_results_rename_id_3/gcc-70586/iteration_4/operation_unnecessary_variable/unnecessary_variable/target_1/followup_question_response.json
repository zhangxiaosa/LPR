In the function `fn7`, there is an `if` statement that checks the value of `s`. If `s` is non-zero, the code inside the `if` block is executed; otherwise, the code inside the `else` block is executed. The variable `ah` is re-declared inside the `if` block, which shadows the outer declaration of `ah`.\n2. Inside the `if` block, there is an `if` statement with a condition `p1, p1 + p1 || p1 && fn3(p1, 0xBC2AB98CL)`. Since `p1` is non-zero, the `p1 + p1` part is always non-zero. The condition becomes `p1, 1`, which is equivalent to just `p1`. Therefore, we can optimize the `if` statement to `if (p1)`. This eliminates the need for the `else` block.\n3. Inside the modified `if` block, the statement `ah = ac;` is executed unconditionally. Therefore, we can optimize out the `if` statement entirely and directly assign `ac` to `ah`.\n4. The variable `ah` is only used in the statement `p1 = (0x60781BCDL >= fn3(fn3(p1, p1) > 0xB5L, p1) != p1 ^ 4294967287UL) - ah;`. Since the value of `ah` is equivalent to `ac`, we can replace `ah` with `ac` in this statement.\n5.
