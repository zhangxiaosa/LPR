The target to be optimized is the infinite loop `for (;;)`.\n2. We can optimize out this loop by performing loop unrolling, which means unfolding the loop into individual iterations.\n3. Since the loop does not contain any statements, each iteration does not perform any meaningful computation.\n4. To optimize out the loop, we can remove it entirely and replace it with the statements within the loop body.\n5. The loop body consists of two statements: `struct h r;` and `p = r = p;`.\n6. After unrolling the loop, we need to determine the desired number of iterations.\n   - Without any additional context or requirements, it is not clear how many iterations are desired.\n   - As an example, let's assume that we want to unroll the loop 3 times.\n7. Unrolling the loop 3 times results in the following program:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\nstruct h {\n  int i;\n  long j;\n  unsigned k;\n};\n\nstatic struct h fn1(struct h p5) {\n  unsigned p5_k = p5.k;\n\nw:\n  goto w;\n}\n\nint fn2() {\n  struct h p;\n  fn1(p);\n\n  struct h r1;\n  p = r1 = p;\n\n  struct h r2;\n  p = r2 = p;\n\n  struct h r3;\n  p = r3 = p;\n  \n  return 0;\n}\n\nint main() {\n  fn2();\n  return 0;\n}\n```\n\n8.
