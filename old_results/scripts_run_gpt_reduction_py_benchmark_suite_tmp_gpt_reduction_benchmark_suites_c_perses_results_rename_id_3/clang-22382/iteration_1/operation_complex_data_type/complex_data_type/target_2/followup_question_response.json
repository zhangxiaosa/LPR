The function `fn1` is called with the `p` variable as an argument. Then, a `for` loop with no condition is defined, which means it will run indefinitely. Inside that loop, a local variable `r` of type `struct h` is declared, and both `p` and `r` are assigned the value of `p` in succession.\n4. The `main` function is defined as an integer function that returns an `int` and takes no arguments.
