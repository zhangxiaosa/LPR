Start by analyzing the program to determine where the variable `r` is used.\n\n2. The variable `r` is referenced in the `fn7` function within the condition `if (!r)`.\n\n3. To optimize out `r`, we need to analyze the condition and determine its constant value.\n\n4. Since `r` is defined as `static int r = 0x2A52L`, its value is constant and known at compile-time.\n\n5. The constant value of `r` is `0x2A52`, which is nonzero.\n\n6. As the condition of the `if` statement `if (!r)` is checking if `r` is equal to zero, it evaluates to false and the `else` block is executed.\n\n7. Inside the `else` block, the `printf` statement references `r` as an argument. Since the condition `if (!r)` is always false, this `printf` statement is never executed.\n\n8.

The value returned is then compared to `0` in the `if` condition.\n\n6. If `r` is `0`, a formatted string is printed, which includes the call to `fn3(p1, 0xBC2AB98C)`. This means that `r` is used inside the formatted string.\n\nConsidering the above analysis, we can optimize out the variable `r` by performing constant propagation on its use within the formatted string in the `if` condition.

Inside the `fn7` function, the `fn3` function is called with the parameters `p1` and `p`. The value of `p` is the global variable `r`. Since `r` is declared as `static` and assigned a constant value, its value can be determined at compile-time and can be propagated to the call site.\n\n4. The result of the `fn3` function call is then used in various conditions and assignments, but none of them affect the value of `r`.\n\n5. The function `fn8` is called from `main`, and it contains the conditional statement `if (fn7(1))`, which calls `fn7` with the constant value `1`. As mentioned earlier, the value of `r` can be propagated to the `fn3` call inside `fn7`.\n\n6.
