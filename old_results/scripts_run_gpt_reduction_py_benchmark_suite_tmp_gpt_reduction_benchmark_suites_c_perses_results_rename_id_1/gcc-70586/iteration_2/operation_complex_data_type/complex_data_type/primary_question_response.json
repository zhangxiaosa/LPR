The program starts with the function signature `int fn3(int p1, int p2)` which takes two integer parameters and returns an integer.\n\n2. The function `fn3` has two integer parameters, `p1` and `p2`.\n\n3. The function `fn3` returns an expression `p2 == 0 || p1 && p2 ? p1 : p1 % p2`, which is an integer.\n\n4. The global variables `int p`, `static int r`, `unsigned s`, and the 2D array `unsigned t[7][1]` have primitive data types and are not considered as complex data types.\n\n5. The function `fn7` has a short integer parameter `p1`.\n\n6. Inside the `fn7` function, there is a local unsigned integer variable `af` which is not a complex data type.\n\n7. The function `fn7` calls the `fn3` function passing `p1` and `0xBC2AB98C` as arguments.\n\n8. The function `fn7` contains some complex expressions but does not have any variables with complex data types.\n\n9.
