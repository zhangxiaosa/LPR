Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. The function `fn3` has two parameters, both of type `int`. These data types are not redundant.\n2. The variable `p` is of type `int`. This data type is not redundant.\n3. The variable `r` is of type `int` and is declared as `static`. This data type is not redundant.\n4. The variable `s` is of type `unsigned`. This data type is not redundant.\n5. The variable `t` is a 2D array of type `unsigned`. This data type is not redundant.\n6. The function `fn7` has one parameter of type `short` and returns an `int`. These data types are not redundant.\n7. Inside the function `fn7`, there is a local variable `af` of type `unsigned`. This data type is not redundant.\n8. The function `printf` is called with a format specifier `%lld`, which expects a `long long` argument. Casting the result of `fn3` to `long long` ensures the correct data type. This data type is not redundant.\n9. The variable `p` inside the `fn8` function is already declared as a global variable.
