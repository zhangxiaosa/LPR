The program defines a function named `fn3` that takes two integer parameters `p1` and `p2`. The function returns an integer.\n   - Variable(s) with complex data type: None\n\n2. Inside the `fn3` function, there are multiple conditional statements.\n   - Variable(s) with complex data type: None\n\n3. Outside the `fn3` function, the program declares an unsigned integer variable named `m` and an integer variable named `o`.\n   - Variable(s) with complex data type: None\n\n4. The program defines the `main` function.\n   - Variable(s) with complex data type: None\n\n5. Inside the `main` function, a variable `loopCount` is declared and assigned the value of `m` which is an unsigned integer.\n   - Variable(s) with complex data type: None\n\n6.

The program starts with a function definition: `int fn3(int p1, int p2)`.\n   - The function `fn3` takes two parameters `p1` and `p2`, both of type `int`.\n\n2. Inside the function `fn3`, there are multiple conditional statements:\n   a. `if (p1 && p2 && p1 > 2147483647 - p2)`\n      - This condition checks if `p1`, `p2`, and the result of `p1 > 2147483647 - p2` are all non-zero. It compares the sum of `p1` and `p2` with the maximum value of `int`.\n      - No complex data types exist in this condition.\n\n   b. `else if (p1 < 0 && p2 < 0 && p1)`\n      - This condition checks if both `p1` and `p2` are negative and `p1` is non-zero.\n      - No complex data types exist in this condition.\n\n   c. `else`\n      - This is the default condition that executes if the previous conditions are not met.\n      - No complex data types exist in this condition.\n\n   d.

After the function definition of `fn3`, two global variables are declared:\n   - `unsigned m;` - An unsigned integer variable `m`.\n   - `int o;` - An integer variable `o`.\n\n4. The program continues with the `main` function definition: `int main()`.\n   - Inside the `main` function, a local variable is declared: `unsigned loopCount = m;`.\n     - The variable `loopCount` is an unsigned integer initialized with the value of the global variable `m`.\n\n5. A `for` loop starts with the condition `loopCount < 12`.\n   - Inside the `for` loop, `loopCount` is updated using the function `fn3` as `loopCount = fn3(loopCount, 3)`.\n     - The return value of `fn3` is assigned to `loopCount`.\n     - `fn3` modifies `loopCount` each time it is called.\n\n6. Inside the `for` loop, another local variable is declared: `int temp = o == 0 ? o : o % o;`.\n   - The variable `temp` is an integer.\n   - The expression `o == 0 ? o : o % o` calculates the remainder of dividing `o` by itself, unless `o` is zero, then `temp` will be assigned the value of `o`.\n\n7. Inside the `for` loop, there are two conditional statements:\n   a. `if (o <= 0xE3L)`\n      - This condition checks if `o` is less than or equal to the hexadecimal value `0xE3L` (which is equivalent to 227 in decimal).\n      - No complex data types exist in this condition.\n\n   b. `else if (temp)`\n      - This condition checks if `temp` is non-zero, i.e., `temp` contains a non-zero value.\n      - No complex data types exist in this condition.\n\n8.
