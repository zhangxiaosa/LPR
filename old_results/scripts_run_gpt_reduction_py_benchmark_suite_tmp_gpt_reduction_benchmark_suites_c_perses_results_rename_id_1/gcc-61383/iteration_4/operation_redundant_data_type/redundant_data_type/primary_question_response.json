The program starts with the definition of a function `fn3`. The parameters `p1` and `p2` are both of type `int`. No redundant data types are present in this function.\n\n2. The function `main` is defined, returning an `int`. It declares the variables `loopCount`, `temp`, and `m`, all with explicit data types.\n\n3. Within the `for` loop, the variable `loopCount` is assigned the value returned by the `fn3` function, which takes two `int` parameters and returns an `int`. No redundant data types are present here.\n\n4. Inside the `for` loop, the variable `temp` is declared as an `int`. Again, no redundant data types are used.\n\n5. The `if` statement checks the condition `o <= 0xE3L`, but no redundant data types are present in this expression.\n\n6. The second `if` statement checks the condition `temp`, which is already declared as `int` and not a redundant data type.\n\n7.
