Since `p2` is a constant, we can compute the results of those function calls and replace the expressions with the constant values.\n9. In the main function, we see that `f = v`.

Propagate `p2` in function `fn2`: Since `p2` is used as an operand for the `%` operator, we need to ensure that its value is not zero before performing this operation. We can replace `p2` with its value in the condition `p1 && p2`. If `p2` is zero, the condition will evaluate to `false`, and if `p2` is non-zero, the condition will evaluate to `p1`. The updated code for `fn2` is:\n\n   ```c\n   short fn2(short p1, short p2) {\n     return p1 && (p2 != 0) ? p1 : p1 % p2;\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. Propagate `p2` in function `fn6`: Since `p2` is not used within the function body, we can simply optimize it out and remove the function parameter.

Propagate `p2` in function `fn7`: Similar to `fn6`, `p2` is not used within the function body, so we can remove it from the parameter list and optimize it out. The updated code for `fn7` is:\n\n   ```c\n   unsigned fn7(unsigned p1) {\n     return p1;\n   }\n   ```\n\n4.

Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. In `fn2(short p1, short p2)`, we see that `p2` is used in the condition `p1 && p2`. However, since `p2` is being used in a logical operation, we cannot optimize it out.\n\n2. In `fn3(long p1, long p2)`, the variable `p2` is returned directly. As a result, we can optimize it out by replacing every occurrence of `p2` in the function body with its initial value.\n\n3. In `fn5(char p1, int p2)` and `fn6(unsigned p1, unsigned p2)`, `p2` is returned directly, so we can optimize it out similarly to `fn3`.\n\n4. In `fn7(unsigned p1, unsigned p2)`, the variable `p2` is returned directly, so we can optimize it out.\n\n5. In `fn8(long p1, long long p2)`, `p2` is used in the addition `p1 + p2`. The addition prevents us from optimizing `p2` out.\n\n6. In `fn12()`, we have multiple function calls that use `p2`. However, due to the complexity of the expressions and the presence of function calls, we cannot perform constant propagation or copy propagation.\n\n7. In `main()`, the function `fn12()` is called and its return value is assigned to `f`. While `f` is not directly related to `p2`, we need to keep it in the optimized code.\n\nBased on the analysis, we can optimize out `p2` in `fn3()`, `fn5()`, `fn6()`, `fn7()`.
