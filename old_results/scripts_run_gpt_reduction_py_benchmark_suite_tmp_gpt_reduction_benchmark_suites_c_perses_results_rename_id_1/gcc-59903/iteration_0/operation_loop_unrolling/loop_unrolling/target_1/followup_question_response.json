For simplicity, let's set `unroll_factor` to 2.\n\n3.

Determine the number of loop iterations (`n`) for loop unrolling. Since the loop condition is based on the variable `w`, we need to analyze the surrounding code to determine the appropriate number of iterations. In this case, the code snippet provided doesn't include enough context to determine the exact value of `w` or how it's modified before and after the loop.

Replace the original loop `for (; w; w += 1)` with the unrolled loop headers:\n\n   ```c++\n   for (; w; w += 2) {\n     // Unrolled loop body\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. Duplicate the loop body `n` times within the unrolled loop. Update the loop control variables as necessary to reflect the unrolling.

Apply any necessary adjustments to variables used within the loop body due to the duplication.
