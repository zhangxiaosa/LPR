In this case, the target loop is `for (; w; w += 1)`. \n\nSince the loop is a simple counter-loop where `w` is incremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches zero, we can unroll the loop by replacing it with equivalent code without the loop construct. Unrolling the loop means manually duplicating the loop body for a certain number of times (in this case, until `w` reaches zero), eliminating the need for the loop control.\n\nHere's the step-by-step optimization process using loop unrolling:\n\n1. Replace the target loop with an unrolled version:\n```c\n// Before optimization\nfor (; w; w += 1) {\n  // Loop body\n}\n\n// After optimization (unrolled version)\nif (w >= 1) {\n  // Loop body\n}\nif (w >= 2) {\n  // Loop body\n}\nif (w >= 3) {\n  // Loop body\n}\n// Repeat the above if statement block until w reaches zero\n```\n\n2. The loop condition `w` represents the number of iterations in the original loop. We need to manually repeat the loop body a number of times based on the value of `w`.\n\n3. In each repeated if statement block, insert the loop body of the original loop. The loop body may contain assignments, function calls, or any other statements.\n\n4. The loop variable `w` is incremented by 1 in each iteration. Instead of the increment, we can use the value of `w` in the if statement check to determine if the loop body should be executed.\n\n5.

The target loop is `for (; w; w += 1)`. It starts with an empty initialization, continues as long as `w` is non-zero, and increments `w` by 1 in each iteration.\n\n2. Loop unrolling is a technique that involves duplicating loop iterations to reduce loop overhead and increase performance. In this case, we can unroll the loop by multiple iterations at a time.\n\n3. Let's unroll the loop by four iterations. This means we will perform four iterations of the loop body in each iteration of the unrolled loop.\n\n4. Update the loop statement to `for (; w >= 4; w -= 4)` to account for the unrolled iterations. This condition ensures that the remaining iterations after unrolling are a multiple of 4. \n\n5. Modify the loop body to execute the original loop body four times consecutively:\n\n```plaintext\nn[0] = v;\nn[0] = v;\nn[0] = v;\nn[0] = v;\n```\n\n6.
