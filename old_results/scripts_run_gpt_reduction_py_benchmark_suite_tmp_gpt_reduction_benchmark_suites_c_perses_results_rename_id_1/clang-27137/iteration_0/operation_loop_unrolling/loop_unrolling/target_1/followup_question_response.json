Determine the number of iterations needed to reach or fall below `s`:\n   - Since the loop condition is `r > s`, and `r` is decremented by 1 in each iteration, `r` needs to be greater than `s` by at least `1` after each iteration.\n   - Therefore, the number of iterations needed is `r - s`.\n\n2.

Loop unrolling reduces loop overhead by executing multiple iterations within each loop iteration.\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis of how we can optimize the given program:\n\n1. First, let's analyze the purpose of the loop. The loop `while (r > s)` is decrementing the value of `r` by 1 repeatedly until `r` becomes less than or equal to `s`.\n\n2. We need to determine the number of iterations needed to complete the above condition. In this case, since `r` is initialized with the value of `o`, and `s` is initialized with the value `1L`, we need to decrement `r` by 1 until it becomes less than or equal to 1.\n\n3. To optimize the loop, we can unroll it by replicating the loop body multiple times. Since the number of iterations required to reach the condition `r <= s` is known (in this case, 1 iteration), we can unroll the loop by manually replicating the loop body once.\n\n4. The optimized version will remove the loop entirely and execute the loop body code once. We will also update the loop variables and remove the loop condition.\n\n5.

In the given program, the loop is intended to decrement the value of `r` until it becomes less than or equal to `s`. Let's break down the optimization process step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the loop**: The loop condition `while (r > s)` ensures that `r` keeps decrementing until it reaches a value less than or equal to `s`.\n\n2. **Determining the loop count**: In the given program, the loop count is fixed at 10 based on the loop initialization `for (i = 0; i < 10; i++)`. This means the loop will iterate exactly 10 times.\n\n3. **Loop unrolling**: Loop unrolling is a technique where multiple loop iterations are combined into a single iteration. In this case, we will unroll the loop by a factor of 10, as the loop count is fixed at 10.\n\n4. **Applying loop unrolling**: We can unroll the loop by replacing the loop with 10 iterations of the loop body. Since the loop body only contains a single statement `r -= 1;`, we can repeat this statement 10 times without any changes.\n\nThe optimized program with loop unrolling would look like this:\n\n```c\ntypedef char a;\ntypedef short b;\ntypedef int c;\ntypedef unsigned d;\n\nvoid fn1(d p1, int p2) {\n  printf(\"checksum = %X\\n\", p1);\n}\n\nb o;\na p;\n\nint main() {\n  int i;\n  b r = o;\n  c s = 1L;\n\n  for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n    r -= 1;\n    r -= 1;\n    r -= 1;\n    r -= 1;\n    r -= 1;\n    r -= 1;\n    r -= 1;\n    r -= 1;\n    r -= 1;\n    r -= 1;\n  }\n  \n  if (p = r)\n    ;\n  \n  fn1(p, 0);\n  \n  return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThe `while (r > s)` loop has been replaced with 10 iterations of `r -= 1;` statements.

Determine the loop bounds: The loop condition is `r > s`, and the loop variable is `i`. The loop bounds are `i = 0` to `i < 10`.\n\n2. Calculate the number of loop iterations: Since the loop condition is not dependent on `i`, the loop will execute the same number of times for each iteration. In this case, the loop will execute 10 times.\n\n3. Unroll the loop: To unroll the loop, we manually repeat the loop body 10 times. Since the loop body only contains the statement `r -= 1;`, we can simply replace the loop with `r -= 10;` to achieve the same effect.\n\n4. Remove the loop related code: After unrolling the loop, we no longer need the loop variable `i` and the loop bounds. We can remove the entire loop-related code.\n\n5. Check the condition `p = r`: In the original code, the condition `p = r` is used in an `if` statement. It assigns the value of `r` to `p` and checks if the resulting value is non-zero. Since there are no subsequent statements or actions based on the condition, the assignment statement `p = r;` becomes redundant and can be removed.\n\n6.
