Replace the complex data type `char` with its corresponding primary data type `int` in the function `fn2`. The modified function will be:\n\n```c\nint fn2(int p1, int p2_int) {\n    return p1;\n}\n```\n\n2. Replace the complex data type `short` with its corresponding primary data type `int` in the function `fn11`. The modified function will be:\n\n```c\nint fn11() {\n    int d_ = 2;\n    for (; u < 51; ++u) {\n        v0_3 = d_;\n        d_ = fn2(v0_3, 3) + 0x9EE7F9D1C772505B;\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n3.

The target variable to be optimized is `v0_3`. Here's the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. The program defines a function `fn2` that takes two parameters `p1` of type `char` and `p2_int` of type `int`. The function returns a value of type `char`.\n2. The program declares several variables: `u` of type `int`, `v0_0`, `v0_1`, `v0_2`, and `v0_3` of type `short`. These variables are of primary data types.\n3. The program defines a function `fn11` that returns a value of type `short`.\n4. Inside `fn11`, a local variable `d_` of type `short` is declared and initialized to 2.\n5. The `for` loop initializes `u` to a value and iterates as long as `u` is less than 51. In each iteration, `v0_3` is assigned the value of `d_`, and then `d_` is updated using the `fn2` function and some constant.\n6. The `fn11` function returns 0.\n7. The `main` function is defined, which returns an integer.\n8. In `main`, `fn11` is called.\n9. After `fn11` is called, the value of `v0_3` is printed using `printf`.\n\nTo optimize the target variable `v0_3`, we need to understand its usage and context within the program. It seems that `v0_3` is modified within the `for` loop of the `fn11` function. The final value of `v0_3` is then printed in the `main` function.\n\nTo decompose the program into variables with primary data types, we can replace the complex data type `short` with a primary data type.
