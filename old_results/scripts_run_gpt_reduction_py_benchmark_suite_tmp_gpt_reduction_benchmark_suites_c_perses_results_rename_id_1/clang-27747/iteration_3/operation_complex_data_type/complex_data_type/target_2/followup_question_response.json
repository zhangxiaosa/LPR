Two variables of type `struct c` are declared: `i` and `j`.\n\n3. The `main()` function begins.\n\n4. Inside the `main()` function:\n   - A new variable `l` of type `struct c` is declared and initialized with the values `{24, 6738, 165}`.\n   - The value of `j.e` is assigned to `l.d`.\n   - A new variable `n` of type `int` is declared and assigned the logical AND of `j.h` and `l.d`.\n   - The value `- (l.f && l.d)` is computed and subtracted from `n`. The result is then assigned to `i.g`.\n\n5. The main function ends.\n\nTo optimize the variable `l`, we need to analyze its usage in the program and evaluate whether it can be simplified or optimized further.
