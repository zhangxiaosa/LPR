The program starts with the include statement `#include <stdio.h>`. It includes the standard input/output library.\n\n2. The program defines a structure `h` with three members: `i` of type `signed int`, `j` of type `long int`, and `k` of type `unsigned int`.\n\n3. The program declares a global variable `l` of type `unsigned int`.\n\n4. The program defines a static function `fn1`. It takes the following parameters:\n   - `p1` of type `unsigned int`\n   - `p2` of type `short int`\n   - `p3` of type `unsigned int`\n   - `p4` of type `unsigned int`\n   - `p5` of type `struct h`\n\n   Inside the function, there is a statement `p5.k`, which accesses the member `k` of the structure `p5`. However, it is not assigned to any variable or used in any way.\n\n   There is also an infinite loop using the `goto` statement `w:` and `goto w;`.\n\n5.
