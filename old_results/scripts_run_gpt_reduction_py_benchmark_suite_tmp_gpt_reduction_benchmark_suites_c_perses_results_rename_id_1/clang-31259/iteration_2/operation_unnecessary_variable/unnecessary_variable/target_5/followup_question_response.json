The target variable to be optimized is `u`.\n2. `u` is only used in the expression `fn4(fn2(1, fn2(3, u--)), 4294967295)` within the `optimized_fn9` function. It is decremented by 1 (`u--`) in this expression.\n3. Since `u` is not used anywhere else in the program, constant propagation can be applied by replacing `u` with its current value at the time of usage.\n4. To perform constant propagation, we need to determine the current value of `u` at the usage point.\n5. The initial value of `u` is not provided in the program.\n6. Assuming `u` is initialized to a constant value, say `initial_u`, we can propagate it as follows:\n   - Replace `u--` with `initial_u--`.\n   - Replace `fn4(fn2(1, fn2(3, u--)), 4294967295)` with `fn4(fn2(1, fn2(3, initial_u--)), 4294967295)`.\n7.
