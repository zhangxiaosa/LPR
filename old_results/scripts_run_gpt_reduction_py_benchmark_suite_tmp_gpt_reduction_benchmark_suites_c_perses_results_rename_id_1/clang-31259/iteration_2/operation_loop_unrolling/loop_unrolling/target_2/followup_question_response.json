The target loop is `for (j = 0; j < 2; j++)`.\n\n2. To optimize it with loop unrolling, we need to determine the number of iterations in the original loop and unroll it by that factor.\n\n3. The loop iterates for `j` values from 0 to 1, so it has a total of 2 iterations.\n\n4. We will unroll the loop by a factor of 2. This means we will repeat the loop body twice.\n\n5. After unrolling, the loop will look like:\n\n   ```cpp\n   // First iteration\n   j = 0;\n   ai[j] = 8;\n   j++;  // Increment j for the next iteration\n   // Second iteration\n   j = 1;\n   ai[j] = 8;\n   j++;  // Increment j for the next iteration\n   ```\n\n6.
