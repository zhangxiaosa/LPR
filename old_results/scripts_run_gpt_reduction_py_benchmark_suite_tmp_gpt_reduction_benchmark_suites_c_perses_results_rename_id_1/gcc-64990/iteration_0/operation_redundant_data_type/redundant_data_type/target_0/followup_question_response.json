The program begins with typedef statements. We need to substitute every instance of typedef signed a with its associated original data type, which is `signed int`. So, the first typedef statement can be replaced with `typedef signed int a;`.\n\n2. The second typedef statement defines the type `short` as `b`. Since `b` is the target to be optimized (and `short` is the associated original data type), we can eliminate this statement.\n\n3. The third typedef statement defines the type `int` as `c`. We can eliminate this statement because `c` is not the target to be optimized.\n\n4. The fourth typedef statement defines the type `unsigned` as `d`. We can eliminate this statement because `d` is not the target to be optimized.\n\n5. The fifth typedef statement defines the type `short` as `e`. We can eliminate this statement because `e` is not the target to be optimized.\n\n6. The sixth typedef statement defines the type `unsigned` as `f`. We can eliminate this statement because `f` is not the target to be optimized.\n\n7. The seventh line declares a static variable `g` of type `b`. Since `b` is the target to be optimized (and `short` is the associated original data type), we can eliminate the type declaration and change the variable declaration to `static short g = 0x7EBAL;`.\n\n8.

We can eliminate the type declaration and change the variable declaration to `unsigned k = 0xAF7C65D6L;`.\n\n12. The twelfth line declares a static variable `l` of type `d`. We can eliminate the type declaration and change the variable declaration to `unsigned l;`.\n\n13. The thirteenth line declares a 3D array `m` of type `f`. We can eliminate the type declaration and change the variable declaration to `unsigned m[9][2][3];` since `f` is equivalent to `unsigned`.\n\n14. The fourteenth line declares a variable `n` of type `c`. We can eliminate the type declaration and change the variable declaration to `int n;` since `c` is equivalent to `int`.\n\n15.

We need to substitute the parameter types and return type with their associated original data types. The function definition becomes `signed int fn1(signed int p1, short p2, int p3, signed int p4)`. The variable `p1` used within the function should also be changed to its associated type `signed int`.\n\n16. The sixteenth line defines the function `fn2`, which takes parameter `c` and returns `a`. We need to substitute the parameter type and return type with their associated original data types. The function definition becomes `signed int fn2(int p1)`. The variable `w` used within the function should also be changed to its associated type `int`.\n\n17. The eighteenth line defines the function `fn3`, which returns `f`.
