The program begins by declaring several variables including `g_new`, `h`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `m`, and `n`.\n2. `fn3()` is a function that calls `fn1()` with various arguments and returns the value of `n`.\n3. `fn1()` is a function that performs a logical OR operation on `p1` and assigns its value to `m[1][0][1]`. It then returns the constant value 2.\n4. `fn2()` is a function that performs several operations and returns either a value from `v[g_new][0][0]` or `j[g_new][g_new]` based on certain conditions.\n5. The `main()` function calls `fn3()`.\n\nTo optimize out the variable `n`, we can perform constant propagation by replacing all instances of `n` with the constant value it holds.

The function `fn3` calls `fn1` and passes `n` as an argument. However, since `n` is not modified or used within `fn1`, this call is ineffective and can be removed.\n3.

Since `n` is not modified or used anywhere else in the program, its value can be propagated and replaced with a constant value to optimize it out.\n4.
