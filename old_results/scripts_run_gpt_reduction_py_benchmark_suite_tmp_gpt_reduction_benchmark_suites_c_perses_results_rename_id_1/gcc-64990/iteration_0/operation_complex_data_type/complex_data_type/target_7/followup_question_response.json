We have the following variables with complex data types:\n   - `d h` (unsigned)\n   - `short i`\n   - `int j[5][5]`\n   - `unsigned k`\n   - `d l` (unsigned)\n   - `unsigned m[9][2][3]`\n   - `c n` (int)\n\n2. We can decompose these complex data types into variables with primary data types:\n   - For `d h`, we can keep it as it is since it is already of type `unsigned`.\n   - For `short i`, we keep it as it is since it is already of type `short`.\n   - For `int j[5][5]`, we can keep it as it is since it is already of type `int`.\n   - For `unsigned k`, we keep it as it is since it is already of type `unsigned`.\n   - For `d l`, we can keep it as it is since it is already of type `unsigned`.\n   - For `unsigned m[9][2][3]`, we can keep it as it is since it is already of type `unsigned`.\n   - For `c n`, we can change it from `int` to `c` since it is declared as `typedef int c`.\n\n3. We can remove the `typedef` lines since we have decomposed the complex data types into primary data types.\n\n4. We can remove the initialization for `static short g_new` since it is not used in the program.\n\n5. We can modify the `fn1` function to remove the condition `p1 || (m[1][0][1] = p1)`, as it does not affect the value of `n`.\n\n6. We can remove the second argument `short p2` from the `fn1` function since it is not used in the function.\n\n7. We can remove the `fn3` function since it only calls `fn1` and returns `n`.\n\n8. We can remove the `fn2` function since it is not used in the program.\n\n9.
