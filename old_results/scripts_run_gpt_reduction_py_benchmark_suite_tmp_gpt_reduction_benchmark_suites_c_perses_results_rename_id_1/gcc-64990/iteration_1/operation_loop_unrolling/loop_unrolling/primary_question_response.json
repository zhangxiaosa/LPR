The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than 6.\n   - The loop body contains an `if` statement followed by a `break` statement, which terminates the loop prematurely.\n   - The loop does not have an increment statement, implying that `i` should be modified within the loop body to avoid an infinite loop.\n\n2.
