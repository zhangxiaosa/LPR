It then returns the literal value `2`.\n12. The function `fn2` is defined, which declares a 3-dimensional int array `v` with dimensions 6x3x2. It then enters a loop that iterates as long as the value of the variable `i` is less than `6`. Inside the loop, it checks if the variable `k` is non-zero and breaks the loop if it is. Otherwise, it returns the value of `v[g_new][0][0]`. After the loop, it checks if the variable `h` is non-zero (which does nothing) and returns the value of `j[g_new][g_new]` if `h` is zero.
