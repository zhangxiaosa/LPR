Here's the step-by-step analysis and optimization:\n\n1. Analyzing the loop:\n   - The loop condition `j` determines the number of iterations.\n   - The loop body does not contain any statements, it is an empty loop.\n\n2. Unrolling the loop:\n   - Since the loop body does not contain any statements, we can directly optimize it by determining the number of iterations based on the initial value of `j`.\n   - We can replace the loop `for (; j; --j)` with equivalent code that performs the same operations.\n\n3. Optimization steps:\n   - Based on the initial value of `j` identified as `0x24F96B7B`, we can calculate the number of iterations using the following formula: `numIterations = j - 1`.\n   - We can then replace the loop with a sequence of `numIterations` decrements of `j` (i.e., `--j`) to achieve the same effect.\n\nWith these optimization steps, we can now modify the original code to include the loop unrolling.

Loop unrolling is a technique where we duplicate loop iterations to reduce the overhead of the loop control.

Determine the loop conditions:\n   - Loop initialization: None\n   - Loop condition: `j`\n   - Loop increment: `--j`\n\n2. Identify the loop body: None\n\n3. Decide the loop unrolling factor: `n`\n\n4.
