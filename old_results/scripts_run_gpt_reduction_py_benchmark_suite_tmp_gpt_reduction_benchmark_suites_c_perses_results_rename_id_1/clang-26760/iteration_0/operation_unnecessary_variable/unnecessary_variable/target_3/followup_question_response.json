The target variable to optimize is `n`.\n2. Given that `n` is initialized with the value of `g`, we need to find all the occurrences of `g` in the program and replace them with `n`.\n3. The only occurrence of `g` is in the assignment statement `a n = g;`. We can replace `g` with `n` to directly assign the value of `n` to `n`. This step is known as copy propagation.\n4. After performing the copy propagation, the program becomes:\n```c\ntypedef signed a;\ntypedef int c;\ntypedef unsigned d;\ntypedef unsigned e;\nd f;\na g;\nint main() {\n  a i;\n  c j = 0x24F96B7BL;\n  e k;\n  for (f = 0;)\n    for (; j; --j)\n      ;\n  c l = 1L;\n  c m = j;\n  a n = n;\n  c o = n;\n  e p = o;\n  while (p) {\n    k = k >> l;\n    i = p;\n    if (i)\n      k = k << m;\n  }\n}\n```\n5.
