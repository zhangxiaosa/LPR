In this case, we can unroll the loop four times since we know that the loop condition `u < 51` holds true for at least 4 iterations.\n\nHere's the step-by-step analysis of the loop unrolling optimization:\n\n1. Initialize `d` to 2L.\n2. Calculate `d` using `fn4` and `fn2` functions as follows:\n   - `d = fn4(fn2(v_0_3 = d, 3), 0x9EE7F9D1C772505BLL)`\n   - Assign `d` to `v_0_3`.\n   - Repeat this step four times, incrementing `u` by 1 after each iteration.\n3.

The target loop is `for (; u < 51; ++u)`.\n2. Loop unrolling is a technique used to optimize loops by executing multiple iterations per loop iteration.\n3. Since the loop does not have any body statements, we need to determine the number of iterations that can be executed per loop iteration.\n4. The loop condition is `u < 51`, so the loop will iterate until `u` is equal to or greater than 51.\n5. Let's assume we unroll the loop by a factor of 4, which means we execute 4 iterations per loop iteration.\n6. We can rewrite the loop as follows:\n```cpp\nfor (; u < 51; u += 4) {\n  d = fn4(fn2(v_0_3 = d, 3), 0x9EE7F9D1C772505BLL);\n  d = fn4(fn2(v_0_3 = d, 3), 0x9EE7F9D1C772505BLL);\n  d = fn4(fn2(v_0_3 = d, 3), 0x9EE7F9D1C772505BLL);\n  d = fn4(fn2(v_0_3 = d, 3), 0x9EE7F9D1C772505BLL);\n}\n```\n7.
