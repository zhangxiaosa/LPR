Loop unrolling is a technique used to optimize loops by reducing loop overhead and increasing instruction-level parallelism. It involves duplicating loop iterations, reducing the number of iterations, and eliminating loop control instructions.\n\nIn this case, the target loop is `for (; u < 51; ++u)`. Let's perform loop unrolling to optimize it out.\n\nStep-by-step analysis and modifications:\n1. First, let's determine the number of iterations in the loop. The loop condition is `u < 51`, which means it will loop as long as `u` is less than 51. The loop increment is `++u`, which increments the value of `u` by 1 in each iteration. Since the initial value of `u` is not provided, we'll assume it to be 0.\n2. To optimize the loop, we can unroll it with a factor of 4. This means we'll perform four iterations of the loop in each unrolled iteration.\n3.
