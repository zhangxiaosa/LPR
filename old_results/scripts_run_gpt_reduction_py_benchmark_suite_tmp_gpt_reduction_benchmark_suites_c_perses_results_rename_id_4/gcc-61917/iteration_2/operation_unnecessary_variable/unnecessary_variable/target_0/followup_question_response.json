Hence, the value of `m_2_5` remains constant throughout the execution.\n\nSince `m_2_5` is always true (`m_2_5` is non-zero), the expression `p1 || m_2_5` will always evaluate to true.

Since `m_2_5` is not assigned any value and is not used in any meaningful way, we can optimize it out by removing its declaration and references.\n\n4.
