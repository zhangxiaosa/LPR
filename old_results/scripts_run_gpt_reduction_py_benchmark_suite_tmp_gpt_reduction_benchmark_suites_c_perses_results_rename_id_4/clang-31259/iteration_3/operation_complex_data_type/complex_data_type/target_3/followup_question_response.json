Initialize `int` variables: `u`, `v`, `w`, `af`.\n   - `u` is initialized as `0`.\n   - `v` is initialized as `0`.\n   - `w` is initialized as `254`.\n   - `af` is not explicitly initialized.\n\n2. Initialize the 3D integer array `ad1` with primary data type variables.\n   - `ad1` is declared as `int ad1[][5][7]` and initialized with primary data type elements.\n   - The array is initialized with the following values:\n     - `ad1[0][0][0] = 8`\n     - `ad1[1][0][0] = 8`\n     - `ad1[2][0][0] = 8`\n     - `ad1[2][0][1] = 0x98` (decimal value: 152)\n\n3. Define the `fn3` function.\n   - `fn3` is defined as an `int` function with two `int` parameters `p1` and `p2`.\n   - The function returns the value `1`.\n\n4.
