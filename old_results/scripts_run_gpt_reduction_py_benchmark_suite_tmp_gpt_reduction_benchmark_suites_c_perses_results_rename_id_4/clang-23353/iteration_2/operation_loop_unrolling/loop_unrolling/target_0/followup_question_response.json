Determine the unroll count: Decide how many times we want to unroll the loop. Since the loop starts at `6` and ends at `-7`, the total number of iterations is `6 - (-7) + 1 = 14`. We can unroll the loop by a factor of `2` to reduce the number of iterations to `14 / 2 = 7`.\n\n2.

Here, we'll use `p1`, `p2`, `result`, and `fn1_result`:\n\n```json\n{ \"program\": \"char p1, p2, result, fn1_result;\" }\n```\n\n3. Unroll the loop: Rewrite the loop body by applying loop unrolling. In each iteration, call the `fn1` function and calculate the result for `p3` and `i`. Then, perform the bitwise XOR operation with `j_h`.
