The program defines a typedef `d` which represents a complex data type. It is a vector of `long` values.\n\n2. The program declares a function `fn2()` that returns a value of type `d`. Inside this function:\n\n   a. It declares a variable `c` of type `long` and initializes it with the value of `fn1`.\n   \n   b. It declares a variable `f` of type `d` and initializes it with the value of `c`.\n   \n   c. It returns the value of `f`.\n   \n3. The program defines a `main()` function which is empty.\n\nBased on the analysis, we can decompose the program into variables with primary data types as follows:\n\n```c\nlong fn1() {}\n\nlong fn2() {\n  long c = fn1();\n  long f = c;\n  return f;\n}\n\nint main() {}\n```\n\nThe modified program converts the complex data type `d` into a primary data type `long`. The function `fn1()` is assumed to have a return type of `long`, and the function call `fn1` is changed to `fn1()`. The variable `f` of type `d` is replaced with `long f`.
