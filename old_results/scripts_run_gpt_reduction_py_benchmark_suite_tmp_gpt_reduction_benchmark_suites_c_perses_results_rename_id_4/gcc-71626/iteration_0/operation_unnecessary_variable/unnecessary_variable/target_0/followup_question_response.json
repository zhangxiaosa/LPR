Identify the variable `c` within the function `fn2()`.\n2. Since `c` is initialized with the function `fn1`, we need to determine whether `fn1` can be replaced with a constant value.\n3. Check if `fn1()` is defined anywhere in the program. If it is defined and its return value is constant, we can replace `fn1` with that constant value.\n4. Since there is no definition of `fn1()`, we cannot determine its constant value at compile-time.\n5. Therefore, `c` cannot be optimized out through constant propagation.\n6. Check if `c` is used anywhere else in the program. If it is not used, it can be safely optimized out.\n7. In this case, `c` is not used outside of its initialization, so it can be optimized out through copy propagation.\n\nBased on the analysis, we can optimize out the variable `c` by removing it from the program.

Constant Propagation: If the value of `fn1` is constant or known at compile-time, we can replace the usage of `c` with the actual value. However, if `fn1` is not a compile-time constant, we cannot use constant propagation.\n2. Copy Propagation: If `fn1` can have side effects or the value can vary at runtime, we can replace the usage of `c` with `fn1` directly, eliminating the need for the intermediate variable.\n\nSince the provided program is incomplete and lacks the definition of `fn1`, it's impossible to determine whether `fn1` has a constant value or if it can be safely replaced by its value.
