The variable `p2` is passed as a parameter to the function `fn2`. Its value is used in the statement `w = fn1(n[0].l, 2) && p2.k`. We need to determine if the value of `p2` can be optimized out.\n\n2. In the statement `w = fn1(n[0].l, 2) && p2.k`, the right-hand side involves a constant `2`, and the left-hand side involves the variable `p2.k`. Since `p2` is a parameter and is not modified within the function `fn2`, we can propagate the value of `p2.k` (which is a field of the structure `p2`) with the constant `2`. Therefore, the statement can be simplified to `w = fn1(n[0].l, 2) && 2`.\n\n3.
