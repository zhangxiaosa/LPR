Define data and functions:\n   - `char fn1(unsigned p1, int p2)` function declaration\n   - `struct i` struct declaration with members: `signed j`, `signed k`, `int l`\n   - `unsigned m[4]` array declaration\n   - `struct i n[2]` array of `struct i` declaration\n   - `struct i fn2(int p1, struct i p2, unsigned p3, short p4)` function declaration\n   - `unsigned fn3(p1)` function declaration\n   - `int main()` function declaration\n\n2. Analyze `fn2` function:\n   - Declare `struct i v` and initialize it with `{0x15L, -5L}`\n   - Declare variables `w`, `a`\n   - Check if `p4` XOR `v.k` is non-zero. If true, do nothing. Otherwise, assign `n[1]` to `v`.\n   - Enter a nested loop with conditions `w`, `p3 <= 39`, `p2.j <= 2`\n     - Assign `v` to `n[0]`\n     - Assign `m[p2.j]` to `v.l`\n     - Declare `struct i struct_i`\n     - Check if `n[0].j` is zero.
