Starting with the `fn5` function:\n   - Since `fn5` is called inside the loop, we need to analyze the loop to determine if any constant propagation or copy propagation can be applied.\n   - Looking at the loop condition `af <= 49`, it is clear that `af` is incremented by `8` in each iteration. Thus, the loop will execute `50 / 8 = 6` times.\n   - On each iteration, `af` is passed as the first argument (`p1`) to `fn5`, and `8` is passed as the second argument (`p2`).\n   - We can replace the function call `fn5(af, 8)` with its result, which is `af + 8`. This can be done since the arguments are constants or have constant values within the loop.\n   - After applying the constant propagation, the loop condition becomes `af + 8 <= 49`.\n\n2. Applying constant propagation to the loop:\n   - The loop condition `af + 8 <= 49` simplifies to `af <= 41`.\n   - Now we know that the loop will execute `6` times, with `af` taking the following values: `0, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40` (incrementing by `8` each time).\n   - We can replace the loop with a sequence of statements, eliminating the loop entirely.\n\n3.
