Here is the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. In the `fn2` function, `ai` is assigned the value of `fn3(p1, o)`. We need to analyze the `fn3` function to determine if it has any constant inputs.\n2. In the `fn3` function, the value of `p2` is compared to 0 in the condition `p2 == 0`. If `p2` is constant and equal to 0, the condition will always be true. We can replace the condition with `true` and optimize out the conditional expression.\n3. If the condition from step 2 is not true, the value of `p1` is used in the ternary expression `p2 ? p1 : p1 % p2`. If `p1` is constant, we can replace the ternary expression with the constant value. Otherwise, we need to analyze the value of `p2` to see if it is constant.\n   a. If `p2` is constant and equal to 0, the result of the ternary expression will always be `p1`.

We need to analyze the usage of `ai` in these places.\n   a. In the condition `if (fn2(p1, ag[6][5][0] + p1 || p1 && fn4(ai = fn3(p1, 0xBC2AB98CL), 9)))`, the value of `ai` is assigned the result of `fn3(p1, 0xBC2AB98CL)`. We can replace `ai` with the actual result if `p1` is constant or analyze the value of the function call.\n      - If `p1` is constant, we can calculate the result of `fn3(p1, 0xBC2AB98CL)` and replace `ai` with the result.\n      - If `p1` is not constant, we need to analyze the value of `fn3(p1, 0xBC2AB98CL)` to see if it is constant.\n   b. In the `else` block, `ai` is used in the `printf` statement.
