Inside `fn7_original`, the variable `ag` is defined as a 3D array and initialized with a single element.\n3. The variable `ai` is declared and initialized by calling the `fn3` function with arguments `p1_arg` and `p`.\n4.

The variable `p1_arg` is assigned the result of an expression involving the `fn3` function and some bitwise operations.\n9. The variable `p` is assigned the value of `p1_arg`.\n10. The variable `ai` is assigned the result of calling the `fn3` function with arguments `0x7D765DB6L` and `p`.\n11.
