The program starts with the main function.\n2. After the main function, there is a function named \"fn3\" defined with the following signature: `int fn3(int p1, int p2)`.\n3. Next, there is a variable declaration `int p;`.\n4. Then, two unsigned variables \"r\" and \"s\" are declared and initialized with hexadecimal values.\n5. After that, there is a static function declaration \"fn7\" with the following signature: `static unsigned fn7(short p1)`.\n6. The \"fn7\" function is defined below the declaration, which includes several nested loops, variable declarations, and function calls.\n7. Inside the \"fn7\" function, there is a function call to \"fn3\" with the parameters \"p1\" and \"p\" in different places.\n8. The \"fn7\" function returns an unsigned integer value.\n9. Finally, the main function calls the \"fn7\" function with the parameter value 1 and an empty statement if the return value is true.\n\nIdentified functions (other than the main function): fn3, fn7\n\nThe identified functions in JSON format:\n```json\n{\n  \"target_list\": [\"fn3\", \"fn7\"]\n}\n```"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 498, "completion_tokens": 563, "total_tokens": 1061}, "system_fingerprint": null}
