In the function `fn2(int32_t p1, int32_t p2)`, the return statement `return p1 && p2 ? p1 : p1 % p2;` uses both `p1` and `p2`, so we cannot optimize `p1` out in this function.\n\n2. In the function `fn8(int32_t p1, int64_t p2)`, the return statement `return p1 + p2;` uses `p1`, but as `fn8` is not called in the program, we can optimize out `p1` completely from this function.\n\n3. In the main function, the call to `fn12()` can potentially use `p1`. Inside `fn12()`, the line `int32_t temp = fn8(~(fn2(ap32, 1) != 0), ak) && 0x57;` passes `ak` as `p1` argument to `fn8`. Since the value of `ak` is not known at compile-time, we cannot optimize `p1` out in this call.\n\nConsidering the above analysis, we can optimize `p1` out in `fn8()` but not in `fn2()` or the call to `fn8()` in `fn12()`.
