Constant propagation: Evaluate the constant expressions involved in the assignment of `au_0`.\n   - Constant folding in `fn2(ap, 1L)`: The condition `ap && 1L` is simplified since 1L is always true.\n   - Constant folding in `fn3(aj, ... != 0)`: The condition `aj % (p2 != 0)` can be simplified since `p2` is always 1L in this case. Therefore, `aj % 1L` is equal to 0L.\n   - Evaluate `~(0L != 0)` in `fn8`: The condition `0L != 0` is false, so `~false` is true.\n   - Evaluate `(true && 0x57L)` in `fn8`: The logical AND of true and any value `x` is equivalent to `x`. Therefore, `true && 0x57L` is equal to `0x57L`.\n   - Simplify `au_0 = 0x57L`.\n3. Copy propagation: Replace all occurrences of `au_0` with its assigned value.\n   - Replace `au_0` in `fn5` with `0x57L`.\n4.
