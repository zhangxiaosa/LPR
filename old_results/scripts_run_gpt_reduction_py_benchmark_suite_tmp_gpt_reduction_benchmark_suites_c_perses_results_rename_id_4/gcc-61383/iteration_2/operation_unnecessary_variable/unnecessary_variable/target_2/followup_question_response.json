Start by examining the main function where the variable `p2` is not used.\n2. Remove the parameter `int fn3(int p1, int p2)` from the function `fn3` since `p2` is not used.\n3. The simplified `fn3` function becomes `int fn3(int p1)`.\n4. Update the main function call `n = fn3(n, 3)` to `n = fn3(n)`.\n5. In the main function, the variable `ab` is assigned the value of `o == 0 ? o : o % o`. This expression simplifies to `ab = 0` since the remainder of any number divided by itself (`o % o`) will always be 0.\n6. Remove the statement `if (o <= 0xE3L) ;` as it has no effect on the program flow.\n7. Since `ab` is always assigned the value 0, the condition `else if (ab)` becomes `else if (0)` which can be optimized out.\n8. The updated main function becomes:\n\n```cpp\nunsigned n;\nsigned o;\nint main() {\n  for (; n < 12; n = fn3(n)) {\n    int ab = 0;\n    if (o > 0xE3L)\n      break;\n  }\n  return 0;\n}\n```\n\n9.

However, since `p2` is the target variable to be optimized and we don't have any constant value for it, we cannot perform constant propagation or copy propagation in this case.

This is an example of constant propagation.\n     - The condition `o <= 0xE3L` does not depend on `p2`, so no optimization can be performed here.\n     - The `break` statement will exit the loop if the condition `ab` is truthy. Since `ab` is always 0, the loop will never break. However, this optimization does not directly affect `p2`.\n\n3. After the `for` loop, the `main` function returns 0.
