The program consists of three functions: `fn3`, `fn6`, and `main`.\n2. Function `fn3` takes two `int` parameters `p1` and `p2` and returns an `int`.\n3. Function `fn6` does not take any parameters and returns an `int`.\n4. The `main` function does not take any parameters and also returns an `int`.\n5. Function `fn6` contains a loop and calls `fn3` in each iteration, using the variable `n` as the first argument and `3` as the second argument.\n6. The loop continues until the value of `n` is greater than or equal to `12`.\n7. Within the loop, there is an if-else ladder that performs certain operations based on the value of `o`.\n8.
