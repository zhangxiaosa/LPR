Remove the typedef declaration `typedef unsigned f;` since we want to eliminate the `f` data type.\n2. Replace every occurrence of `f` with `unsigned`.\n3. Update the function signature `unsigned fn2(p1)` to specify the data type of `p1` as `unsigned`.\n4. Update the function `fn1` and its parameters to use the original data types:\n   - Change `f` to `unsigned` in the function signature.\n   - Change `g` to `unsigned` in the function signature.\n   - Change `unsigned` to `unsigned` in the `fn1` function call inside `fn2`.\n   - Change `unsigned` to `unsigned` in the `fn1` function call inside `fn1` itself.\n5. Replace the `p5.k;` statement inside the `fn1` function with a placeholder statement `;` to preserve the structure of the program.\n6. Remove the empty `for` loop inside the `fn2` function since it doesn't contribute to the analysis and modification.\n7.
