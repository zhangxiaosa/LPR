Determine the loop termination condition: Since the loop condition is `while (1)`, the loop does not have a natural termination condition. It will continue indefinitely until otherwise explicitly exited.\n\n3. Decide on the loop unrolling factor: Loop unrolling involves executing multiple iterations of the loop in a single iteration. In this case, we can unroll the loop by a factor of 4.\n\n4. Modify the loop body: In each iteration of the unrolled loop, copy the loop body 4 times.\n\n```cpp\nwhile (1) {\n  // Loop body (unrolled by 4)\n  // Copy the loop body 4 times\n\n  // Loop body 1\n  // Original code within the loop\n\n  // Loop body 2\n  // Original code within the loop\n\n  // Loop body 3\n  // Original code within the loop\n\n  // Loop body 4\n  // Original code within the loop\n}\n```\n\n5.

To optimize out the loop via loop unrolling, we can replace it with a sequence of statements that achieve the same result without the need for a loop.\n4. Since the loop doesn't have any instruction, we can replace it with an empty loop (i.e., no statements).\n5.

The program defines a structure `struct h` with three members `i`, `j`, and `k`.\n\n2. The static function `fn1` takes an instance of `struct h` as a parameter and performs an unused operation `p5.k`. It then enters an infinite loop using `while (1) {}`.\n\n3. The function `fn2` declares a local variable `p` of type `struct h` and calls the `fn1` function passing `p` as a parameter. It then enters an infinite loop using `while (1) {}`.\n\n4. The `main` function is empty and does not contain any code.\n\n5. The target for optimization is the second `while (1)` loop in the `fn2` function.\n\nTo optimize out the targeted loop using loop unrolling, we can modify the `fn2` function as follows:\n\n```c\nunsigned fn2() {\n  struct h p;\n  fn1(p);\n  \n  while (1) {\n    struct h r1, r2, r3, r4;\n    p = r1 = p;\n    p = r2 = p;\n    p = r3 = p;\n    p = r4 = p;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn the modified version, the loop has been unrolled four times by replicating the statement `p = r = p;` four times.
