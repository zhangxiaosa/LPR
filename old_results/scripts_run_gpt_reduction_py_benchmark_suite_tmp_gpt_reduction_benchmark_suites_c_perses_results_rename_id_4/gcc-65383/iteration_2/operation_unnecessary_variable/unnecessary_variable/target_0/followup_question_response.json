Let's go through the steps:\n\n1. Initialize the variable `h_2` with the hexadecimal value `0x92A1D2CDL`.\n2. Define the function `fn2`.\n3. Inside the `fn2` function, there is an infinite loop with a nested 3D array `r[5][9][5]`.\n4. Check the value of `h_2` using an `if` statement. If the condition is true (non-zero), return the hexadecimal value `0xC3L`.\n5. If the condition is false (zero), assign the value of an element from the array `r` to the global variable `g`. The element is accessed using three indices: `r[0x06D7L][0x06D7L][0x06D7L]`.\n6. The `main` function calls `fn2`.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can determine that `h_2` is only used in the condition statement of the `if` statement. Since the constant value of `h_2` is `0x92A1D2CDL`, which is non-zero, the `if` condition will always be true. Therefore, the variable `h_2` is unused and can be optimized out.\n\nHere is the optimized program with `h_2` removed:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"program\": \"int g;\\n\\nint fn2() {\\n  for (;;) {\\n    int r[5][9][5];\\n    return 0xC3L;\\n    g = r[0x06D7L][0x06D7L][0x06D7L];\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nint main() { fn2(); }\\n\"\n}\n```\n\nNote: The provided program is written in C/C++, so the optimized program is also in C/C++ syntax.
