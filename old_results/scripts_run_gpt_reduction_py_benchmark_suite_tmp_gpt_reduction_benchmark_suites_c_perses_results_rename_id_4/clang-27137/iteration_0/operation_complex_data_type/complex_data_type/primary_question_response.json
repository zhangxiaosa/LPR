The program declares the following variables:\n   - `unsigned h`\n   - `short o`\n   - `char p`\n   These variables have complex data types.\n\n2. The program then defines the `main` function.\n\n3.

Note that a single equals sign (`=`) is used for assignment, which is likely a mistake, and the condition will always evaluate to `true`. The fix would be to use double equals (`==`) for comparison.\n\n7. The variable `h` is assigned the value of `p`.\n\n8. Finally, the program prints the value of `h` as a hexadecimal number using the `printf` function.\n\nBased on this analysis, the identified variables with complex data types are: `h`, `o`, and `p`.
