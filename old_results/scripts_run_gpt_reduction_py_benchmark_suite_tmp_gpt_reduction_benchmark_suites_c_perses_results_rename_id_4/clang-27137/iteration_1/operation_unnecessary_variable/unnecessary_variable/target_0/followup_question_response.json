Declare the variable `loop_var` of type `int`.\n2. Declare the `main` function returning an `int`.\n3. Declare the variable `q` of type `int`.\n4. Assign the value of `loop_var` to `q`.\n5. Enter a `for` loop that initializes `loop_var` to 0, continues as long as `loop_var` is less than 10, and increments `loop_var` after each iteration.\n6. Enter a `while` loop that continues as long as `q` is greater than 1.\n7. Decrement `q` by 1.\n8. Exit the inner `while` loop.\n9. Exit the outer `for` loop.\n10.

Return 0 to indicate successful program execution.\n\nBased on this analysis, it appears that the variable `loop_var` is used to control the `for` loop, but its value is not used anywhere else in the program.
