Identify the specified data type that needs to be eliminated. In this case, the specified data type is \"signed.\"\n\n2. Replace every instance of the specified data type with its associated original data type, which is \"int\" in this case.\n\n3. Update the function signature and variable declaration accordingly. For example, change the function `signed fn1(unsigned p1, int p2)` to `int fn1(unsigned p1, int p2)`.\n\n4. Check for any uses of the specified data type as bit fields. In the given program, there is a structure \"m\" with two bit fields of type \"signed.\" Since the original data type is also \"signed,\" no changes are required in this case.\n\n5. Update any variable assignments or expressions involving the specified data type. For example, change `signed s = -5L;` to `int s = -5L;`.\n\n6. Update any usage of the specified data type within expressions or statements. For example, change `signed ae;` to `int ae;`.\n\n7. Update any usage of the specified data type in arithmetic or logical operations. For example, change `r = af % (~s / ae);` to `r = af % (~s / ae);`.\n\n8.
