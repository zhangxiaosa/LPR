The program consists of three functions: `fn2`, `fn3`, and `fn7`, along with the `main` function.\n2.

The function `fn7` receives a parameter `p1` of type `short` and returns an `unsigned` value. It also has local variables:\n   - `ac` (int)\n   - `ad` (int)\n   - `ae` (short)\n   - `af` (unsigned)\n   - `ag` (int 3D array)\n   - `ah` (unsigned)\n   - `ai` (unsigned)\n4. The `main` function calls `fn7` with the argument `1`, and if the return value is non-zero, an empty statement is executed.\n\nTo decompose the program into variables with primary data types, we need to analyze each complex data type and determine their primary counterparts.
