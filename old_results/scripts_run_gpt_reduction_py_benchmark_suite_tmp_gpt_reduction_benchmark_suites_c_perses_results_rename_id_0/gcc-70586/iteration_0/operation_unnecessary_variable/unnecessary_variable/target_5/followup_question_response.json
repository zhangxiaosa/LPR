Since `p1` is passed as an argument to the `fn7` function and is not modified within the function, its value is constant. Therefore, we can replace all occurrences of `p1` with its constant value.\n\nThe variable `o` is a global variable and its value is not modified within the current program.

Since the condition `!r` is not directly related to the value of `ah`, we can ignore it for constant propagation.\n3. Looking at the assignment `ah = ai`, we can see that `ah` will always be equal to `ai`.\n4. The value of `ai` is determined by the statement `unsigned ai = ac`.\n5. We need to find the assignments to the variable `ac` to determine if its value can be propagated to `ai`.\n6. The only assignment to `ac` is `ac = fn3(p1, o);`. We need to analyze the `fn3` function to determine if its returned value can be determined at compile-time.\n7. The `fn3` function uses the variables `p1` and `o` as its parameters. If we can determine the values of these variables at compile-time, we can propagate the constant value to `ac`.\n8.
