We need to trace the value of `p1` and `o` to see if we can determine a constant value for `ac` or replace it with a constant value.\n3. In the `main()` function, the `fn7(1)` function is called. Let's examine `fn7` to see how `ac` is assigned.\n4. In `fn7`, `ac` is assigned the value returned by `fn3(p1, o)`. The values of `p1` and `o` are passed as arguments.\n5. The value of `p1` is passed as 1, which is a constant value.\n6. The value of `o` is a global variable `o`, which does not change its value throughout the program.\n\nBased on the analysis, we can conclude that `p1` and `o` are not modified within the program, and their values are known at compile-time.

The variable `ac` is initialized with the value of `fn3(p1, o)`.\n2. The condition `if (s)` determines whether to enter the `if` block.\n3. Inside the `if` block:\n   - The variable `ad` is declared and assigned the value `0x809C`.\n   - A loop iterates from `p1` to `1`, which doesn't affect the value of `ac`.\n   - Another loop iterates from `af = 0` to `49` with a step size of `8`.
