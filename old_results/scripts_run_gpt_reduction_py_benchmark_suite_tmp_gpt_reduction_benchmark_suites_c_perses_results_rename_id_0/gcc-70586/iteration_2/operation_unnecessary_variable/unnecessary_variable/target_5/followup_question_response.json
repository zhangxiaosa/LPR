Starting from the `main` function:\n   - `fn7(1)` is called, which returns the value of `p1` (the first parameter).\n   - Since `fn7` is called with the argument `1`, the condition `if (fn7(1))` will always be true, and the subsequent code will execute.\n\n2. Inside the `fn7` function:\n   - `ac` is assigned the value returned by `fn3(p1, o)`. The value of `p1` is `1`, and `o` is a global variable whose value is not provided.
