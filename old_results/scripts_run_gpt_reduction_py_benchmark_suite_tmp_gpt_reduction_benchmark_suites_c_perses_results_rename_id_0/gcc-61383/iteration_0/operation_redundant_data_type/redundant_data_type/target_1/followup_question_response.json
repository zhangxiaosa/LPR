The program declares three variables:\n   - `m` of type `f`\n   - `n` of type `d`\n   - `o` of type `signed`\n\n5. The program defines a function `fn6` which returns an `e` value. The function contains a loop that iterates while `n` is less than `12`. Within the loop, a temporary variable `temp` of type `e` is declared.
