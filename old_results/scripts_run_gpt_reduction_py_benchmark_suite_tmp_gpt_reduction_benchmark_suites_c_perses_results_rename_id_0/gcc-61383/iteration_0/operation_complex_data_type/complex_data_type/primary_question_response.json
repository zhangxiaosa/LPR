The program starts with the function `int fn1(int p1, int p2)`. It has two parameters of type `int` and returns an `int` value. No complex data types are present here.\n\n2. Next, we have the function `int fn3(int p1, int p2)`. It also has two `int` parameters and returns an `int`. No complex data types are present in this function as well.\n\n3. After that, we encounter the variable declarations:\n   - `unsigned f;`: This is of type `unsigned`, which is not a complex data type.\n   - `unsigned n;`: Another `unsigned` variable, not a complex data type.\n   - `int o;`: An `int` variable, not a complex data type.\n\n4. Moving on to function `short fn6()`, we see a `for` loop using variable `n` which is of type `unsigned`, not a complex data type. Inside the loop, we have variable declarations:\n   - `short temp;`: This is of type `short`, which is not a complex data type.\n   - `int temp2 = 0xE3L;`: An `int` variable declaration, not a complex data type.\n\n5. Finally, we have the `main()` function, which calls `fn6()`. No variable declarations are present here.\n\nBased on the analysis, the variables with complex data types are `temp` and `temp2`.
