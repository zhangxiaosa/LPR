In the function `fn1`, the expression `fn1_p1 % p2` depends on the value of `p2`.\n5. In the function `fn3`, the expression `fn3_p1 + p2` depends on the value of `p2`.\n6. In the main program, `fn1` is called with `o` as the argument for both `fn1_p1` and `p2`.\n7. The result of `fn1` is assigned to the variable `temp`.\n8.

In the `fn3` function, the variable `p2` is used as a parameter and added to the variable `fn3_p1`. There are multiple conditions where `p2` is compared with 0 and used in expressions, but it doesn't affect the outcome of the function.\n\n3.

The `fn1` function is called with the same parameter `o` twice, but the optimization doesn't affect the computation.\n\n5. The value of `temp` is then used in an `if` statement, but it doesn't affect the control flow because the `if` and subsequent `else if` statements don't have any code inside them.\n\n6.

In the `fn1` function, the first parameter `fn1_p1` is directly returned if `p2` is 0. Otherwise, the result of `fn1_p1 % p2` is returned.
