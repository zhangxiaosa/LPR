The program starts with the declaration of two functions `fn1` and `fn3` with return type `int` and two parameters of type `int`.\n2. Within the `fn3` function, there are multiple operations involving the `int` data type variables `p1` and `p2`.\n3. Two variables `n` and `o` are declared as `unsigned` and `int` respectively at the global scope.\n4. The `main` function begins with a `for` loop that iterates as long as `n` is less than 12.\n5. Inside the `for` loop, a local variable `temp` of type `int` is declared.\n6. Following that, there is an `if` statement with a condition involving the comparison of `0x4F92L` with the result of the function call `fn1(o, o)` and the value 6.\n7. There are two more `else if` statements, each with conditions involving the comparison of `o` with a specific value.\n8.

The program consists of two function definitions (`fn1` and `fn3`), a declaration of two variables (`n` and `o`), and the `main` function.\n\n2. Starting with the `fn1` function:\n   - The function takes two parameters (`p1` and `p2`) of type `int`.\n   - It returns the result of the expression `p2 == 0 ? p1 : p1 % p2`.\n   - There are no variables with complex data types in this function.\n\n3. Moving to the `fn3` function:\n   - It also takes two parameters (`p1` and `p2`) of type `int`.\n   - It returns the result of the complex expression.\n   - Within the expression, there are no variables with complex data types.\n\n4. Next, we have the declaration of two variables (`n` and `o`) at the global scope. Both variables are of type `int`.\n\n5. Finally, we reach the `main` function:\n   - It initializes a `for` loop with an initial condition (`n < 12`).\n   - The loop's iteration updates `n` using the `fn3` function.\n   - Inside the loop, there is a declaration of a local variable named `temp` of type `int`.\n   - The condition `0x4F92L < (temp = fn1(o, o), 6)` is evaluated, where `temp` is assigned the result of `fn1(o, o)`.\n   - There are no variables with complex data types within the condition.\n   - The `else if` conditions and the subsequent statements do not introduce any variables with complex data types.\n\nBased on this analysis, the variables with complex data types are empty (i.e., there are no variables with complex data types).
