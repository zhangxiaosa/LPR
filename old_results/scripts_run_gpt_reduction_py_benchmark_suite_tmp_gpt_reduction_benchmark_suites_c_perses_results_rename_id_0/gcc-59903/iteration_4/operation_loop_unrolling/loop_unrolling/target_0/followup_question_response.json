Here's the step-by-step analysis and modified program:\n\n1. Since the loop condition is simply `a`, we can unroll the loop by substituting each iteration of the loop manually.\n2. The loop increment is `a += 4`, indicating that `a` is incremented by 4 in each iteration. We need to determine the number of unrolled iterations to ensure the same effect.\n3. We'll assume the initial value of `a` is `a_0`.\n4. For each iteration of the loop, the value of `a` will be `a_i = a_0 + 4 * i`, where `i` is the iteration number (starting from 0).\n5. We'll determine the number of unrolled iterations by calculating `(a_i - a_0) / 4` and rounding up to the nearest integer.\n6.
