Before we proceed with the inlining, let's analyze the program step by step:\n\n1. The program defines several typedefs for different types (`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`).\n2. The function `fn1` is defined, which takes two parameters (`d p1` and `int p2`) and returns a `d`. It compares `p1` with `p2` and returns the greater value if `p1 > p2` or the result of left-shifting `p1` by `p2` if `p1 <= p2`.\n3. The struct `i` is defined, which has three members (`a j`, `a k`, and `c l`).\n4. An array `m` of type `e` is declared with 4 elements.\n5. An array `n` of type `struct i` is declared with 2 elements.\n6. The function `fn3` is defined, which takes one parameter (`p1`) and returns a `d`. Inside `fn3`, there is a 2D array `q` of type `d` with dimensions 7x7. It also declares a struct `i` variable `r`, an `e` variable `s`, and initializes them.\n7. Inside `fn3`, there is an `if` statement with a function call to `fn2` passing the arguments `p1`, `r`, `s`, and `q[0][0]`. The result of the function call is discarded.\n8. The function `fn3` returns `p1`.\n9. The function `fn2` is defined, which takes four parameters (`c p1`, `struct i p2`, `e p3`, and `b p4`) and returns a `struct i`. It initializes a struct `i` variable `v` with the values `0x15L` and `-5L`. It declares two `c` variables `w` and `a`.\n10. Inside `fn2`, there is an `if-else` statement that checks the result of bitwise XOR operation between `p4` and `v.k`. Depending on the result, `v` is either updated with `n[1]` or remains unchanged.\n11. Inside `fn2`, there is a `for` loop, starting with `w` and ending when `w` becomes zero. Inside the loop, there are two nested `for` loops: one for `p3` and another for `p2.j`.\n12. Inside the nested loops in `fn2`, the value of `n[0]` is updated to `v`, `v.l` is set to `m[p2.j]`, and a new `struct i` variable `b` is declared. There is an `if-else` statement where `w` is updated based on a condition involving a call to `fn1`. Inside the `else` block, `n[0]` is updated with `b` in a `for` loop.\n13. `fn2` returns `p2`.\n14.
