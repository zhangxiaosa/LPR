Inside the `for` loop, there is a nested `while` loop.\n5. The `while` loop condition checks if `q` is greater than `s`.\n6. Inside the `while` loop, `q` is decremented by 1.\n7. The `while` loop continues until `q` becomes less than or equal to `s`.\n8. After the nested `while` loop, the next statement is an `if` condition.\n9. The `if` condition assigns the value of `q` to `p` (`p = q`).\n10. If the assignment `p = q` is true (non-zero), the empty statement `;` is executed.\n11.
