We start by analyzing the program and identifying the target variable to be optimized, which in this case is `p2`.\n\n2. Constant propagation: In constant propagation, we replace the uses of a variable with its constant value if it can be determined at compile-time. In this program, `p2` is not a constant, so constant propagation does not apply.\n\n3. Copy propagation: In copy propagation, we replace the uses of a variable with its assigned value. Let's analyze the program to see if we can apply copy propagation to optimize out `p2`:\n\n   - In the `main` function, `fn2` is called with `checksum` and a constant value of `3` as arguments. Since `3` is a known constant, we can replace `p2` with `3` inside the `fn2` function.\n\n   - The value returned by `fn2` is assigned to `checksum`. Since `p2` is unused in the `fn2` function and its value is already known to be `3`, we can eliminate the assignment of `p2` and directly assign `3` to `checksum`.\n\n4. After applying copy propagation, the optimized version of the program becomes:\n```c\nchar fn2(int p1) {\n  return p1;\n}\n\nint u;\nint v3;\n\nint main() {\n  int checksum = 2;\n  for (; u < 51; ++u) {\n    v3 = checksum;\n    checksum = fn2(checksum);\n    checksum = checksum + 0x9EE7F9D1C772505B;\n  }\n  printf(\"checksum = %d\\n\", v3);\n  return 0;\n}\n```\n\n5.
