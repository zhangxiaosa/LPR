In the `main()` function, we see that `p2` is passed as an argument to the `fn6()` function. Since `p2` is not used elsewhere in `fn6()`, we can optimize it out by directly passing the constant value of `p2` to `fn6()`. Modify the line as follows:\n   ```c\n   if (w >= (fn7(4UL, fn6(0xDC6F3D13L, au_1_decomposed[4][1][5] = fn8(~(fn3(ak, fn2(ap, 1L)) != 0), 0xDC6F3D13L)) > 2))\n   ```\n\n2. In the `fn8()` function call within the `if` condition, `p2` is being used as the second argument in the addition operation. Since `p2` is not used elsewhere in `fn8()`, we can optimize it out by directly adding the constant value of `p2`.
