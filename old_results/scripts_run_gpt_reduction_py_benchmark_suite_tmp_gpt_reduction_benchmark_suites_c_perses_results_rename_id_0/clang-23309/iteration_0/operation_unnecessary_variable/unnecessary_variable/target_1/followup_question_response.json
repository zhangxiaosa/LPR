The steps to optimize the code are as follows:\n\n1. In the `main` function, remove the assignment `fn13()` since `fn13` doesn't have any side effects or useful return value.\n2. In the `fn13` function, we observe that the value of `ao` is assigned as `0xBCD1L` and is never modified or used. Therefore, we can safely remove the declaration and assignment of `ao`.\n3. In the `if` statement condition `(ao - (fn6(am, an) - 0xECL)) - p2 & 1UL`, since `ao` is no longer used, we can remove the entire condition block and the subsequent assignment `v = 1UL`.\n4. After performing the optimizations, the `fn13` function becomes:\n```c\nint fn13() {\n  int af = 0x2F2F6D26L;\n  long am = 1L;\n  int an;\n  for (w = 3; w; w -= 1)\n    if (an = 250UL) {\n      unsigned p2 = ac || (an = w) == 0x294A85636008822DLL;\n      if (false)  // Removed condition block\n        v = 1UL;\n    }\n  return af;\n}\n```\n5. Finally, update `main` function to only call `fn13` and remove the assignment `p = v` since `v` is not used.

Copy propagation: We look for assignments where `ao` value is copied to another variable, and replace the usages of that variable with the constant value.\n\nLet's analyze the program step by step:\n\n1. The variable `ao` is initialized with the constant value `0xBCD1L`.\n2. Inside the `for` loop, the function `fn6(am, an)` is called, which subtracts `am` and `an` and returns the result.\n3. The result of `fn6` is then subtracted by `0xECL`.\n4. The subtraction result is subtracted by the variable `ao`.\n5. Finally, the subtraction result is compared to `p2` using bitwise AND with `1UL`.\n\nThe variable `ao` is only used within the subtraction operation, and it is not directly involved in any conditional statements or assignments to other variables.
