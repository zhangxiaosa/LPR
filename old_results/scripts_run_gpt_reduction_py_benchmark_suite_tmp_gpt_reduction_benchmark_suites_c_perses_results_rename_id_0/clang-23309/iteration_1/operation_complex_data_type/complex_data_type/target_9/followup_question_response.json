Identify the primary data types used in the program:\n   - `unsigned`\n   - `long`\n   - `short`\n   - `int`\n\n2. Decompose the variables with complex data types into variables with primary data types:\n   - `unsigned p` can remain as is since it is already a primary data type.\n   - `long v` can remain as is since it is already a primary data type.\n   - `short w` can remain as is since it is already a primary data type.\n   - `short ac = 1L` can be replaced with `short ac = 1`.\n\n3. Identify the relevant code for the optimization target (`w`):\n   - In the function `fn13()`, the variable `w` is assigned the value of `3` in the for loop.\n\n4. Optimize the target variable (`w`):\n   - As the value of `w` is assigned `3` and never modified within the loop, it can be optimized to directly use `3` instead of the variable `w`.\n\n5. Update the optimized code with the decomposed variables:\n   - Replace the assignment `w = 3` with `int w = 3;` at the beginning of the `fn13()` function.\n\n6.
