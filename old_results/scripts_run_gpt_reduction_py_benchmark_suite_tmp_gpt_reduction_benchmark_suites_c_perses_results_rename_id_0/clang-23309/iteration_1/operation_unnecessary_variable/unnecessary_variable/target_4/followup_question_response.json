Inside the `fn13` function:\n    - Loop `w` is initialized with the value 3 and decremented by 1 in each iteration until it becomes 0.\n    - In each iteration, the condition `if (an = 250UL)` is checked.\n        - The value 250UL is assigned to `an`.\n        - The condition always evaluates to true since the assignment returns the assigned value.\n        - Inside the if-block, a local variable `p2` is assigned the value of `ac` OR the result of the comparison `(an = w) == 0x294A85636008822DLL`, which will be 0 or 1.\n        - Another local variable `ao` is assigned the value 0xBCD1L.\n        - Inside the nested if-block, a computation is performed: `(ao - (fn6(1L, an) - 0xECL)) - p2 & 1UL`.\n            - `fn6` is called with arguments 1L and `an`, and the result is subtracted from 0xECL.\n            - The difference is subtracted from `ao`.\n            - The result is compared bitwise ANDed with 1UL.\n            - If the result is non-zero, `v` is assigned the value 1UL.\n4.

Initialize `p1` with the constant value `1L` from the declaration: `unsigned p1 = 1UL;`.\n2. Evaluate the condition `(an = 250UL)` in the `if` statement. As `250UL` is a non-zero constant, the condition will always be true and `an` will be assigned the value `250UL`.\n3. Simplify the expression `(fn6(1L, an) - 0xECL)` to `(1UL - 0xECL)` since `fn6` is a simple subtraction operation with constant operands. The result is `251UL`.\n4. Replace the assignment `unsigned p2 = ac || (an = w) == 0x294A85636008822DLL;` with `unsigned p2 = ac;` as the right-hand side of the OR operator is a constant `0x294A85636008822DLL` and `an` is already assigned a value of `250UL` from the previous step.\n5. Simplify the expression `(ao - (251UL)) - p2 & 1UL` to `(ao - 251UL) & 1UL` since `p2` is now a constant `1UL (ac)` and `251UL - 1UL = 250UL`.\n6.
