The function `main` initializes a struct variable `l` and assigns values to its members:\n   ```c\n   struct c l = {24, 6738, 165};\n   ```\n\n2.

A logical AND operation is performed between `j.h` and `l.d`, and the result is assigned to the variable `n`:\n   ```c\n   int n = j.h && l.d;\n   ```\n\n4. The following expression is evaluated and assigned to `i.g`:\n   ```c\n   i.g = l.d | -(l.f && l.d) - n;\n   ```\n\nTo optimize `main` by inlining, we can replace the function call with the code contained in it.
