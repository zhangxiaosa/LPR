The program defines a variable `g` of type `unsigned`.\n2. The program defines an integer array `h` with three elements.\n3. The program defines a static variable `i` of type `unsigned`.\n4. The program defines a function `fn2` which returns an `unsigned` value.\n5. Inside `fn2`, a variable `q` of type `unsigned` is defined.\n6. Inside `fn2`, an integer array `r` with dimensions 5x9x5 is defined.\n7. Inside an if statement in `fn2`, the value of `q` is returned if the index 2 of array `h` is non-zero.\n8.
