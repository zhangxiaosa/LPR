The program defines a typedef named `a` which represents an integer data type.\n\n2. The program declares a variable `g` of type `a`.\n\n3. The program defines the main function.\n\n4. Inside the main function, the program declares a variable `i` of type `a`.\n\n5. The program initializes an integer variable `j` with the hexadecimal value `0x24F96B7B`.\n\n6. The program declares an unsigned variable `k`.\n\n7. The program enters a for loop with an unsigned variable `f` as the loop control variable.\n\n8. Inside the first for loop, there is another nested for loop that uses `j` as the loop control variable.\n\n9. After the nested for loop, the program defines a label `q`.\n\n10. The program performs bitwise right shift operation on variable `k` and assigns the result back to `k`.\n\n11. The program assigns the value of `g` to `i`.\n\n12. The program checks if `i` is non-zero using an if statement.\n\n13. Inside the if statement, the program performs bitwise left shift operation on `k` using `j` as the shift amount.\n\n14.
