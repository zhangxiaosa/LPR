To optimize the loop using loop unrolling, we need to know the value of `j` or an upper bound on its value.

Determine the number of loop iterations (`N`) that you want to unroll. This value depends on the desired performance improvement and the loop's characteristics.\n\n2. Extract the loop body (the code inside the loop) and duplicate it `N` times.\n\n3. Modify each duplicated loop body to use a different value of `j`. The new `j` values will be decremented by one in each iteration to simulate the effect of the original loop.\n\n4. Update the loop condition to reflect the modified `j` values.

Loop unrolling is a technique where the loop is manually expanded by duplicating its body multiple times.

Replace the target loop with an unrolled version by manually duplicating its body multiple times.\n2. Initialize a counter variable `unroll_count` with a value based on the desired level of unrolling. For example, if we aim to unroll the loop by a factor of 4, `unroll_count` would be set to 4.\n3. Replace the `for (; j; --j)` loop with the unrolled version that performs the same operations but with the desired number of iterations. The body of the loop is duplicated `unroll_count` times, and after each iteration, the value of `j` is decremented by 1. This can be achieved using a switch statement with cases corresponding to each iteration.\n4.
