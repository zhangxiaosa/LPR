The function `fn1` takes an `int` parameter `p2` and returns it as an `unsigned` value without any modification.

Here, `5` is a constant value.\n   - The value of `ad.o` is assigned to `ae`.\n   - `ad.o` is assigned a value of `0`.\n   - `t` is divided by the bitwise complement of `s` divided by `ae`, and the result is assigned to `r`.\n   - `ad.o` is used but not assigned to any variable.\n\nSince `p2` (the parameter of `fn1`) is used only once and its value `5` is constant, we can optimize it out by replacing all occurrences of `p2` with `5`.
