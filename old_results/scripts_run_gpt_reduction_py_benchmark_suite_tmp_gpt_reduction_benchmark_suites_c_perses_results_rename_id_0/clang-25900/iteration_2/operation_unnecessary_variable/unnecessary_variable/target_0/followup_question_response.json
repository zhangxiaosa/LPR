The `fn1(p2)` function takes an argument `p2` and simply returns it. The function call `fn1(5)` can be replaced with the constant `5`.\n\n2. The variable `ae` is assigned the value of `ad.o`. Since `ad.o` is assigned the result of `fn1(5)`, which we replaced with `5`, we can replace `ae` with `5`.\n\n3. The statement `ad.o = 0` assigns `0` to `ad.o`, which means the value assigned to `ad.o` in the previous step is overwritten. Therefore, we can remove this assignment since it has no effect on the final result.\n\n4. The statement `r = t % (4 / ae)` performs a modulo operation. Since `ae` is a constant and its value is `5`, the expression `4 / ae` can be simplified to `4 / 5`, which results in `0` (integer division).\n\n5.
