Since `main` is an empty function, it does not have any side effects, and its presence in the program is unnecessary. We can safely remove it.\n2. The program includes a typedef `d` for a vector type of `long`, but since `d` is not used anywhere in the program, it can also be removed.\n3. The function `fn2()` returns a vector of type `d`, which is initialized with the address of the function `fn1`. However, since `fn1` is an empty function and is not used anywhere, its presence is unnecessary as well. We can remove the usage of `fn1` in `fn2()`.\n4.
