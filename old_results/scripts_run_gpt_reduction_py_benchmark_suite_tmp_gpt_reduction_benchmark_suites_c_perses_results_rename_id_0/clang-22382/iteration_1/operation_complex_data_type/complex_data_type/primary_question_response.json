The program contains a `struct` declaration named `original_data_type` that has three members: `i` of type `int`, `j` of type `long`, and `k` of type `unsigned`.\n2. The function `fn1` is defined as a static function that takes three parameters: `p1` of type `unsigned`, `p2` of type `short`, and `p5` of type `struct original_data_type`. The function accesses the member `k` of `p5`.\n3. The function `fn2` is defined as an `unsigned` return type function that does not take any parameters. It declares a local variable `p` of type `struct original_data_type` and calls the function `fn1` with arguments 0, 0, and `p`.
