The program defines a struct named `original_data_type` with three members: `i` (an integer), `j` (a long integer), and `k` (an unsigned integer).\n\n2. The program declares a static function `fn1` with the following parameters: `p1` (an unsigned integer), `p2` (a short integer), and `p5` (a struct of type `original_data_type`).\n\n3.

Inside the `fn2` function, a local variable `p` of type `original_data_type` is declared.\n\n7. The `fn1` function is called with arguments `0`, `0`, and `p`.
