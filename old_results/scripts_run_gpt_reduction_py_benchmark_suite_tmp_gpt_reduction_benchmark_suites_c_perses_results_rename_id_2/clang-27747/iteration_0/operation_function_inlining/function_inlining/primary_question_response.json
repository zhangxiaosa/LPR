The program starts with a typedef declaration, defining the type `a` as a signed integer.\n\n2. The program continues with another typedef declaration, defining the type `b` as an integer.\n\n3. Next, a struct is defined with the name `c`. It has the following members:\n   - `d`, a signed integer with a width of 18 bits\n   - `e`, an unsigned integer\n   - `f`, an unsigned integer\n   - `g`, a signed integer\n   - `h`, a signed integer\n\n4. Two struct variables are declared: `i` and `j`, both of type `struct c`.\n\n5. The program defines a function named `fn1` with a return type of `b` (integer).\n   Inside the function:\n   - Another struct variable `l` of type `struct c` is declared and initialized with specific values for its members.\n   - A variable `m` of type `b` is declared and assigned the value of `j.e`.\n   - The value of `l.d` is updated with the value of `m`.\n   - Another variable `n` of type `b` is declared and assigned the logical AND of `j.h` and `l.d`.\n   - Variable `o` is assigned the value of `l.d`.\n   - A variable `p` of type `a` is declared and initialized with a complex expression.\n   - The value of `i.g` is updated with the value of `p`.\n\n6.
