First, we need to identify the uses of the target variable `temp2` in the code. In this case, `temp2` is only assigned the constant value `6` and never used anywhere else. Therefore, `temp2` can be optimized out since it has no effect on the program execution.\n\n2. The optimized version of the code will remove the assignment of `temp2` and any unused references to it. Here is the optimized code:\n\n```c\nunsigned n;\nint o;\nshort fn6() {\n  for (; n < 12; n = fn3(n, 3)) {\n    int temp1 = (o == 0) ? 0 : o % o;\n    if (0x4F92L < (temp1))\n      ;\n    else if (o <= 0xE3L)\n      ;\n    else if (temp1)\n      break;\n  }\n  return 0;\n}\n\nint main() { fn6(); }\n```\n\n3.

Since the value of `temp2` remains constant throughout the loop, we can propagate its value by replacing all occurrences of `temp2` with the constant 6.\n4. After constant propagation, the code becomes:\n\n```cpp\nshort fn6() {\n  for (; n < 12; n = fn3(n, 3)) {\n    int temp1 = (o == 0) ? 0 : o % o;\n    if (0x4F92L < (temp1, 6))\n      ;\n    else if (o <= 0xE3L)\n      ;\n    else if (temp1)\n      break;\n  }\n  return 0;\n}\n```\n\n5.
