Create a loop that performs multiple iterations instead of a single iteration:\n   - Iteration 1: Execute the loop body with `n = fn3(n, 3)`.\n   - Iteration 2: Execute the loop body with `n = fn3(n, 3)` again.\n   - Repeat this process until the desired number of iterations is reached (`n < 12`).\n3. Within each iteration of the loop body, execute the code that was originally inside the loop.

Let's unroll the loop by a factor of 4 and analyze the resulting unrolled loop:\n\n```cpp\nfor (; n < 12; n = fn3(n, 3)) {\n  // Iteration 1\n  int temp1 = o == 0 ? 0 : o % o;\n  if (o <= 0xE3L) ;\n  else if (temp1)\n    break;\n\n  // Iteration 2\n  n = fn3(n, 3);\n  int temp2 = o == 0 ? 0 : o % o;\n  if (o <= 0xE3L) ;\n  else if (temp2)\n    break;\n\n  // Iteration 3\n  n = fn3(n, 3);\n  int temp3 = o == 0 ? 0 : o % o;\n  if (o <= 0xE3L) ;\n  else if (temp3)\n    break;\n\n  // Iteration 4\n  n = fn3(n, 3);\n  int temp4 = o == 0 ? 0 : o % o;\n  if (o <= 0xE3L) ;\n  else if (temp4)\n    break;\n}\n```\n\nThe unrolled loop executes four iterations of the loop body in each iteration of the unrolled loop.
