The variable `an` is not assigned any constant value or modified directly in the program. It is only used as an argument in the function call `fn4(fn2(ap, 1L) != 0, an)`.\n\n2. The function `fn4` takes two arguments `p1` and `p2` and returns `p1`. Since `an` is passed as `p2`, we can consider replacing the call to `fn4` with `fn4(fn2(ap, 1L) != 0, p1)`.\n\n3. The function `fn2` takes two arguments `p1` and `p2` and returns `p1 && p2 ? p1 : p1 % p2`. Since `an` is used as the second argument (`p2`) of `fn2`, we can consider replacing the call to `fn2` with `fn2(ap, p2)`.\n\n4. By replacing the function calls, we can reason about the usage of `an`:\n   - The modified call to `fn4` becomes `fn4(fn2(ap, 1L) != 0, p1)`. Since `fn2(ap, 1L) != 0` is used as the first argument (`p1`) of `fn4`, the original `an` argument is not used directly.\n   - Therefore, the variable `an` is not used anywhere else in the program.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can optimize out the variable `an`.

The variable `an` is not used directly in the program. Therefore, it can be optimized out if it's not used in any indirect way.\n\n2. The variable `an` is passed as an argument to the function `fn2` in the expression `fn2(ap, 1L)`. However, the result of `fn2` is used within a conditional expression `~fn4(fn2(ap, 1L) != 0, an)`. Since the result of `fn2(ap, 1L)` is used in the condition, we cannot eliminate the argument `an` yet.\n\n3. The conditional expression `~fn4(fn2(ap, 1L) != 0, an)` is part of the assignment `au[4][1][5] = ~fn4(fn2(ap, 1L) != 0, an) + ak && 0x57L` within the call to `fn7(4UL, ...)`. Here, `au[4][1][5]` is assigned the value `~fn4(fn2(ap, 1L) != 0, an) + ak && 0x57L`, but the assignment does not depend directly on `an`. The usage of `an` is further enclosed within the bitwise complement operator `~`.
