Remove the loop (`for` statement) since it doesn't affect the execution of the code inside the loop body (`if` statement).\n   \n   ```c\n   #include <stdio.h>\n   \n   char fn2(char p1, char p2) { return p1 && p2 ? p1 : p1 % p2; }\n   \n   char q;\n   unsigned w = 0xDC6F3D13L;\n   long long ag3;\n   short ah;\n   long long ak;\n   unsigned ao;\n   unsigned ap;\n   \n   int main() {\n     ak = 0;\n     \n     unsigned assigned_value = ~((fn2(ap, 1L) != 0) + ak) && 0x57L;\n     if (w) {\n       q = 0x41AEA787L;\n       ag3 = assigned_value;\n     } else {\n       ao = assigned_value;\n     }\n     \n     printf(\"checksum = %X\\n\", q);\n     return 0;\n   }\n   ```\n\n2.

Initially, the variable `w` is assigned a value of `0xDC6F3D13L`.\n2. Inside the loop, there is a conditional statement `if (w) { ... }`. If `w` is non-zero, the code inside the if block will be executed; otherwise, the code inside the else block will be executed.\n3. After the loop completes, the value of `q` is printed.\n\nSince the value of `w` is not modified inside the loop, and it does not depend on any loop variables, unrolling the loop will not affect the result of the conditional statement.
