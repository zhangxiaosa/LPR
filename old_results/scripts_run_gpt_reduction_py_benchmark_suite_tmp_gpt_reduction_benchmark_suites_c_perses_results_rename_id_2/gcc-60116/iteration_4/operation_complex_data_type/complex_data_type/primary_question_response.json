Here are the steps for the analysis:\n\n1. Initialize an empty list to store the variable names with complex data types.\n2. Scan through the program code and identify variable declarations.\n3. Determine the data type of each variable declaration.\n4. If the data type matches one of the complex data types, add the variable name to the list.\n5. Finally, create a JSON object with the identified variable names under the key \"target_list\".\n\nApplying these steps to the given program:\n\n1. Initialize an empty list: `target_list = []`\n2. Scan through the program code and identify variable declarations:\n   - `int q;`\n   - `unsigned w = 0xDC6F3D13L;`\n   - `long long ag3;`\n   - `short ah;`\n   - `long long ak;`\n   - `unsigned ao;`\n   - `unsigned original_data_type;`\n   - No other variable declarations.\n3. Determine the data type of each variable declaration:\n   - `int q;` - Simple data type (int)\n   - `unsigned w = 0xDC6F3D13L;` - Simple data type (unsigned)\n   - `long long ag3;` - Simple data type (long long)\n   - `short ah;` - Simple data type (short)\n   - `long long ak;` - Simple data type (long long)\n   - `unsigned ao;` - Simple data type (unsigned)\n   - `unsigned original_data_type;` - Simple data type (unsigned)\n4.
