Remove the declaration of variable `j` in the `main()` function as it is not used.\n\n2. Replace the `if (g)` statement with the unrolled loop body. For example, if we choose a loop unrolling factor of 4, the unrolled loop body will look like:\n   ```cpp\n   k = k << j;\n   k = k << j;\n   k = k << j;\n   k = k << j;\n   ```\n\n3.
