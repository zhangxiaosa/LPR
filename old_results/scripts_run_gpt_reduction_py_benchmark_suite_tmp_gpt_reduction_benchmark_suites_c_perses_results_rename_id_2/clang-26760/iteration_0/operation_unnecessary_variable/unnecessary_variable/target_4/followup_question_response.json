The `fn1` function initializes variable `j` with the value `0x24F96B7BL`.\n3. The conditional statement `if (j)` checks if `j` is nonzero. Since `j` is initialized to a nonzero constant, the condition will always be true.\n4. The decrement operation `--j` reduces the value of `j` by 1. In this case, it becomes irrelevant since `j` is not used further.\n5. The variable `n` is assigned the value of `g`. The value of `g` is not given in the provided code, so we cannot perform constant propagation or copy propagation for `n`.\n6. The variable `o` is assigned the value of `n`. Since `n` already represents `g`, we can replace all occurrences of `o` with `g` if `o` is not used elsewhere.\n7. The variable `p` is assigned the value of `o`, which now represents `g`. If `p` is not used elsewhere, we can replace it with `g`.\n8. The loop labeled `q` performs bit manipulation operations on `k` and `j` until `p` becomes zero.
