The program starts with several type definitions: `typedef signed a;`, `typedef short b;`, `typedef int c;`, `typedef unsigned d;`, `typedef unsigned e;`. These definitions do not represent functions.\n\n2. Next, the program declares variables `d f;` and `a g;` which are not functions.\n\n3. After that, the program defines a function named `fn1()`:\n   ```c\n   b fn1() {\n     // function body\n   }\n   ```\n   This is the only identified function in the program.\n\n4. Finally, the program defines the `main()` function, which is the entry point of the program:\n   ```c\n   int main() {\n     // function body\n   }\n   ```\n\nBased on the analysis, there is one function other than `main()` in the program, which is `fn1()`.
