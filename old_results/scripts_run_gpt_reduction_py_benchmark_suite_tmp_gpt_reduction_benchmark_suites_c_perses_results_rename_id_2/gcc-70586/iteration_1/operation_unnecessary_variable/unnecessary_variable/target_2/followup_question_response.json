After the `if`-`else` block, `p1` is updated using a complex expression involving `fn3`, comparisons, and bitwise operations.\n8. The variable `p` is assigned the value of `p1`.\n9. The variable `ac` is updated with a function call to `fn3` using constants and the value of `p1`.\n10. The loop continues until `af` reaches or exceeds 49.\n11. If `s` is zero, a value is assigned to `t[2][0]` using function calls to `fn3` and operations involving `q`.\n12. The function `fn8` is defined but contains an empty `if` block.\n13. The `main` function calls `fn8`.\n\nTo optimize out the variable `af`, we can see that it is only used as the loop control variable and for comparisons inside the loop.
