The target variable `ac` is first initialized with the return value of the `fn3` function, where `p1` is the argument passed and `o` is the global variable.\n2. Since the value of `o` is not modified in the program, we can replace `o` with its constant value to optimize the function call. Assuming `o` is a constant value `O`, the statement becomes `int ac = fn3(p1, O);`.\n3. The next statement checks if the value of `s` is non-zero. If it is zero, the subsequent statements are not executed, and the function exits without modifying `ac`. This means that the initial value of `ac` remains unchanged.\n4. Inside the `if (s)` block, there are loops and conditional statements. However, none of them modify the value of `ac` directly, so we can safely ignore those statements for the purpose of optimizing `ac`.\n5. After analyzing the `if (s)` block, we can conclude that the final value of `ac` remains the same as its initial value, `fn3(p1, O)`.\n6.
