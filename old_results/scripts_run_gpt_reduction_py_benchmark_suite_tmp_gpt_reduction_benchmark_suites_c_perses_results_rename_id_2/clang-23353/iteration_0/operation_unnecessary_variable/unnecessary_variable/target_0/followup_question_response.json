By copy propagation, if `p1` is copied to any other variable, we can replace the uses of that variable with the constant value of `p1`.\n\nLet's analyze the given program:\n\n1. The function `fn1` takes two parameters `p1` and `p2`, and it returns the product of `p1` and `p2`.\n2. The variable `i` is declared in the global scope and is accessible to all functions.\n3. The variable `j_h` is declared in the global scope and is accessible to all functions.\n4. The function `fn2` takes three parameters: an unsigned integer `p1`, a pointer to an integer `p2`, and a character `p3`.\n5. In the `fn2` function, there is a loop that iterates from `p3 = 6` until `p3 != -7`, decrementing `p3` in each iteration.\n6. Inside the loop, `j_h` is updated by performing a bitwise XOR operation with the result of `fn1(p3, i)` and the constant `1`.\n7. The loop uses `p3` as the first argument and `i` as the second argument while calling the `fn1` function.\n8. The `fn2` function returns the pointer `p2`.\n9. The `main` function is present but does not contain any code.\n\nBased on the analysis, the variable `p1` is not used in the given program.
