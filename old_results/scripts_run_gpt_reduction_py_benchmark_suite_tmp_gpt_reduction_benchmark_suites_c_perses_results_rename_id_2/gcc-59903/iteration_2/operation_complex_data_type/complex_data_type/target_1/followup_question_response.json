The original program contains the following variables:\n   - `unsigned k;` (unsigned int)\n   - `unsigned m[4];` (array of unsigned int)\n   - `unsigned n0;` (unsigned int)\n   - `unsigned r;` (unsigned int)\n   - `unsigned s;` (unsigned int)\n   - `unsigned v;` (unsigned int)\n   - `unsigned w;` (unsigned int)\n   - `unsigned a;` (unsigned int)\n\n2.
