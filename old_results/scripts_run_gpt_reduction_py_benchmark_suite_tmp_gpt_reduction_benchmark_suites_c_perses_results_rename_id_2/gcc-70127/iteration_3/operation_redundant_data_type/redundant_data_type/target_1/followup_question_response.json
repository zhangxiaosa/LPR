The struct \"p\" contains two members, \"ab\" and \"q\", both of which are integers. We need to substitute every instance of \"struct p\" with its associated original data type, which is \"int\".\n\n4.

In the main function, the variable \"struct p a\" is declared and initialized with values. We need to substitute \"struct p\" with \"int\" in this declaration as well.\n\n6.
