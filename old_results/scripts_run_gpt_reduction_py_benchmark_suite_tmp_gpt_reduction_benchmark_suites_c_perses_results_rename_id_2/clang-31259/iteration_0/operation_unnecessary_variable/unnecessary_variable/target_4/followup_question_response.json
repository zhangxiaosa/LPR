The variable `k` is declared in the `main` function and used as the loop variable in a nested loop.\n2. The nested loop iterates from 0 to 6 (`k = 0; k < 7; k++`).\n3. The optimization goal is to optimize out the variable `k`.\n4. Since `k` is a loop variable and it's used in the loop condition and loop body, it cannot be directly optimized out through constant or copy propagation.\n5.

The constant expression for the loop condition can be determined by evaluating the loop bounds.\n7.
