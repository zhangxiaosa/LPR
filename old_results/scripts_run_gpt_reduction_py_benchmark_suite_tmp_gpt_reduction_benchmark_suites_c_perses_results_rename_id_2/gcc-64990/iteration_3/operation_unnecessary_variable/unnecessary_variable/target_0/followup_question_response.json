The target variable to optimize is `h`, which is initially assigned the value `0xCAL`.\n2. In the function `fn2`, there is an `if` statement checking the value of `h`. If `h` is non-zero, the function returns the value stored in `j[g][g]`.\n3. However, since `h` is never modified, it remains constant throughout the program.\n4. When the function `fn1` is called in `fn3`, it passes the value `0` as an argument to `fn2`.\n5. Since `fn2` never modifies `h` and the `if` condition checking `h` is always false, the return statement `return j[g][g];` is never executed.\n6.
