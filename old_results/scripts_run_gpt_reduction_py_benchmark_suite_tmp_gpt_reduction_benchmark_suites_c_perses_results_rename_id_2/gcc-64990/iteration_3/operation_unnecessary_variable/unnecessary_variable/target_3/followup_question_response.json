The `m` variable is the target to be optimized.\n2. We need to find all the places where `m` is used.\n3. In the given program, `m` is used in the `fn1` function, but it is assigned a value based on the `p1` parameter, which cannot be optimized at compile-time.\n4. Therefore, we cannot optimize out the usage of `m` in the `fn1` function.\n5. In the `fn2` function, `m` is not used, so we can optimize it out.\n6. In the `main` function, the `fn3` function is called, but there is no usage of `m` in `fn3`.\n7. Hence, we can optimize out the usage of `m` in the `fn3` function.\n8.
