Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:\n\n1. In the main function, `fn3()` is called.\n2. `fn3()` calls `fn1(fn2(0), 7, 7, 0)` and returns the value of `n`.\n3. `fn2(0)` is called from `fn1()`.\n4. In `fn2(p1)`, there is a loop that breaks if `k` is true. Inside the loop, `v[g][l + 1][l]` is returned.\n5. If `h` is true, `j[g][g]` is returned. Otherwise, the loop continues.\n6. After the loop, there is an empty `for` loop that does nothing. `w` is returned.\n7. `fn1()` is called from `fn3()` with some arguments, but `l` is not used in this function.\n\nBased on this analysis, `l` is only used in the expression `v[g][l + 1][l]` inside the loop in `fn2()`.

Here's the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. The initial value of `l` is not explicitly defined, so we need to look for its usages.\n2. In the function `fn2`, the expression `v[g][l + 1][l]` is used. We see that `g` and `l` are used as indices.\n3. Since `g` is a static short variable with a constant initial value of `0x7EBAL`, we can replace `g` with its constant value in the expression.\n4. However, `l` does not have a constant initial value, so we cannot replace it directly.\n5. To perform copy propagation, we need to analyze the control flow of the program and find any assignments to `l`.\n6. The main assignment to `l` is found in `fn2` where `l` is updated through the expression `l + 1`.\n7. We notice that the assignment to `l` is conditional on the condition `k` in the statement `if (k)`.\n8. If `k` is non-zero, the assignment to `l` will not be executed, and the value of `l` will remain unchanged.\n9. As a result, we can conclude that the value of `l` remains constant throughout the program because `k` is never set to 0.\n10. Therefore, we can optimize out the variable `l` by replacing all its usages with its constant initial value of `0`.\n11.
