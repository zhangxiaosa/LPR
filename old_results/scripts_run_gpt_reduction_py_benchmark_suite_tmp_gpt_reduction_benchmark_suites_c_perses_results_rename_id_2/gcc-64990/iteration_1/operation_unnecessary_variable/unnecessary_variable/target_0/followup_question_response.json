Remove the assignment statements to `i` within the loops in `fn2()`.\n3. Remove the loop variable `i` from the loop in `fn2()`.\n4.

The function `fn2` takes an unspecified parameter `p1`. It declares a local array `v` of size 6x3x2. It enters an infinite loop and breaks if `k` is non-zero, returning `v[g][l + 1][l]`. If `k` is zero, it checks if `h` is non-zero, in which case it does nothing. Otherwise, it returns `j[g][g]`. After the loop, there is an empty loop to iterate `p1` without any code inside it. Finally, it returns the value `0x709BFC8AL`.\n10. The function `fn3` has no parameters. It calls `fn2(0)` and `fn1(..., 7)`, discarding the return values. It returns 0.\n11. The `main` function has no parameters.
