Analyze function `fn2()`:\n\n```\nint fn2(p1) {\n  unsigned v[6][3][2];\n  for (i = 0;;) {\n    if (k)\n      break;\n    return v[g][l + 1][l];\n  }\n  if (h)\n    ;\n  else\n    return j[g][g];\n  for (; p1;) {\n  }\n  return 0x709BFC8AL;\n}\n```\n\nIn the `for` loop, `i` is set to 0. However, the loop is infinite since there is no terminating condition. Therefore, `i` remains constant with a value of 0.\n\n3.

The target variable to be optimized is `i`.\n2. `i` is initially declared as a global variable of type `short`.\n3. There are multiple instances where `i` is used:\n   - In the `fn2` function, it is assigned the value of 0 in the loop (`for (i = 0;;)`).\n   - In the same function, it is used as an index in the expression `v[g][l + 1][l]` which is returned when `k` is non-zero.\n   - In the `main` function, `fn3` is called, which indirectly invokes `fn2` where `i` is used.\n4. Based on the usage analysis, we can conclude that `i` is being used as an index in the expression `v[g][l + 1][l]`, and its initial assignment to 0 is unnecessary.\n5.
