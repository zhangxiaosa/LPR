The idea is to perform multiple iterations of the loop at once, reducing the number of loop iterations and improving performance.\n\nIn the given program, the target condition is inside the innermost loop. Let's unroll the innermost loop by a factor of 2:\n\n```cpp\nfor (p2 = 0; p2 <= 7; p2 += 2) {\n  for (p4 = 0; p4 <= 7; p4 += 1) {\n    if (h < 0) {\n      if (ak[p3]) {\n        break;\n      }\n    }\n\n    p4 += 1; // Additional increment to account for the unrolled iterations\n\n    if (h < 0) {\n      if (ak[p3 + 1]) {\n        break;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  p2 += 1; // Additional increment to account for the unrolled iterations\n}\n```\n\nIn the unrolled version, we have merged two iterations of the innermost loop into a single iteration.
