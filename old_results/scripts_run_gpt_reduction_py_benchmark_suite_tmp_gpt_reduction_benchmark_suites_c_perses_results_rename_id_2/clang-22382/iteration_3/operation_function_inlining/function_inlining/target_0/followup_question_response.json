The `fn1` function takes a `struct h` parameter `p5` but doesn't perform any useful computation. It only references `p5.k` and then enters an infinite loop using a `goto` statement.\n3.

The function `fn1` takes a `struct h` parameter `p5` and returns a `struct h`. It has a single statement that accesses `p5.k` and then goes into an infinite loop using a `goto` statement.\n\n3.
