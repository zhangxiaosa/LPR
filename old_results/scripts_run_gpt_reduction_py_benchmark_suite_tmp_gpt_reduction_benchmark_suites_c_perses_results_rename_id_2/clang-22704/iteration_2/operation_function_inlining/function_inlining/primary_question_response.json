The program defines the global variable `f` of type `int`.\n2. The program defines a function named `fn1`.\n3. Inside the `fn1` function, there is an if statement that checks the value of `f`.\n4. If `f` is true (non-zero), the `fn1` function calls itself recursively and then returns 0.\n5. If `f` is false (0), the value of `f` is set to 6 and then the `fn1` function is called recursively.\n6. The `fn1` function returns 0 at the end.\n7. The program also defines the `main` function, which has no statements inside.\n8.
