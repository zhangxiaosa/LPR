Inside the `if` statement, `ab` is assigned the value of `ac || (an = w) == 0x294A85636008822DLL`.\n   - Since `ac` is initialized to `1L`, the expression `ac || (an = w) == 0x294A85636008822DLL` will always evaluate to `1` (true) because `ac` is non-zero.\n   - Therefore, `ab` will always be assigned the value `1`.\n3.
