Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:\n\n1. The variable `an` is initialized inside the `if` statement: `if (an = 250U)`. The assignment `an = 250U` can be optimized to `an = 250` since `250U` is an unsigned constant.\n\n2. The condition `(an = w) == 0x294A85636008822DLL` is used to assign a value to `ab`. Since `an` is now a constant value of `250`, the condition will always be false. Therefore, `ab` can be optimized to `ab = ac`.\n\n3. The function `fn3(ao, ao - an)` is called with the arguments `ao` and `ao - an`. Since `an` is now a constant value of `250`, the expression `ao - an` can be simplified to `ao - 250`.\n\n4.
