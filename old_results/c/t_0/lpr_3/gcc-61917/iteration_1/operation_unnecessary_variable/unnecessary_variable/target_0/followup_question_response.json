The function `fn3` is defined, which takes a parameter `p1` of type `d`.\n3. Inside the function `fn3`, a local variable `o` of type `a` is declared.\n4.

Inside the inner loop, the variable `k` is assigned the value 0, and the loop continues as long as `k` is greater than or equal to -27. In each iteration, `k` is decremented by 6.\n7. Inside the innermost loop, the parameter `p1` is updated by subtracting `o` from it.\n8.
