Enter a `for` loop with an uninitialized variable `f` as the loop condition.\n\n3. Enter a nested `for` loop with an empty condition and a decrement of `j` in the loop body. This loop will execute until `j` becomes zero.\n\n4. Assign the value of `j` to variable `m`.\n\n5. Assign the value of `g` to variable `n`.\n\n6. Assign the value of `n` to variable `o`.\n\n7.
