The target variable to be optimized is `p3` in the `fn2` function.\n2. The `fn2` function contains a loop that iterates from `p3 = 6` until `p3 != -7`, decrementing `p3` by 1 in each iteration.\n3. Inside the loop, the `fn1` function is called with `p3` and `i` as arguments, and the result is bitwise XORed with `j_h` and `1L`.\n4.
