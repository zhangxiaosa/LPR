Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:\n\n1. The variable `an` is initialized inside the `for` loop as `an = 250UL`.\n2. The condition `an = 250UL` is always true because it assigns the value `250UL` to `an` and then checks if the assigned value is non-zero. This condition can be simplified to `true`.\n3. The assignment `an = w` is performed inside the `if` statement. Since `w` is decremented in the `for` loop, the value of `w` will be `0` when the loop terminates.
