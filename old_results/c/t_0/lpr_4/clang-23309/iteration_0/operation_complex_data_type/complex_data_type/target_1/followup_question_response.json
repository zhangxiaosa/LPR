The program defines several functions:\n   - `void fn1(unsigned p1, int p2)`: This function takes an unsigned integer `p1` and an integer `p2` as parameters and prints the checksum of `p1`.\n   - `char fn4(char p1, char p2)`: This function takes two characters `p1` and `p2` as parameters and returns `p1`.\n   - `unsigned fn5(unsigned p1, unsigned p2)`: This function takes two unsigned integers `p1` and `p2` as parameters and returns `p2`.\n   - `char fn10(unsigned p1, short p2)`: This function takes an unsigned integer `p1` and a short integer `p2` as parameters. It defines an integer `af` and a character `ag`, calls `fn11` with some arguments, and returns `af`.\n   - `char fn11(char p1, unsigned p2, int p3, short p4)`: This function takes a character `p1`, an unsigned integer `p2`, an integer `p3`, and a short integer `p4` as parameters. It defines a long integer `ai` and a short integer `aj`, calls `fn12` with some arguments, and returns `aj`.\n   - `short fn12(int p1, int p2, char p3, short p4, unsigned p5)`: This function takes two integers `p1` and `p2`, a character `p3`, a short integer `p4`, and an unsigned integer `p5` as parameters. It defines an integer `al`, a long integer `am`, and an integer `an`. It then enters a loop where it checks the value of `w` and performs some calculations. Finally, it returns `al`.\n   - `int fn13()`: This function has no parameters. It defines a short integer `ae`, calls `fn10` with some arguments, and returns `ae`.\n\n3.
