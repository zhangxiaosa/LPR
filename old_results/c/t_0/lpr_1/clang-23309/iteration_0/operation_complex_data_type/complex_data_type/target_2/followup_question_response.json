The `fn10` function takes two parameters: `p1` of type `unsigned` and `p2` of type `short`. It initializes several variables, including `af`, `am`, and `an`.\n\n3.

The expression `fn4(am - an, 0xECL)` is passed as an argument to `fn3`. The subtraction `am - an` can be simplified to `am - 250UL`, as `an` is always assigned `250UL` in the previous step.\n\n5.
