Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:\n\n1. The variable `r` is declared inside the `fn1` function.\n2. Since `r` is declared inside a loop and not used outside of it, we can optimize it out by removing the loop entirely.\n3. The loop condition `for (;;) { ... }` indicates an infinite loop, so we can remove the loop and its contents.\n4. The only statement remaining inside `fn1` is `g = r[0x06D7L][0x06D7L][0x06D7L];`.\n5. Since `r` is no longer used, we can remove the assignment statement as well.\n6. The `fn1` function now becomes an empty function: `signed fn1(unsigned n) {}`.\n7. The `fn2` function calls `fn1(0)` and returns the value of `j`.\n8. Since `fn1` is now an empty function, we can remove the call to `fn1(0)` as it has no effect.\n9.
