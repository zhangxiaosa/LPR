Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:\n\n1. The variable `h_decomposed` is initialized with constant values `{0x92A1D2CDL, 0x92A1D2CDL, 0x92A1D2CDL}`.\n\n2. In the function `fn1`, there is an `if` condition `if (h_decomposed[2])` that checks the value of `h_decomposed[2]`. Since `h_decomposed` is a constant array, we can replace `h_decomposed[2]` with its constant value `0x92A1D2CDL`.\n\n3. The statement `g = r[i][i][i]` assigns the value of `r[i][i][i]` to the variable `g`. Since `i` is a constant variable initialized with `0x06D7L`, we can replace `r[i][i][i]` with `r[0x06D7L][0x06D7L][0x06D7L]`.\n\n4. The function `fn2` calls `fn1` with arguments `f`, `e`, `e`, and `e`. Since `f` is an unsigned variable and `e` is a signed variable, we need to ensure that the types match.
