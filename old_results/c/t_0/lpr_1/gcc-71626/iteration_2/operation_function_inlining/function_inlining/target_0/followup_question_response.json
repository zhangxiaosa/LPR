Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:\n\n1. The program defines a function `fn1` that takes no arguments and has no return value. The function is empty, so it doesn't perform any operations.\n\n2. The program defines a type `d` using a typedef. The type `d` is a vector of `long` elements, with the size equal to the size of the variable `a`.\n\n3. The program defines a function `fn2` that returns a value of type `d`. Inside `fn2`, a variable `f` of type `d` is declared and initialized with the address of the `fn1` function. The address of `fn1` is assigned to `f` because the function `fn1` is treated as a constant value.\n\n4. The `fn2` function returns the value of `f`.\n\n5.
