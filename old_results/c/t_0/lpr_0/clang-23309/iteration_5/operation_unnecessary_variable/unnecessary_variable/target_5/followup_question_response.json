Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:\n\n1. The variable `p2` is not used in the given program, so it can be optimized out.\n\n2. The variable `p1` is used in the function `fn3`, but its value is not constant. Therefore, constant propagation cannot be applied to optimize `p1`.\n\n3. The variable `p` is assigned the value `1L` inside the `if` statement. Since `p` is not used outside the `if` statement, we can optimize it out by removing the assignment.\n\n4. The variable `t` is assigned the result of the expression `ac || (an = w) == 0x294A85636008822DL`. The value of `ac` is `1L`, and the value of `w` is `3` in the loop. Therefore, the assignment `an = w` will always be executed, and the expression will always evaluate to `1L`.
