Based on the provided program, the complex data types used are:\n\n1. `unsigned long long` (e.g., `0x294A85636008822DLL`)\n2. `unsigned char` (e.g., `unsigned char fn4(unsigned p1, unsigned p2)`)\n3. `unsigned` (e.g., `unsigned p`)\n4. `long` (e.g., `long fn3(long p1, long p2)`)\n5. `short` (e.g., `short w`, `short ac`, `short ao`)\n\nWe need to decompose these complex data types into variables with primary data types.
