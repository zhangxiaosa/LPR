Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:\n\n1. In the `fn10` function, the variable `an` is assigned the value `250UL` in the `if` condition. Since this assignment is constant, we can propagate the constant value `250UL` to all occurrences of `an` within the `if` block.\n\n2. The condition `(an = w) == 0x294A85636008822DLL` in the `if` statement is always false because `an` is assigned the value `250UL` in the previous step. Therefore, the assignment `p2 = ac || (an = w) == 0x294A85636008822DLL` can be simplified to `p2 = ac`.\n\n3.

The assignment `v = 1UL` within the `if` block can be propagated to the outer scope.\n\n10.
