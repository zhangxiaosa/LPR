Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. In the function `fn10`, the variable `am` is assigned the constant value `1L` in the line `long am = 1L;`. This is a constant assignment.\n\n2. Inside the `if` statement in the `for` loop of `fn10`, the expression `am - an` is passed as an argument to the function `fn4`. Since `am` is a constant value of `1L`, the expression `am - an` can be simplified to `1L - an`.\n\n3.
