The `fn3` function returns the value of `p1`.\n11. The `main` function calls the `fn3` function with the argument `1` and checks if the return value is non-zero.

Inside the loop, there is an `if` statement that checks the value of `i`.\n11. If `i` is true (non-zero), a `printf` statement is executed, printing the value of `l`.\n12.
