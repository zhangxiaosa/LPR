The program defines another function named `fn3` that takes a single parameter (`p1`) and returns an unsigned integer. Inside the function, a short integer variable `m` is declared and initialized with the hexadecimal value `0x809C`.\n4.

The result is assigned to `p1`.\n6. There is an `if` statement that checks the value of the variable `i`. If `i` is non-zero, it prints the integer `0` using `printf`. This line also seems unnecessary as `printf` is called with an incorrect format specifier.\n7. Finally, the function `fn3` is called with the argument `1` inside the `if` statement in the `main` function.

The program defines a function `fn3` that takes a parameter `p1` but does not specify its data type. By default, when no data type is specified, it is assumed to be `int`. The function `fn3` has a local variable `m` of type `short` initialized with the hexadecimal value `0x809C`.\n\n4. The program calls the `printf` function to print a formatted string. It uses the format specifier `%lld` to print a `long long` integer. The corresponding argument is cast to `long long` and passed as `(long long)0`, which is the value `0` cast to `long long`.\n\n5. The program assigns the value returned by calling `fn2` with two arguments: `(0x60781BCD >= m ^ 4294967287UL)` and `0xE576516E`, to the variable `p1`. The expression `(0x60781BCD >= m ^ 4294967287UL)` is a logical XOR operation between the result of the comparison `0x60781BCD >= m` and the value `4294967287UL`.\n\n6. The program checks the value of the variable `i` using an `if` statement. If `i` is non-zero, it calls `printf` with the argument `0`.\n\n7. The function `fn3` returns the value of `p1`.\n\n8. The program defines the `main` function, which has no parameters.\n\n9. The `main` function calls the `fn3` function with the argument `1` and checks the returned value using an `if` statement. If the returned value is non-zero, an empty statement `;` is executed.\n\nTo substitute the redundant data type, we need to identify the data type defined by the programmer using typedef.

The program defines a function named `fn3` that takes a single parameter, but the data type of the parameter is not explicitly specified.\n\n4. Inside the `fn3` function, a `short` variable `m` is declared and initialized with the value `0x809C`.\n\n5. The `printf` function is called to print a formatted string. It uses the `%lld` format specifier, implying that the value to be printed is a `long long` integer. However, the value being passed is `(long long)0`, which is a type cast of `0` to `long long` data type. This can be considered redundant because `0` can be directly passed as an argument without the cast.\n\n6. The `fn2` function is called with two arguments: `(0x60781BCD >= m ^ 4294967287UL)` and `0xE576516E`. The first argument contains bitwise XOR and comparison operations, which are evaluated before being passed to `fn2`.\n\n7. After the `fn2` call, there is an `if` statement that checks the value of the `i` variable. However, the condition is not properly specified, as `printf(0)` is passed as the argument, which causes undefined behavior. It should be modified to `printf(\"%d\", i)` to print the value of `i`.\n\n8. The `fn3` function returns the modified `p1` value.\n\n9. The `main` function contains an `if` statement that calls the `fn3` function with argument `1`. However, the statement after the condition is empty, which means it doesn't perform any action.\n\nTo address the redundant data type, we need to identify the defined data type via typedef. In the given program, there are no typedef statements or custom-defined data types.
