The program defines a variable `i` of type `unsigned`.\n2. The program also defines a function `fn3()` that returns an `unsigned` value.\n3. Within the `fn3()` function, there is a call to `printf()` that prints a string and an integer value. The format specifier used is `%u`, which indicates an unsigned decimal integer.\n4. There is an `if` statement that checks the value of `i`. However, the variable `i` is not defined within the scope of the `fn3()` function. This appears to be an error.\n5. Inside the `if` statement, there is another call to `printf()` with an integer argument of `0`. This suggests an error since there is no corresponding format specifier in the format string.\n6. The function `fn3()` returns a value that results from an expression. The expression involves bitwise operators and arithmetic operations with hexadecimal and unsigned long values.\n7. The `main()` function declares a variable `p1` of type `unsigned` and initializes it with the return value of the `fn3()` function.\n\nTo identify and substitute the redundant data type, we can see that there is no explicit typedef or custom data type defined by the programmer in this program.
