The program then declares a function named \"fn1\" that takes two parameters: \"p1\" of type \"e\" (unsigned) and \"p2\" of type \"int\". The return type of the function is \"e\" (unsigned).\n\n3. Next, a struct named \"m\" is defined with two bit fields:\n   - \"n\" is a signed bit field with a width of 18 bits\n   - \"o\" is a signed bit field with a width of 1 bit\n\n4.
