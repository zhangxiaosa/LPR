Variable `s` is a static global variable and is initialized to -5L.\n2. Variable `ad` is a local variable of type `struct m` and is initialized with the value `{1957}`.\n3. Function `fn1` takes two arguments: `p1` of type `e` (typedef for `unsigned`) and `p2` of type `int`. It returns the value of `p2`.\n4. In `main()`, the variable `v` of type `g` (typedef for `unsigned`) is used as an argument along with the constant value `5` for the function call `fn1(v, 5)`. The return value is assigned to `ad.o`.\n5. Variables `ae` and `af` are declared as signed integers. `af` is initialized with the value of `t` which is of type `g` (typedef for `unsigned`).\n6. The value of `ad.o` is assigned to `ae`.\n7. The value of `u` is assigned to `ad.o`.\n8. The expression `af % (~s / ae)` is evaluated and the result is assigned to `r`. Here, `~s` represents the bitwise complement of `s`, and `ae` is used as the divisor.\n9.

The value of `ad.o` is assigned to `ae`, and subsequently, `ae` is used in the expression `af % (~s / ae)`.
