The program uses several typedef statements to define new data types:\n   - `typedef signed a;`\n   - `typedef int c;`\n   - `typedef long d;`\n   - `typedef unsigned e;`\n   - `typedef unsigned g;`\n\n2. We need to identify a redundant data type and substitute every instance of that data type with its associated original data type.\n\n3. Looking at the typedef statements, we can see that both `a` and `c` are defined as signed types. However, `c` is just an alias for the existing `int` type, so it can be considered redundant.\n\n4. We will replace every instance of `c` with `int` and remove the typedef declaration.\n\n5.
