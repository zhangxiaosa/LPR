The struct `c` has two members of type `a`: `d` and `e`. Since `a` is an alias for `int`, this struct declaration is equivalent to `struct c { int d; int e; };`.\n\n3. There is a variable declaration: `struct c f;`, which creates an instance of the struct `c` named `f`.\n\n4. The function `char fn1()` is defined. The first statement in the function is an if statement: `if (f.e) goto i;`. This condition checks the value of `f.e` and if it is nonzero, it jumps to the label `i`.\n\n5. The next statement is a function call to `fn1()`, which creates a recursive call to the same function.\n\n6. Following the function call, there is a variable declaration: `char j;` that declares a variable `j` of type `char`.\n\n7. The function returns the value of `j` using the `return` statement.\n\n8.
