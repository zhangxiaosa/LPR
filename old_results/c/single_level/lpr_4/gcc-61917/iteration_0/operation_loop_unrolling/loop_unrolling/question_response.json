Inside the `fn3` function, there is an infinite loop using a `for` loop with no termination condition (`for (;;)`). This loop is intended to run indefinitely.\n\n7. Inside the infinite loop, there is another `for` loop with a loop counter `l` initialized to 0 and a termination condition `l < 20`. This loop will execute 20 times.\n\n8. Within the second `for` loop, there is a nested `for` loop with a loop counter `k` initialized to 0 and a termination condition `k >= -27`.

Loop Unrolling:\n   Unrolling the outermost loop can simplify the loop structure and potentially improve performance. In this case, we'll unroll the outermost loop by a factor of 4.
