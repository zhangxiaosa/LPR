It loops indefinitely (`for (;;)`), and the loop termination condition is an `if` statement checking the value of `k`.\n\n2. Perform loop unrolling: As the loop in `fn2` has an indefinite number of iterations, we can unroll it by replacing the loop with its body multiple times. Since the loop body contains a `return` statement, we need to determine the number of loop iterations and generate the equivalent unrolled code.\n\n3. Determine the loop iterations: In this case, since the loop breaks when the condition `k` is true, we need to find the number of iterations until `k` becomes true. We can analyze the program to determine the loop iteration count.\n\n4. Generate the unrolled code: Based on the determined number of iterations, we can replace the loop with multiple copies of its body.
