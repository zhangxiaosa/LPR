The program declares a complex data type variable `h` of type `unsigned`.\n2. It defines a function `fn2` that takes a parameter `p1`. Inside the function, it assigns the value of `p1` to `h`.\n3.

The `unsigned` keyword is used to declare an integer type that can only represent non-negative values. The specific size of this type can vary depending on the compiler and platform, but it is typically 32 bits or 64 bits.\n\nTo decompose `h` into variables in primary data types, we can choose a primary data type that can represent non-negative integers of sufficient size.
