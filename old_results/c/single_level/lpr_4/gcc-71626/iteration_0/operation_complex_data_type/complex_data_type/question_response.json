Next, there is another typedef declaration: `typedef long d __attribute__((__vector_size__(sizeof(a))));`. This creates an alias `d` for the `long` data type with a vector attribute. The vector attribute indicates that the type `d` is a complex data type represented as a vector of `long` elements.\n\n4.

Inside this function:\n\n   - Variable `c` of type `a` (alias for `long`) is declared and initialized with the address of the function `fn1`. Since `fn1` is a function, its address can be assigned to a variable of type `a`.\n   \n   - Variable `f` of type `d` (alias for vector of `long`) is declared and initialized with the value of `c`.\n   \n   - The function returns `f`.\n   \n5.
