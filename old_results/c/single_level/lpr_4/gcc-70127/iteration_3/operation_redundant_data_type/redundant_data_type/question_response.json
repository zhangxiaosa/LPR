The program defines a typedef struct named `p`, which has two members: an integer `ab` and a signed bit field `q` with a width of 22 bits.\n2. The program declares an unsigned integer `u`.\n3. The program declares an array of `p` named `v` with a size of 1.\n4. The program declares a `p` variable `w` and initializes it with the values `{0x1C87E74FL, 816}`.\n5. The program declares an unsigned integer `j`.\n6. The program defines the `main` function.\n7. Inside `main`, an integer variable `i` is declared.\n8. A `p` variable `a` is declared and initialized with the values `{8L, 666}`.\n9. The program enters a `for` loop that iterates while `u` is less than or equal to 1. In each iteration, `a` is assigned the value of `v[0]`, which is assigned the value of `w`.\n10. After the `for` loop, another `for` loop is executed which iterates over the `v` array. In each iteration, the `q` member of `v[i]` is assigned to `j`.\n11. Finally, the program prints the value of `j` as a hexadecimal number using `printf`.\n\nThe redundant data type in this program is the typedef of the struct `p`. It is not necessary since `p` can be replaced with `struct` directly.
