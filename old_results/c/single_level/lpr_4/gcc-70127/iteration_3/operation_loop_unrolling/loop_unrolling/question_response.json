First loop optimization:\n   The first loop runs while `u` is less than or equal to 1. It increments `u` by 1 in each iteration.

We can optimize this loop by removing the unnecessary assignment statements. The loop can be modified as follows:\n   ```c\n   u = 2;\n   ```\n\n2. Second loop optimization:\n   The second loop iterates over `v` array with only one element. It assigns the value of `v[i].q` to `j` in each iteration.
