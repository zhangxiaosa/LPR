The program includes several functions: `fn1`, `fn2`, `fn3`, `fn4`, and `fn8`.\n2. The `main` function is the entry point of the program.\n3. The `fn8` function performs a loop, invoking other functions (`fn3`, `fn2`, and `fn4`), and returns a value.\n4. The `main` function initializes a variable `b`, calls `fn8` with some parameters, assigns the returned value to `p`, calls `fn1` with `p` and 0 as parameters, and finally returns `b`.\n5. The `fn1` function prints the value of `p` in hexadecimal format.\n6. The `fn2` function takes two parameters and returns the first parameter.\n7. The `fn3` function takes two parameters and returns the second parameter.\n8. The `fn4` function takes two parameters, adds them, and returns the result.\n\nTo optimize the program by inlining the `fn8` function, we can replace the function call with its body in the `main` function. The variable `v_3` should be replaced with the return value of `fn3` from within the loop.
