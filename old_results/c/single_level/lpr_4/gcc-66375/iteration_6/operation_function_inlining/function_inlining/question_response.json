The program has two functions, `fn1` and `fn2`, and a main function.\n2. The `fn1` function takes two parameters: `p1` of type unsigned and `p2` of type int. It uses `printf` to print the value of `p1` as a hexadecimal number.\n3. The `fn2` function takes two parameters: `p1` of type char and `p2` of type int. It simply returns the value of `p1`.\n4. The main function initializes a variable `d` with the value 2L (long).\n5. It has a loop that iterates while `u` is less than 51.\n6. Inside the loop, it assigns the value of `d` to `v_3`, calls the `fn2` function with `v_3` and 3 as arguments, and updates the value of `d` by adding `0x9EE7F9D1C772505B`.\n7.
