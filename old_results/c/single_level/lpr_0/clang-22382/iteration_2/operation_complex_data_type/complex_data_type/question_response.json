The `struct hjson` contains three variables of primary data types:\n   - `i` of type `signed int`\n   - `j` of type `long int`\n   - `k` of type `unsigned int`\n\n3. The program also declares an unsigned integer variable `l` outside any function:\n   ```c\n   unsigned l;\n   ```\n\n4. The program defines a static function `fn1` that takes five arguments and returns a `struct hjson`:\n   ```c\n   static struct hjson fn1(unsigned p1, short p2, unsigned p3, unsigned p4, struct hjson p5) {\n     p5.k;\n   w:\n     goto w;\n   }\n   ```\n\n5.
