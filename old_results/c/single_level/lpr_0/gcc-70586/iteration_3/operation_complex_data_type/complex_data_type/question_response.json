To decompose the variables of this data type into variables in primary data types, we need to analyze the function `fn3` and its parameters.\n\nThe function `fn3` takes a parameter `p1` of an unknown type. We can assume it as an `unsigned` data type since `fn3` is declared to return an `unsigned` value.\n\nInside the function `fn3`, the variable `p1` is reassigned with a complex expression `(0x60781BCDL >= 0x809C ^ 4294967287UL) - 0xE576516E`. This expression performs bitwise operations, comparison, and subtraction. However, as the final value of `p1` is assigned to `p1`, we can conclude that `p1` is an unsigned data type.\n\nThe variable `i` is referenced in the condition `if (i) printf(0);` inside the function `fn3`, but it's not defined within the function's scope.
