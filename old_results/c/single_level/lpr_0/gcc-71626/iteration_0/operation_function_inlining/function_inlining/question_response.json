It doesn't perform any actions, so it can be considered as a \"dummy\" function.\n3. Another typedef declaration defines `d` as a vector type with elements of type `a` and a size equal to the sizeof `a`.\n4. The function `fn2()` is defined. It returns a value of type `d` (the vector type defined earlier). Inside the function, it declares a variable `c` of type `a` and initializes it with the address of the `fn1` function. Then, it declares a variable `f` of type `d` and initializes it with the value of `c` (which is a single-element vector initialized with the address of `fn1`).
