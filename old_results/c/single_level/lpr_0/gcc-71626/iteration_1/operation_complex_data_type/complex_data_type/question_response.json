It declares `d` as a complex data type using `typedef` and the attribute `__vector_size__`. The `__vector_size__` attribute is used to indicate the size of the vector, which is determined by `sizeof a`.\n\nTo decompose the variables of the complex data type `d` into variables of primary data types, we need to understand what `d` represents. Based on the given program, `d` is likely representing a vector of `long` values.\n\nTo decompose `d` into variables in primary data types, we need to determine the size of the vector. Since the size of the vector is determined by `sizeof a`, we need to know the size of `a`.\n\nUnfortunately, the given program does not provide the definition for `a`, so we don't have enough information to determine the exact size of the vector and decompose it into primary data types.\n\nHowever, we can still modify the provided program to demonstrate the decomposition process. Let's assume `a` is an array of `long` values with a size of 4. Here's the modified program:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint fn1() {\n    return 42;\n}\n\ntypedef long d __attribute__((__vector_size__(sizeof(long) * 4)));\n\nd fn2() {\n    d f = {fn1(), fn1(), fn1(), fn1()};\n    return f;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    d result = fn2();\n    \n    for (int i = 0; i < sizeof(result) / sizeof(long); i++) {\n        printf(\"%ld\\n\", result[i]);\n    }\n    \n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nIn this modified program, the `d` type is decomposed into four variables of primary data type `long`. The `fn2` function initializes the `d` variable `f` with the return values of `fn1`, assuming `fn1` returns `long` values.
