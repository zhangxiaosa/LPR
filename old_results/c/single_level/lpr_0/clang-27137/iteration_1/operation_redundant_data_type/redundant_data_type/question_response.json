The program defines a function `fn1` that takes two parameters: an unsigned integer `p1` and an integer `p2`. Inside the function, it uses `printf` to print the value of `p1` in hexadecimal format.\n\n2. The program declares three global variables: an unsigned integer `h`, a short integer `o`, and a character `p`.\n\n3. The program defines a function `fn5` that returns a character. Inside the function, it declares a short integer `q` and an integer `i`. It also declares a short integer `r` and initializes it with the value of the global variable `o`. It assigns the value of `r` to `q`. Then, it enters a `for` loop that iterates 10 times. Inside the loop, there is a nested `while` loop that continues as long as `q` is greater than 1. In each iteration of the inner loop, it subtracts 1 from `q`. After the inner loop, there is an `if` statement that assigns the value of `q` to the global variable `p` and does nothing with the resulting value.\n\n4. The `main` function is defined as an integer function. Inside the function, it declares an integer `t` and initializes it with 0. Then, it calls the `fn5` function. It assigns the value of the global variable `p` to the global variable `h`. Finally, it calls the `fn1` function with the arguments `h` and `t`, and returns 0.\n\nBased on this analysis, the redundant data type in this program is the typedef for the character `p`.
