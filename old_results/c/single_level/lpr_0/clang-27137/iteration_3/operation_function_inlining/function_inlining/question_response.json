Replace the function call to fn5() in the main function with the code from fn5.\n4. Remove the if statement since it doesn't have any effect on the program.\n5. Remove the declaration of the variable p since it is unused and doesn't affect the program.\n6. Update the printf statement in the main function to print the value of q instead of p since p is no longer used.\n7.

This optimization is performed to eliminate the overhead of function calls and improve performance.\n\n3.
