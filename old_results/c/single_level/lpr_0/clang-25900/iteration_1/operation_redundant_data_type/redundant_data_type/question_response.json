The function simply returns the value of `p2`.\n   \n2. Next, there is a struct definition:\n   \n   ```c\n   struct m {\n       signed n : 18;\n       signed o : 1;\n   };\n   ```\n   \n   This struct defines a type `m` with two bit fields: `n` of type `signed int` with 18 bits and `o` of type `signed int` with 1 bit.\n\n3.
