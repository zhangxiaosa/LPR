The program declares three global variables: `int g` and `int h`. These are variables of primary data types.\n\n2. The program declares four function prototypes with different parameter types: `int fn1(unsigned short, unsigned, unsigned short)`, `unsigned short fn2(signed, unsigned short, unsigned)`, `short fn3(signed, signed, signed, unsigned short, int)`, and `int fn5()`.\n\n3. `fn5` is a function that returns an `int` value. It has two local variables: `int n` initialized with the value `1L` (long integer) and `unsigned o` initialized with the value `0x5A683F60L` (long integer). It calls `fn1` with the arguments `n`, `g`, `g`, and then returns the value of `o`.\n\n4. `fn1` is a function that returns an `int` value. It has three parameters: `unsigned short p1`, `unsigned p2`, and `unsigned short p3`. It has a local variable `int s` initialized with the value `0x57638FF4L` (long integer). It calls `fn2` with the arguments `g`, `s`, `g`, and then returns the value `1L` (long integer).\n\n5. `fn2` is a function that returns an `unsigned short` value. It has three parameters: `signed p1`, `unsigned short p2`, and `unsigned p3`. It has a local variable `unsigned u` initialized with the value `0x30A04A8FL` (long integer). It checks the result of calling `fn3` with arguments `0x9A5DL` (long integer), `g`, `p2`, `u`, and `p1`. If the result is true, it returns `0`; otherwise, it returns `0`.\n\n6. `fn3` is a function that returns a `short` value. It has five parameters: `signed p1`, `signed p2`, `signed p3`, `unsigned short p4`, and `int p5`. It has a local variable `signed ae` initialized with the value `0xA3L` (long integer). It also has an array `short ak[8]`. Inside nested loops, it performs some conditional checks and eventually returns the value of `ae`.\n\n7.
