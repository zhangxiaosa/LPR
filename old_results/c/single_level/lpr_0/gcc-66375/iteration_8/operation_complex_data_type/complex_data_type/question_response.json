The program contains three function definitions:\n   a. `char fn2(char p1, int p2)`\n   b. `int fn3(int p1, int p2)`\n   c. `int fn4(int p1, int p2)`\n\n   These functions take arguments of different data types and return respective values.\n\n2. The program declares two global variables:\n   a. `int u`\n   b. `int v_00`\n\n3. The `main` function starts with the declaration and initialization of a local variable `int d` with the value `2L`.\n\n4. Then, there is a `for` loop that iterates until the value of `u` is less than `51`. Inside the loop:\n   a. `v_00` is assigned the value returned by `fn3(4L, d)`.\n   b. The value of `v_00` is passed as an argument to `fn2` alongside `3`, and the result is assigned to `temp2`.\n   c. The value of `temp2` and a large hexadecimal constant are passed as arguments to `fn4`, and the result is assigned to `d`.\n\n5. After the loop, the program uses `printf` to print the value of `v_00` as the checksum in hexadecimal format.\n\nBased on the analysis, the complex data type in the given program is not explicitly present.
