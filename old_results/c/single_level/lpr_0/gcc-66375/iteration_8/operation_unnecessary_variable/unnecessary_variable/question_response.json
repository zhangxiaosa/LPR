The unused variable `temp2` is assigned the value of `fn2(v_00 = fn3(4L, d), 3)`.\n2. The return value of `fn3(4L, d)` is assigned to `v_00`.\n3. `temp2` is assigned the value of `fn2(v_00, 3)` which is `v_00` itself since `fn2` returns its first argument.\n4. The value of `temp2` is passed as an argument to `fn4` along with a constant value.\n5. The result of `fn4(temp2, 0x9EE7F9D1C772505BLL)` is assigned to `d`.\n6. The loop continues until `u` is less than 51.\n7. After the loop, the value of `v_00` is printed as hexadecimal checksum.\n\nOptimization:\n\nSince `temp2` is assigned the value of `v_00` and directly used as an argument to `fn4`, we can eliminate `temp2` and directly pass `v_00` as an argument to `fn4`.

The variable `temp2` is assigned the value of `fn2(v_00 = fn3(4L, d), 3)`. \n   - We can propagate the constant values as follows:\n     - `v_00 = fn3(4L, d)` is equivalent to `v_00 = d` (since `fn3` returns `p2`)\n     - `fn2(v_00, 3)` is equivalent to `v_00` (since `fn2` returns `p1`)\n   - Therefore, `temp2` can be replaced with `v_00`.\n2. The variable `d` is assigned the value of `fn4(temp2, 0x9EE7F9D1C772505BLL)`. \n   - Since we replaced `temp2` with `v_00` in the previous step, the assignment becomes `d = fn4(v_00, 0x9EE7F9D1C772505BLL)`.\n   - As `fn4` adds `p1` and `p2`, we can evaluate the constant expression and replace it with the result.
