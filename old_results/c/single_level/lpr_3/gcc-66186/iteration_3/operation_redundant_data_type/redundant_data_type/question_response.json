The program begins by declaring two variables `g` and `h` of type `int`.\n\n2. It defines a function `fn4` that takes five parameters:\n   - `p1` of type `int`\n   - `p2` of type `unsigned short`\n   - `p3` of type `unsigned short`\n   - `p4` of type `unsigned`\n   - `p5` of type `unsigned short`\n   The return type of the function is `unsigned`.\n\n3. Next, there is a function `fn5` that has no parameters and returns an `int`. It contains an `if` statement that calls the function `fn4` with specific arguments and performs an empty statement if the condition is true. It then returns a hexadecimal value `0x5A683F60L`.\n\n4. The function `fn4` is defined with the previously mentioned parameters. It declares a local array `ak` of type `short`. It contains nested loops that manipulate the parameters and perform some conditional checks. The function returns the value of the global variable `g`.\n\n5. Finally, the `main` function is defined, which has no parameters and returns an `int`. It calls the function `fn5`.\n\nBased on the program, there is no redundant data type defined by the programmer via `typedef`. \n\nThe final modified program with the substitution of the redundant data type would remain the same as the original program.
