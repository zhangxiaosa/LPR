Identify unused variables or variables that can be optimized:\n   - Unused variables: None (all variables appear to be used).\n   - Variables that can be optimized: The variable `n` in the `fn3()` function is not modified and its value is returned. Therefore, it can be optimized out.\n\n2. Apply the optimization technique (constant propagation or copy propagation):\n   - Constant Propagation: If a variable is assigned a constant value and that value is never modified, we can replace all occurrences of the variable with the constant value.\n   - Copy Propagation: If a variable is assigned the value of another variable and it is not modified afterwards, we can replace all occurrences of the variable with the value it was assigned.\n\n3. Perform the optimization:\n   - Since `n` is not modified and its value is returned directly, we can optimize it out using copy propagation.
