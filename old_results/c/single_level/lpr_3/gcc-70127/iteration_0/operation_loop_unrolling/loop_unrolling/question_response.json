Since `p2` is decremented by 1 in each iteration, and the termination condition is fixed (`p2 >= 0`), we can unroll this loop. In this case, we can unroll it twice to handle the possible values of `p2` (0 and -1).\n2. The loop in the `main` function: This loop iterates from 0 to 0, which means it only has one iteration. Therefore, we can unroll it as well.\n\nUnrolling the outer loop in `fn5` twice means replicating its body twice, each time with a different value for `p2` (0 and -1).\n\nFinal optimized program:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"program\": \"typedef signed a;\\n\n             typedef int c;\\n\n             typedef unsigned d;\\n\n             typedef unsigned e;\\n\n             typedef unsigned f;\\n\n             typedef unsigned g;\\n\\n\n             void fn1(f p1, int p2) {\\n\n               printf(\\\"checksum = %X\\\\n\\\", p1);\\n\n             }\\n\\n\n             f j;\\n\\n\n             void fn2(p1) {\\n\n               j = p1;\\n\n             }\\n\\n\n             void fn3(p1) {\\n\n               fn2(p1);\\n\n             }\\n\\n\n             void fn4(g p1, char *p2, int p3) {\\n\n               fn3(p1);\\n\n             }\\n\\n\n             struct p {\\n\n               c ab;\\n\n               signed q : 22;\\n\n             };\\n\\n\n             struct r {\\n\n               unsigned ab;\\n\n               unsigned s;\\n\n             };\\n\\n\n             struct r t;\\n\n             f u;\\n\n             struct p v[1];\\n\n             struct p w = {0x1C87E74FL, 816};\\n\\n\n             d fn5(e p1, a p2, d p3, f p4, f p5) {\\n\n               struct p a = {8L, 666};\\n\n               a = v[0] = w;\\n\n               v[0] = a;\\n\n               a = v[-1] = w;\\n\n               v[-1] = a;\\n\n             }\\n\\n\n             int main() {\\n\n               int i;\\n\n               int b = 0;\\n\n               fn5(t.ab, 3, 2, t.s, 9);\\n\n               fn4(v[0].q, \\\"g_217[i].f1\\\", b);\\n\n               fn4(v[-1].q, \\\"g_217[i].f1\\\", b);\\n\n               fn1(j, b);\\n\n               return 0;\\n\n             }\\n\"\n}\n```\n\nThe optimized program unrolls the outer loop in `fn5` twice, resulting in duplicated lines of code.
