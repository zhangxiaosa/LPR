The program starts with the declaration of various functions: `fn1`, `fn2`, `fn3`, `fn4`, `fn5`, `fn6`, `fn9`, `fn10`, `fn11`, `fn12`, and `fn13`.\n2. It also declares several global variables: `p`, `t`, `u`, `v`, `w`, `ab`, and `ac`.\n3. The function `fn13` is defined, which initializes a local variable `ae` and then calls the function `fn10` with arguments `u` and `t`. Finally, it returns `ae`.\n4. The function `fn10` is defined and takes two arguments: `p1` and `p2`. It initializes a local variable `ag` and then calls the function `fn11` with arguments `2L`, `ag`, `p2`, and `1`. It returns a hardcoded value `0x2F2F6D26L`.\n5. The function `fn11` is defined and takes four arguments: `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `p4`. It initializes local variables `ai` and `aj` and then calls the function `fn12` with arguments `ai`, `ai`, `p1`, `0`, and `p1`. Finally, it returns `aj`.\n6. The function `fn12` is defined and takes five arguments: `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `p4`, and `p5`. It initializes local variables `al`, `am`, and `an`. Then, it enters a loop where the variable `w` is iterated from `3` to `1` in a descending order. Inside the loop, there is an `if` statement that assigns `an` a value `250UL`. Further, it assigns a value to `p2` based on a logical OR operation involving the function `fn5` with arguments `ab` and `ac`, and a comparison between `an` and a hardcoded value `0x294A85636008822DLL`. Inside the `if` block, it declares a local variable `ao` and has another `if` statement that calls the functions `fn3` and `fn4` and performs a bitwise AND operation with `1UL`. Finally, it assigns a value to the global variable `v`. The function `fn12` returns `al`.\n7. The `main` function is defined. It declares a local variable `ap` and then calls the function `fn13` without using its return value. Next, it calls the function `fn9` with arguments `v`, a string literal `\"g_170\"`, and `ap`. Finally, it calls the function `fn1` with arguments `p` and `ap`, and returns `0`.\n\nThe redundant data type is `short` with the typedef `unsigned char`.
