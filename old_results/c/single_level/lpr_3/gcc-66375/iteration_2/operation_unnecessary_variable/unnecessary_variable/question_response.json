Analysis:\n   - The program declares several global variables `p`, `t`, `u`, and `v`.\n   - There are various function declarations and definitions: `fn2`, `fn3`, `fn4`, `fn5`, `fn7`, `fn8`, `fn9`, `fn10`, and `fn11`.\n   - Function `fn11` initializes variables `a` and `b` and calls `fn8` before returning `b`.\n   - Function `fn8` calls `fn9` and returns `p1`.\n   - Function `fn9` calls `fn10` and returns `p2`.\n   - Function `fn10` initializes variable `d` and contains nested loops that perform calculations and assignments to `d`.\n   - The `main` function initializes variables `i`, `j`, and `f`, calls `fn11`, and then calls `fn7` within nested loops.\n   - Finally, the value of global variable `p` is printed using `printf`.\n\n2. Optimization:\n   - There is an unused variable `p3` in the `fn9` function. We can optimize it out by removing the parameter and updating the function body accordingly.\n\n3.

The variable `t` is declared but not initialized or used in the main function, so it can be optimized out.\n\n2. The variable `u` is declared but not initialized or used outside of the fn10 function. Since it is not used within fn10, it can be optimized out.\n\n3. The variable `p` is declared as a global variable and assigned a value in the fn5 function. It is used in the printf statement at the end of the main function, so it cannot be optimized out.\n\n4. The variable `v` is declared as a 1x4 array but not initialized or used outside of the fn10 and main functions. Since it is not used within fn10, it can be optimized out.\n\n5. The variable `f` is declared and initialized as 0 in the main function but not used outside of the nested for loop. Since it is not used within the loop, it can be optimized out.\n\n6. The variables `i` and `j` are declared and initialized in the main function but only used within the nested for loop. Since their values are not needed outside of the loop, they can be optimized out.\n\n7. The variable `a` is declared and initialized in the fn11 function but not used outside of the fn8 function.
