The program starts with function declarations for `fn2`, `fn3`, `fn4`, `fn5`, `fn6`, `fn7`, `fn8`, `fn9`, `fn10`, and `fn11`.\n\n2. After the function declarations, several global variables are defined: `p`, `t`, `u`, and `v`.\n\n3. The `fn11` function is defined. It initializes variables `a` and `b` and then calls `fn8` with `t` and `a` as arguments. Finally, it returns `b`.\n\n4. The `fn8` function is defined.

Finally, it prints the value of global variable `p` using `printf` and returns `0`.\n\nFrom the analysis, it appears that the global variable `p` is not used except for printing its value at the end of the program.
