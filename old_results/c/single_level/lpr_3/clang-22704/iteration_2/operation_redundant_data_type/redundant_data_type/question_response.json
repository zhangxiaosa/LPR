The program declares two variables `d` and `e` of type `int`.\n2. It defines a function `fn1` that returns a `char`.\n3. Inside the `fn1` function, there is an `if` condition checking the value of `e`.\n4. If `e` is true (non-zero), it jumps to a label `i`.\n5. If `e` is false (zero), it recursively calls `fn1` again.\n6. After the recursive call, it returns an `unsigned long` value `0xEEACFBBFL`.\n7. The label `i` assigns the value `6L` to the variable `d`.\n8. After the assignment, it again recursively calls `fn1`.\n9. Finally, it returns the same `unsigned long` value `0xEEACFBBFL`.\n10. The `main` function is empty.\n\nTo identify the redundant data type, we need to look for any typedef statement that defines a new data type. However, in the given code, there is no typedef or any user-defined data type. So, there is no redundant data type to substitute.\n\nThe program with the substituted data type would be the same as the original program.

It is not a data type defined by the programmer via `typedef`, so it is not a redundant data type.\n\n6. The function `fn1` calls itself recursively. The return statement in the recursive call returns an integer literal `0xEEACFBBFL`, which is a long integer literal. It is not a redundant data type.\n\n7. The program ends with the `main` function, which has a return type of `int`.
