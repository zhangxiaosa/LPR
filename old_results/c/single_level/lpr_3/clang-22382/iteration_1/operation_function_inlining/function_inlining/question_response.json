There is a struct `h` that has three members: `i` of type `signed int`, `j` of type `c` (i.e., `long`), and `k` of type `unsigned`.\n3. The program includes a static function `fn1` that takes four arguments: `p1` of type `f` (`unsigned`), `p3` of type `g` (`unsigned`), `p4` of type `d` (`unsigned`), and `p5` of type `struct h`. This function does nothing meaningful besides accessing `p5.k` and having an infinite loop using a `goto` statement.\n4. There is a function `fn2` that returns a value of type `e` (`unsigned`). It takes a single argument `p1` of type `unsigned`. Within this function, a variable `p` of type `struct h` is declared, along with `q` of type `b` (`int`). Then, `fn1` is called passing `q`, `p1`, the value `3`, and `p` as arguments. After that, an infinite loop is created using a `for` statement.
