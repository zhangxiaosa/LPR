Next, there's a definition of a struct named h, which has the following members:\n   - i, which is of type signed.\n   - j, which is of type c (long).\n   - k, which is of type unsigned.\n\n3. Following the struct definition, there's a declaration of a variable named l, which has type d (unsigned).\n\n4.
