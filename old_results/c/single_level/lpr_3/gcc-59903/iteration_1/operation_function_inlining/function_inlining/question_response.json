The function `fn2` is being called in the `if` condition of the `fn3` function: `if (fn2(p1, r, s, q[0][0]), p1)`. So, we can inline the body of `fn2` into `fn3` at that location.\n2. Copy the entire body of the `fn2` function into the `if` block of `fn3` where `fn2` is being called.\n3. Replace the function call `fn2(p1, r, s, q[0][0])` with the copied code from `fn2`.\n4.

The program defines a struct `i` with three members `j`, `k`, and `l`.\n2. It declares an array `m` of size 4 of unsigned integers.\n3. It declares an array `n` of size 2 of `struct i`.\n4. It defines a function `fn1` that takes an unsigned integer `p1` and an integer `p2` as arguments. It returns the maximum value between `p1` and `p1` shifted left by `p2` bits.\n5. It defines a function `fn2` that takes an integer `p1`, a `struct i` `p2`, an unsigned integer `p3`, and a short integer `p4` as arguments. It returns a `struct i`.\n6. Inside `fn2`, it declares a local variable `v` of `struct i` type and initializes it with the values `{0x15L, -5L}`.\n7. It declares two integer variables `w` and `a` inside `fn2`.\n8. It checks if `p4` XOR `v.k` is non-zero. If it is non-zero, it does nothing. Otherwise, it assigns `n[1]` to `v`.\n9. It enters a loop that continues as long as `w` is non-zero. In each iteration of the loop, it goes through three nested loops:\n   - The first loop iterates `p3` from 0 to 39.\n   - The second loop iterates `p2.j` from 0 to 2.\n   - Inside the nested loops, it assigns `v` to `n[0]` and assigns `m[p2.j]` to `v.l`.\n   - It declares a local `struct i` variable `b` inside an if-else statement.\n   - It checks if `n[0].j` is zero.
