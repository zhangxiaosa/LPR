The program starts with three typedef statements:\n   - typedef char a;\n   - typedef int b;\n   - typedef unsigned c;\n\n2. The typedef statements define new names for existing data types:\n   - The data type defined by \"typedef char a;\" is called \"a\" and it is equivalent to the data type \"char\".\n   - The data type defined by \"typedef int b;\" is called \"b\" and it is equivalent to the data type \"int\".\n   - The data type defined by \"typedef unsigned c;\" is called \"c\" and it is equivalent to the data type \"unsigned\".\n\n3. The program defines a function \"fn1\" that takes two parameters of type \"a\" (which is equivalent to \"char\") and returns a value of type \"a\". The function multiplies the two input parameters and returns the result.\n\n4. The program defines a structure \"g\" that has a member named \"h\" of type \"signed\". The \"signed\" keyword is redundant here, as it is the default sign for integer types.\n\n5. The program declares a variable \"i\" of type \"b\" (which is equivalent to \"int\").\n\n6. The program declares a variable \"j\" of type \"g\" (which is a structure).\n\n7. The program defines a function \"fn2\" that takes three parameters: \"p1\" of type \"c\" (which is equivalent to \"unsigned\"), \"p2\" of type pointer to \"b\" (which is equivalent to pointer to \"int\"), and \"p3\" of type \"a\" (which is equivalent to \"char\"). The function uses a loop to iterate over the values of \"p3\" and performs bitwise XOR operation with the result of calling function \"fn1\" with \"p3\" and \"i\" as arguments. The function then returns the value of \"p2\".\n\n8.

Next, a function named \"fn1\" is defined with two parameters of type \"a\" and a return type of \"a\". The function multiplies the two parameters and returns the result.\n\n3. Then, a structure is defined named \"g\" with a member variable \"h\" of type \"signed int\".\n\n4. Two variables are declared:\n   - Variable \"i\" of type \"b\" (int)\n   - Variable \"j\" of type \"struct g\"\n\n5. A function named \"fn2\" is defined with three parameters: \"p1\" of type \"c\" (unsigned), \"p2\" as a pointer to \"b\" (int), and \"p3\" of type \"a\" (char). The function performs some calculations involving the variables \"p3\", \"i\", and \"j\".\n\n6. Inside the \"fn2\" function, there is a loop that iterates while \"p3\" is greater than -9. It subtracts 2 from \"p3\" in each iteration and performs a bitwise XOR operation on \"j.h\" with the result of calling the function \"fn1\" with \"p3\" and \"i\" as arguments, and the constant 1L.\n\n7. The \"fn2\" function returns the pointer \"p2\".\n\n8. Finally, the \"main\" function is defined as an integer function that returns 0.\n\nBased on the analysis, there is no redundant data type defined by the programmer via typedef in the given program.

The program declares a function `fn1` that takes two parameters of type `a` and returns a value of type `a`. The function multiplies the two parameters and returns the result.\n\n3.

The function iterates over a loop with an initial value of `6` for `p3` and decrements it by `2` until it reaches `-9`. Within the loop, it performs a bitwise XOR operation on `j.h` and the result of calling the `fn1` function with arguments `p3` and `i`, and `1L`. The loop does not affect the program's behavior as `p2` is returned without modification at the end of the function.\n\n7. The program includes a `main` function that returns `0`. This function serves as the entry point of the program.\n\nTo substitute the redundant data types with their associated original data types, we need to replace every occurrence of `a` with `char`, `b` with `int`, and `c` with `unsigned`.\n\nHere's the modified program:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"program\": \"typedef char a;\\ntypedef int b;\\ntypedef unsigned c;\\nchar fn1(char p1, char p2) { return p1 * p2; }\\nstruct g {\\n  signed h;\\n};\\nint i;\\nstruct g j;\\nint *fn2(unsigned p1, int *p2, char p3) {\\n  for (p3 = 6; p3 > -9; p3 -= 2)\\n    j.h ^= fn1(p3, i) && 1L;\\n  return p2;\\n}\\nint main() { return 0; }\"\n}\n```\n\nNote: The modified program is in a JSON format, wrapped in Markdown syntax.
