Following the struct definition, there's a variable `l` of type `d`:\n   ```c\n   d l;\n   ```\n   Since `d` is a typedef for `unsigned`, `l` is of type `unsigned`.\n\n4.

Then, the function `fn1` is called with arguments `q` (of type `int`), `l` (of type `unsigned`), `p1` (of type `e`), `3` (of type `int`), and `p` (of type `struct h`).\n\n6.
