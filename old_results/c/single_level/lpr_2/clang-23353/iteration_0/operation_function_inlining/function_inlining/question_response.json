After the function definition, a structure named `g` is declared, which contains a single member `h` of type `signed int`.\n\n4.

It takes three parameters:\n   - `p1` of type `c` (unsigned)\n   - `p2` of type `b*` (pointer to int)\n   - `p3` of type `a` (char)\n\n6. Inside the function `fn2()`, a for loop is used, initializing `p3` to 6 and continuing until `p3` is not equal to -7.
