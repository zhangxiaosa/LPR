The `fn2` function takes two unsigned integers `p1` and `p2` as parameters and returns the difference between them.\n2. The program declares the `i` variable as an unsigned integer.\n3. The `fn3` function takes one parameter `p1` and returns an unsigned integer.\n4. Inside the `fn3` function, there are several statements:\n   a. Declares the `l` variable as an integer.\n   b. Assigns the integer value `0x809C` to the `m` variable.\n   c. Assigns the unsigned integer value `0xE576516E` to the `o_0` variable.\n   d. Checks if the `i` variable is nonzero and prints the value of the `l` variable as a long long integer using `printf` function.\n   e. Calls the `fn2` function with the parameters `0x60781BCD >= m ^ 4294967287UL` and `o_0`, and assigns the result to the `p1` variable.\n   f. Checks if the `i` variable is nonzero and prints the value of the `l` variable as a long long integer using `printf` function.\n   g. Returns the value of the `p1` variable.\n5. The `main` function does the following:\n   a. Calls the `fn3` function with the parameter `1`.\n   b. Checks if the return value of the `fn3` function is nonzero (effectively does nothing).\n\nOptimization Goal: Loop Unrolling\n\nTo optimize the program by loop unrolling, we need to identify loops in the program.
