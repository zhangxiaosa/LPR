The next statement is `unsigned p = g;`, which initializes the variable `p` with the value of the global variable `g`.\n6. There is a label `q` followed by a statement `k = k >> 1;`, which right-shifts the value of `k` by 1 bit.\n7. The statement `i = p;` assigns the value of `p` to `i`.\n8. An `if` statement checks if `i` is nonzero. If it is, the program enters the `if` block. Otherwise, it continues to the end of the function.\n9.
