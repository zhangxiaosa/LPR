Declare a variable `t` of type `struct r`.\n4. Declare an `unsigned` variable `u`.\n5. Declare an array `v` of size 1, where each element is of type `struct p`.\n6. Declare a variable `w` of type `struct p` and initialize it with the values `{0x1C87E74FL, 816}`.\n7. Define a function `fn5` that takes five arguments: `p1` of type `unsigned`, `p2` of type `int`, `p3` of type `unsigned`, `p4` of type `unsigned`, and `p5` of type `unsigned`.\n8. Inside `fn5`, declare a variable `a` of type `struct p` and initialize it with the values `{8L, 666}`.\n9. Start a nested loop with `p2` ranging from 0 to 1.\n10. Within the nested loop, start another loop while `u` is less than or equal to 1.\n11. Assign `w` to `a` and assign `a` to `v[p2]`.\n12. Assign `a` to `v[p2]`.\n13.
