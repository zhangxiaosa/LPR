It returns a value of type `int`.\n- `e fn2(signed, e, f);` - `fn2` is a function that takes three arguments: `signed` (of type `int`), `e` (of type `unsigned short`), and `f` (of type `unsigned`). It returns a value of type `unsigned short`.\n- `f fn4(c, e, e, f, e);` - `fn4` is a function that takes five arguments: `c` (of type `int`), `e` (of type `unsigned short`), `e` (of type `unsigned short`), `f` (of type `unsigned`), and `e` (of type `unsigned short`). It returns a value of type `unsigned`.\n- `c fn5()` - `fn5` is a function that takes no arguments and returns a value of type `int`. It declares and initializes two local variables: `n` of type `int` and `o` of type `unsigned`. It invokes the `fn1` function and returns the value of `o`.\n- `c fn1(e p1, d p2, e p3)` - `fn1` is a function that takes three arguments: `p1` of type `unsigned short`, `p2` of type `unsigned`, and `p3` of type `unsigned short`. It declares and initializes two local variables: `s` of type `int` and `t` of type `int`. It invokes the `fn2` function and returns the value of `t`.\n- `e fn2(signed p1, e p2, f p3)` - `fn2` is a function that takes three arguments: `p1` of type `int`, `p2` of type `unsigned short`, and `p3` of type `unsigned`. It declares and initializes a local variable `ad` of type `int`. It checks a condition and returns `0`.\n- `f fn4(c p1, e p2, e p3, f p4, e p5)` - `fn4` is a function that takes five arguments: `p1` of type `int`, `p2` of type `unsigned short`, `p3` of type `unsigned short`, `p4` of type `unsigned`, and `p5` of type `unsigned short`. It declares an array `ak` of type `short` with a length of 8. It contains nested loops and a conditional statement, but it returns the value of `g`.\n- `int main()` - `main` is the main function of the program. It takes no arguments and returns an `int`.
