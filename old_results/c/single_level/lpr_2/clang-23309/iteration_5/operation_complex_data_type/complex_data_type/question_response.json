The complex data type present in the program is a structure. However, we don't have any structure definitions in the given code.\n\n2. Variables in primary data types:\n   - `unsigned p;` (unsigned integer)\n   - `unsigned t;` (unsigned integer)\n   - `unsigned u;` (unsigned integer)\n   - `long v;` (long integer)\n   - `short w;` (short integer)\n\n3. The function `void fn7(p1)` assigns the value of the parameter `p1` to the global variable `p`. As the parameter `p1` is not explicitly declared with a data type, we can assume it to be an integer.\n\n4. The function `short fn12(int p1, int p2, unsigned p3, short p4, unsigned p5)` contains the following variables:\n   - `int al = 3L;` (long integer assigned to an integer variable)\n   - `long am = 1L;` (long integer assigned to a long integer variable)\n   - `int an;` (integer)\n\n5. Inside the `for` loop in `fn12`, we have the following assignment:\n   - `w = 3;` (integer assigned to a short integer)\n\n6. The conditional statement `if (an = 250UL)` assigns an unsigned long integer value to the integer variable `an`.\n\n7. Inside the conditional statement, we have the following assignments:\n   - `p2 = p1 || (an = w) == 0x294A85636008822DLL;` (integer assigned to an integer variable)\n   - `short ao = 0xBCD1L;` (long integer assigned to a short integer)\n\n8. The function `unsigned fn10(unsigned p1, short p2)` assigns the value returned by `fn12` to the variable `ai`, which is a long integer.\n\nBased on the analysis, we have identified the complex data type as a structure, but there are no structure definitions in the given code.
