The program defines several functions with different return types and parameter types: fn1, fn2, fn3, fn4, fn6, fn7, fn12, and fn10. These functions are of complex data types.\n\n2. Now, let's decompose the variables in these complex data types into variables in primary data types:\n   - fn1(unsigned p1, int p2):\n     - p1 is an unsigned int\n     - p2 is an int\n     \n   - fn2(int p1, int p2):\n     - p1 is an int\n     - p2 is an int\n     \n   - fn3(long p1, long p2):\n     - p1 is a long\n     - p2 is a long\n     \n   - fn4(unsigned p1, unsigned p2):\n     - p1 is an unsigned int\n     - p2 is an unsigned int\n     \n   - fn6(unsigned p1, unsigned p2):\n     - p1 is an unsigned int\n     - p2 is an unsigned int\n     \n   - fn7(p1):\n     - p1 is of unknown data type (missing type specifier).\n\n   - fn12(int p1, int p2, unsigned p3, short p4, unsigned p5):\n     - p1 is an int\n     - p2 is an int\n     - p3 is an unsigned int\n     - p4 is a short\n     - p5 is an unsigned int\n\n3. The program also defines the following variables:\n   - unsigned p\n   - unsigned t\n   - unsigned u\n   - long v\n   - short w\n\n4.
