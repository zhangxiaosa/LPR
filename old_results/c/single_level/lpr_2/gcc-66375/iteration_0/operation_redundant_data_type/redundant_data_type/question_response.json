In the `fn10` function, there's a loop that initializes an array `e` and performs substitutions inside the loop body:\n   - `g e[9];` - No substitution required as `g` is already an original data type.\n   - `d = fn4(fn2(v[0][3] = fn3(4L, d), 3), e[0]);` - `d`, `v`, and `e` are already original data types, no substitutions required.\n\n6. The `main` function initializes variables `i`, `j`, and `f`, and calls other functions:\n   - `fn11();` - No substitution required as `fn11` already has the correct data types.\n   - Loops with substitutions:\n     - `fn7(v[i][j], \"g_1729[i][j]\", f);` - No substitution required as `v`, `i`, `j`, and `f` are already original data types.\n     - `fn1(p, f);` - `p` needs to be replaced with `unsigned` (original data type).\n\n7. The program ends with `return 0;`.\n\nHere's the modified program with the redundant data type removed:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"program\": \"#include <stdio.h>\\n\\ntypedef short c;\\ntypedef int d;\\ntypedef unsigned e;\\ntypedef unsigned f;\\ntypedef unsigned g;\\n\\nvoid fn1(unsigned p1, int p2) { printf(\\\"checksum = %X\\\\n\\\", p1); }\\n\\nchar fn2(char p1, int p2) { return p1; }\\n\\nc fn3(c p1, c p2) { return p2; }\\n\\ng fn4(g p1, g p2) { return p1 + p2; }\\n\\nunsigned p;\\n\\nvoid fn5(p1) { p = p1; }\\n\\nvoid fn7(g p1, char *p2, int p3) { fn5(p1); }\\n\\nf t;\\ng u;\\n\\ng v[1][4];\\n\\ne fn8(char, d);\\ng fn9(f, f, d, g, d);\\nd fn10(d, e, f, d);\\nc fn11() {\\n  char a = 0xFBL;\\n  d b = 0L;\\n  fn8(t, a);\\n  return b;\\n}\\n\\ne fn8(char p1, d p2) {\\n  fn9(p2, p2, t, 18446744073709551613UL, t);\\n  return p1;\\n}\\n\\ng fn9(f p1, f p2, d p3, g p4, d p5) {\\n  e c = 255UL;\\n  fn10(6, c, 1, p1);\\n  return p2;\\n}\\nd fn10(d p1, e p2, f p3, d p4) {\\n  d d = 2L;\\n  for (; u < 51; ++u) {\\n    g e[9];\\n    int i;\\n    for (i = 0; i < 9; i++)\\n      e[i] = 0x9EE7F9D1C772505BLL;\\n    d = fn4(fn2(v[0][3] = fn3(4L, d), 3), e[0]);\\n  }\\n  return 3;\\n}\\n\\nint main() {\\n  int i, j;\\n  int f = 0;\\n  fn11();\\n  for (i = 0; i < 1; i++)\\n    for (j = 0; j < 4; j++)\\n      fn7(v[i][j], \\\"g_1729[i][j]\\\", f);\\n  fn1(p, f);\\n  return 0;\\n}\"\n}\n```"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1196, "completion_tokens": 6843, "total_tokens": 8039}, "system_fingerprint": null}
