The program declares several functions (`fn1`, `fn2`, `fn3`, `fn4`, and `fn11`), global variables (`p`, `u`, `v`), and local variables (`b`, `d`, `e`, `i`, `j`, and `f`).\n2. `fn1` is a void function that takes an `unsigned` integer `p1` and an `int` `p2` as parameters. It uses `printf` to print the value of `p1` in hexadecimal format.\n3. `fn2` is a function that takes a `char` `p1` and an `int` `p2` as parameters and returns `p1`.\n4. `fn3` is a function that takes two `short` integers `p1` and `p2` as parameters and returns `p2`.\n5. `fn4` is a function that takes two `unsigned` integers `p1` and `p2` as parameters and returns the sum of `p1` and `p2`.\n6. `fn11` is a `short` function that initializes `b` and `d` with `0L` and `2L` respectively. It then enters a loop that iterates while `u` is less than `51`. In each iteration, it declares an array `e` of 9 `unsigned` integers, sets the first element `e[0]` to the value `0x9EE7F9D1C772505BLL`, assigns the result of `fn3(4L, d)` to `v[0][3]`, and assigns the result of `fn4(fn2(v[0][3], 3), e[0])` to `d`.\n7. `main` is the entry point of the program. It declares local variables `i`, `j`, and `f` and initializes `f` with `0`. It then calls `fn11` and enters a nested loop. The outer loop iterates once (`i` goes from `0` to `0`), and the inner loop iterates four times (`j` goes from `0` to `3`). In each iteration, it assigns the value of `v[i][j]` to the global variable `p`.\n8. After the loop, it calls `fn1` with the values of `p` and `f` as arguments and returns `0`.\n\nThe redundant data type in this program is the `short` data type. It is defined by the programmer in the function signatures of `fn3` and `fn11`.
