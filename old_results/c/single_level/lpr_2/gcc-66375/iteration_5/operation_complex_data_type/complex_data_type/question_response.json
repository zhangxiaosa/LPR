The `main` function begins:\n   - It initializes the variable `d` with the value `2L`.\n   - It enters a `for` loop that continues until `u` is less than `51`.\n   - Inside the loop, an array `e` of size 9 is declared, with elements of type `unsigned`.\n   - The first element of `e` is assigned the value `0x9EE7F9D1C772505BLL`.\n   - The variable `v_03` is assigned the value of `d`.\n   - The function `fn4` is called with the arguments `fn2(v_03 = d, 3)` and `e[0]`.\n   - The return value of `fn4` is assigned to the variable `d`.\n   - The loop continues until `u` reaches `51`.\n\n4.
