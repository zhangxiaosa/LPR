The program then defines a function `fn1` which takes a parameter `p1` of type `d` (unsigned char) and `p2` of type `int`. It compares `p1` with `p2` and returns the larger value or the result of shifting `p1` by `p2` bits. The return type of the function is `d` (unsigned char).\n\n3.

An array `m` of size 4 is defined with elements of type `e` (unsigned integer), which was typedefed earlier.\n\n5. An array `n` of size 2 is defined with elements of type `struct i`. Each element is an instance of the `i` structure.\n\n6. The program defines another function `fn2` that takes four parameters: `p1` (int), `p2` (struct i), `p3` (e), and `p4` (short). The function returns a value of type `struct i`. Inside the function, a local variable `v` is declared as an instance of `i` structure and initialized with specific values.\n\n7.
