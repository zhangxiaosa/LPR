The program defines a function `fn1` that takes a `d` type parameter (`p1`) and an `int` type parameter (`p2`). It compares `p1` and `p2` and returns the larger value.\n   - In the return statement, the expression `p1 << p2` performs a bitwise left shift operation.\n\n3. The program defines a structure `i` that contains three members: `j` of type `a`, `k` of type `a`, and `l` of type `c`.\n\n4. The program declares an array `m` of size 4 with elements of type `e`.\n\n5. The program declares an array `n` of size 2 with elements of type `i`.\n\n6. The program declares a function `fn2` that takes four parameters: `p1` of type `c`, `p2` of type `i`, `p3` of type `e`, and `p4` of type `b`. It returns a value of type `i`.\n   - In the function definition, a local variable `v` of type `i` is declared and initialized with `{0x15L, -5L}`.\n   - The function also declares local variables `w`, `a`, and `b` of type `c`.\n   - The function contains nested for loops and conditional statements.\n\n7. The program defines a function `fn3` that takes a parameter `p1` of type `d` and returns a value of type `d`.\n   - The function declares local variables `q` of type `d`, `r` of type `i`, and `s` of type `e`.\n   - The function contains conditional statements and a return statement.\n\n8.
