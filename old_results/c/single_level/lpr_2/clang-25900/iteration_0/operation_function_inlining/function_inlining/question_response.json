The program declares a function `fn1` that takes an `e` and an `int` parameter and returns an `e`.\n3. The program defines two structs: `k` with a field `l` of type `f`, and `m` with two bit fields `n` and `o`.\n4.

The program declares functions `fn2` and `fn3` without providing their definitions. Their signatures indicate that `fn2` takes several parameters with different types and `fn3` takes a `g` parameter and returns a `b`.\n6. The program defines a function `fn4` that returns a `d` and doesn't take any parameters.
