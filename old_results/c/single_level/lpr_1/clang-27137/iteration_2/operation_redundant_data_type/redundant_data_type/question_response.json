The program defines three variables:\n   - `unsigned h` of type `unsigned int`\n   - `short o` of type `short`\n   - `int s` initialized with the value `1L`\n\n2. The program enters the `main()` function.\n\n3. Inside `main()`, a new variable `q` of type `short` is declared and initialized with the value of `o`.\n\n4. A `while` loop is initiated with the condition `q > s`. The loop subtracts `1` from `q` in each iteration.\n\n5. Steps 4 and 5 are repeated a total of six times, resulting in six iterations of the loop where `q` is reduced by `1` each time.\n\n6. Afterwards, the value of `q` is assigned to `h`.\n\n7. Finally, the program prints the value of `h` in hexadecimal format using the `printf` function.\n\n8. The program ends by returning `0` from the `main()` function.\n\nThe redundant data type in this program is the `short` data type defined by the programmer via the declaration of the variable `short o`. Since the `short` data type is already a built-in type, there is no need to redefine it.\n\nTo substitute every instance of the defined data type with its associated original data type, we need to replace `short` with `short int`.
