We'll inline this sequence of loops.\n\n2. Replace the function call: Remove the function call by replacing it with the sequence of statements inside the function.\n\n3. Remove the function definition: Since we are inlining the function, we can remove its definition.\n\n4. Modify the variable usage: Since the variable `q` is no longer defined within the inlined loop sequence, we need to modify its declaration and initialization.\n\n5.

The program then enters a loop where `q` is decremented by 1 repeatedly until it becomes less than or equal to 1.\n5. This loop runs six times, decrementing `q` by 1 each time.\n6.
