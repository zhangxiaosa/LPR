The `fn3` function takes two parameters of type `int` and returns a value of type `int`. It performs a complex logical expression and returns the result.\n5. The variables `m`, `n`, `o`, and `p` are declared but not initialized. They are of type `unsigned`, `unsigned`, `signed`, and `static unsigned` respectively.\n6. The `fn5` function takes a single parameter (`p1`) and returns a value of type `short`. It contains a `for` loop and various conditional statements.
