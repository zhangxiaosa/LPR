Identify the variables:\n   - unsigned g (global variable)\n   - int h2\n   - static unsigned i\n\n2. Analyze the code:\n   - The function `fn1` initializes a 3-dimensional array `int r[5][9][5]`.\n   - Inside the infinite loop, it checks the value of `h2`. If `h2` is non-zero, it returns `0xC3L`.\n   - Otherwise, it assigns `g` the value of `r[i][i][i]`.\n\n3. Optimization:\n   - The variable `i` is unused. It is only used to access `r[i][i][i]` in the assignment to `g`. Since `i` is a constant value, we can perform constant propagation to replace `i` with its value.\n   - We can also observe that `h2` is never modified in the loop. If `h2` is non-zero initially, the loop will never execute. We can perform constant propagation for `h2` as well.\n\n4.
