The program starts with the declaration of several variables:\n   - `int e;` - This is a primary data type variable of type `int`.\n   - `unsigned f;` - This is a primary data type variable of type `unsigned`.\n   - `unsigned g;` - This is a primary data type variable of type `unsigned`.\n   - `int h[] = {0x92A1D2CDL, 0x92A1D2CDL, 0x92A1D2CDL};` - This is an array of integers (`int`) named `h` with three elements initialized to hexadecimal values.\n   - `static unsigned i = 0x06D7L;` - This is a static variable of type `unsigned` named `i` initialized with a hexadecimal value.\n\n2. The program defines a function `fn1` which takes four parameters:\n   - `int m` - A primary data type parameter of type `int`.\n   - `unsigned n` - A primary data type parameter of type `unsigned`.\n   - `unsigned o` - A primary data type parameter of type `unsigned`.\n   - `signed p` - A primary data type parameter of type `signed`.\n\n3. Within the `fn1` function, there is an infinite loop created using the `for (;;)`. Inside the loop:\n   - `unsigned q = 0xC3L;` - This is a primary data type variable of type `unsigned` named `q` initialized with a hexadecimal value.\n   - `int r[5][9][5];` - This is a multi-dimensional array of integers (`int`) named `r`, with dimensions `[5][9][5]`.\n\n4. Inside the loop, there is an `if` condition:\n   - `if (h[2])` - This checks if the element at index 2 of array `h` is non-zero.\n\n5. If the condition in step 4 is true, the function returns the value of `q`, and the loop terminates.\n\n6. If the condition in step 4 is false, the value of `g` is assigned:\n   - `g = r[i][i][i];` - This assigns the value of `r[i][i][i]` to `g`, where `i` is the value of the static variable `i` declared earlier.\n\n7. The program defines the `main` function, which is the entry point of the program. Inside the `main` function, the `fn1` function is called with four arguments: `f, e, e, e`.\n\nBased on this analysis, the complex data type present in the program is the multi-dimensional array `int r[5][9][5]`.
