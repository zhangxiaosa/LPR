In the given program, there is no `typedef` statement present, so there are no redundant data types to substitute.\n\nHowever, we can identify some inconsistencies in the program. The variable `e` is declared but not initialized, and it is used as an argument in the function call `fn1(e)` without assigning it a value. Additionally, the function `fn1` is declared as returning a `signed` value but does not have a return type specified.\n\nTo fix these issues, we can assign a value to the variable `e` and specify the return type of the function `fn1` as `signed int`.

The redundant data type in the given program is the `signed` keyword used in the function declaration `signed fn1(p)`. The `signed` keyword is used as a modifier for the `int` data type, but `int` is already signed by default in C. Therefore, the `signed` keyword is redundant.\n\n2. To remove the redundant data type, we need to replace every instance of `signed fn1(p)` with `int fn1(p)`.\n\n3.
