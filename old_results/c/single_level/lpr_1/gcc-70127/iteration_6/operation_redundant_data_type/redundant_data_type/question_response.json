The program defines a data type `struct p` with two members: `ab` of type `int` and `q` of type `signed` bit-field with a width of 22 bits.\n2. The program also declares variables `u` of type `unsigned`, `v` as an array of `struct p` with size 1, and `w` of type `struct p` initialized with values {0x1C87E74FL, 816}.\n3. In the `main()` function, variables `i`, `a`, and `p2` are declared. `a` is initialized with values {8L, 666}.\n4. There is a nested loop structure where `p2` is initialized to 0, and the loop continues as long as `p2` is greater than or equal to 0. Inside this loop, another loop continues as long as `u` is less than or equal to 1, incrementing `u` by 2 each iteration.\n5. Inside the nested loops, the variable `a` is assigned the value of `v[p2]`, and then `v[p2]` is assigned the value of `w`.\n6. After the loops, there is a loop that iterates over `v` array with variable `i`, and the member `q` of each element is assigned to variable `j`.\n7. Finally, the program prints the value of `j` using `printf`.\n\nThe redundant data type is the `signed` data type used for the bit-field `q` within `struct p`. It has a width specified, but it can be substituted with the original `int` data type because it is an equivalent representation.\n\nHere's the modified program with the substitution:\n```json\n{\n  \"program\": \"unsigned j;\\nstruct p {\\n  int ab;\\n  int q : 22;\\n};\\nunsigned u;\\nstruct p v[1];\\nstruct p w = {0x1C87E74FL, 816};\\nint main() {\\n  int i;\\n  struct p a = {8L, 666};\\n  int p2;\\n  for (p2 = 0; p2 >= 0; p2 -= 1)\\n    for (; u <= 1; u += 2) {\\n      a = v[p2] = w;\\n      v[p2] = a;\\n    }\\n  for (i = 0; i < 1; i++)\\n    j = v[i].q;\\n  printf(\\\"checksum = %X\\\\n\\\", j);\\n  return 0;\\n}\"\n}\n```\n\nNote: The provided output is a JSON object containing the modified program code in the \"program\" field.
