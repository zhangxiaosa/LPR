There is a redundant data type defined by the programmer via the `struct` keyword. The defined data type is named `struct p` and has two members: `ab` of type `int` and `q` of type `signed int` with a bit-field size of 22.\n\n2. The program declares an unsigned integer variable `j`, a global array `v` of type `struct p` with size 1, and a global variable `w` of type `struct p` initialized with the values `0x1C87E74FL` and `816`.\n\n3. The `main()` function begins.\n\n4. Inside the `main()` function, there is an integer variable `i` declared and a local variable `a` of type `struct p` initialized with the values `8L` and `666`.\n\n5. There is a `for` loop that iterates while `u` is less than or equal to `1`. The loop increments `u` by `2` in each iteration. Within the loop, the variable `a` is assigned the value of `v[0]`, which in turn is assigned the value of `w`. Then, `v[0]` is assigned the value of `a`.\n\n6. After the first `for` loop, there is another `for` loop that iterates over the elements of `v` using the variable `i`. Inside the loop, the member `q` of `v[i]` is assigned to the variable `j`.\n\n7. Finally, the program outputs the value of `j` using the `printf` function, using the `%X` format specifier to print it as a hexadecimal value.\n\nTo remove the redundant data type, we need to replace every instance of `struct p` with its associated original data type.
