The program starts by declaring several global variables: `g`, `h`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `l`, `m`, and `n`.\n2. The program declares three function prototypes: `fn1`, `fn2`, and `fn3`.\n3. The `fn3` function is defined, which calls `fn1` with arguments `fn2(0)`, `7`, and `0`, and then returns the value of `n`.\n4.

It declares a local variable `v` and initializes `w`. It then enters an infinite loop with a statement `for (i = 0;;)`. Inside the loop, it checks if `k` is non-zero and if true, it breaks the loop and returns the value at `v[g][l][l]`. If `k` is zero, it checks if `h` is zero or not. If `h` is zero, it returns the value at `j[g][g]`. After these checks, there is an empty loop. Finally, it returns `w`.\n6.
