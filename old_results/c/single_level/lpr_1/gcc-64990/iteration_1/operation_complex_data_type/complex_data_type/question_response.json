It then returns the value of `n`.\n12. The function `fn1` is defined, which takes four parameters of types `signed`, `short`, `int`, and `signed`. It performs a logical OR operation with `p1` and assigns the result to `m[1][0][1]`. It then returns the value 2.\n13. The function `fn2` is defined, which takes an unspecified parameter `p1`. It declares a local variable `v` as a 3-dimensional array of type `unsigned`, and initializes a variable `w` with the hexadecimal value `0x709BFC8A`. It then enters an infinite loop with a `for` loop, where `i` is assigned 0. Inside the loop, it checks if `k` is non-zero and breaks the loop if true. It returns the value of `v[g][l][l]`. There is an `if` condition to check the value of `h`, but it does nothing. Then, there is an empty `for` loop that does nothing. Finally, it returns the value of `w`.\n14.
