Function `fn3`:\n   - Calls `fn1` with arguments `fn2(0)`, `7`, and `0`.\n   - Returns the value of `n`.\n\n3. Function `fn1`:\n   - Performs a logical OR operation between `p1` and the expression `m[1][0][1] = p1`. This operation doesn't have any impact on the program because the result is not used.\n   - Returns the constant value 2.\n\n4. Function `fn2`:\n   - Defines a local variable `v` as an uninitialized 3D array of unsigned integers with dimensions `6x3x2`.\n   - Defines a local variable `w` and it is initialized as `0x709BFC8A`.\n   - Enters an infinite loop with the loop variable `i` uninitialized.\n     - Checks if `k` is non-zero and returns `v[g][l][l]` if true. However, since `v`, `g`, and `l` are not initialized, this expression will result in undefined behavior.\n   - Checks if `h` is non-zero, otherwise returns `j[g][g]`. There is no guarantee that `g` and `j` are valid indices, so this expression may also lead to undefined behavior.\n   - Enters an empty loop if `p1` is true (non-zero).
