To optimize the program by inlining a function, we need to identify a suitable function that can be safely inlined.\n\nIn this program, the `fn1()` function seems like a good candidate for inlining because it only contains a single statement, which is a label and a goto statement. The function is also called from within `fn2()` with constant arguments, which makes it easier to substitute the function call with its body.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process to inline the `fn1()` function:\n\n1. Remove the declaration of `fn1()` from the top of the program since we will be inlining the function.\n\n2. Replace the function call `fn1(q, l, p1, 3, p)` inside `fn2()` with the body of `fn1()`. The `fn2()` function now becomes:\n```c\ne fn2(p1) {\n  struct h p;\n  int q;\n  {\n    p.k;\nw:\n    goto w;\n  }\n  for (;;) {\n    struct h r;\n    p = r = p;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n3. Remove the body of the `fn1()` function, including the label and the goto statement.\n\n4.
