The program defines a function `fn2` without specifying the return type, but it appears to be intended to return `e` (typedefed as `typedef unsigned e`).\n\n   The function `fn2` takes a parameter `p1` and declares local variables `struct h p` and `int q`. Inside the function, the `fn1` function is called with various arguments, including `l` (typedefed as `typedef unsigned d`), `p1`, and `p`.\n\n   The function `fn2` also contains a `for` loop where it declares a local variable `struct h r` and assigns `r` to `p`, which in turn is assigned to itself.\n\n6.

The program defines the `main` function with no parameters.\n\nBased on the analysis, the redundant data type in this program is the typedef `c`, which is defined as `typedef long c`.
