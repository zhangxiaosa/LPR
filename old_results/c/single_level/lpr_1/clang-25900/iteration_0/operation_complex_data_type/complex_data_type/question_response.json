Next, a function `fn1` is declared. It takes two parameters: `p1` of type `e` (unsigned) and `p2` of type `int`. The return type of the function is `e` (unsigned). The function simply returns the value of `p2` parameter.\n\n3.

Variables are declared using the defined data types:\n   - `r` of type `c` (int)\n   - `s` which is declared as a static signed long with an initial value of -5\n   - `t` and `u` of type `g` (unsigned)\n   - `v` of type `g` (unsigned)\n\n5. A function `fn4` is defined with a return type of `d` (long). Inside the function:\n   - A variable `ad` of type `struct m` is declared and initialized with a value of 1957 for member `n`.
