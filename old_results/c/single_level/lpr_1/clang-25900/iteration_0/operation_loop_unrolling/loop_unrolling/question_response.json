The program defines a function `fn1` that takes an `e` parameter `p1` and an int parameter `p2` and returns an `e` value.\n\n3. The program defines a struct `m` with two bit fields: `n` with a size of 18 bits and `o` with a size of 1 bit.\n\n4. The program declares several variables:\n   - `r` of type `c`.\n   - `s` as a static variable of type `a` with an initial value of -5.\n   - `t` of type `g`.\n   - `u` of type `c`.\n   - `v` of type `g`.\n\n5. The program defines a function `fn4` that returns a `d` value. Inside the function:\n   - It declares a struct variable `ad` of type `m` and initializes the `n` field with the value 1957.\n   - It assigns the result of calling `fn1` with `v` and 5 to the `o` field of `ad`.\n   - It declares a variable `ae` of type `a`.\n   - It assigns the value of `t` to the variable `af`.\n   - It assigns the value of `ad.o` to the variable `ae`.\n   - It assigns the value of `u` to the `o` field of `ad`.\n   - It calculates the result of the expression `af % (~s / ae)` and assigns it to `r`.\n   - It accesses the `o` field of `ad`, but the result is not used.\n\n6.
