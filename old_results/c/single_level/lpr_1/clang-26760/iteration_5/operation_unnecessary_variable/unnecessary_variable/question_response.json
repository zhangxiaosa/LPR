Therefore, the loop is skipped, and the program moves to the next statement.\n3.

Inside the nested loop, the variable j_value is decremented by 2 each time. Since the loop doesn't have a termination condition, it will run indefinitely.\n5. After the loop, two local variables, l and m, are declared and assigned values. The variable l is assigned the value 1L (long), while m is assigned the value of j_value, which is uninitialized due to the infinite loop.\n6.
