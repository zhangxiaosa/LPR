Loop unrolling is a technique that involves duplicating the loop body multiple times to reduce the overhead of loop control.\n\nHere is the step-by-step analysis of the given program:\n\n1. Define the types `c`, `d`, and `e` using `typedef`.\n```c\ntypedef int c;\ntypedef unsigned d;\ntypedef unsigned e;\n```\n\n2.
