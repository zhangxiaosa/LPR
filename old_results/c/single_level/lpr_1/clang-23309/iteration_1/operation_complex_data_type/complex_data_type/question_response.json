The program defines several functions: `fn1`, `fn2`, `fn3`, `fn4`, `fn5`, `fn6`, `fn7`, `fn10`, `fn11`, `fn12`, and `fn13`.\n2. The program declares global variables of various types: `unsigned p`, `unsigned t`, `unsigned u`, `long v`, `short w`, `unsigned ab`, `short ac`, which are initialized with default values (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, and 1L).\n3. The program defines the function `fn7`, which takes a single parameter `p1`. This function assigns the value of `p1` to the global variable `p`.\n4. The program defines the function `fn13`, which has no parameters. It declares a local variable `short ae` and initializes it with the value 1UL. It then calls the function `fn10` with the arguments `u` and `t`. Finally, it returns the value of `ae`.\n5. The program defines the function `fn10`, which takes two parameters `p1` and `p2`. It declares a local variable `unsigned ag` and initializes it with the value 248UL. It then calls the function `fn11` with the arguments 2L, `ag`, `p2`, and 1. Finally, it returns the value 0x2F2F6D26L.\n6. The program defines the function `fn11`, which takes four parameters `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `p4`. It declares two local variables, `long ai` and `short aj`, and initializes them with the values 7L and 1UL respectively. It then calls the function `fn12` with the arguments `ai`, `ai`, `p1`, 0, and `p1`. Finally, it returns the value of `aj`.\n7. The program defines the function `fn12`, which takes five parameters `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `p4`, and `p5`. It declares three local variables, `int al`, `long am`, and `int an`, and initializes `al` with the value 3L and `am` with the value 1L. Inside a for loop, variable `w` is incremented from 3 to 1. Within the loop, `w` is checked against the value 250UL, and if they are equal, several operations are performed. The function `fn5` is called with arguments `ab` and `ac` and the result is assigned to `p2`. Another conditional statement checks if `(an = w) == 0x294A85636008822DLL`. Inside the condition, a local variable `short ao` is declared and initialized with the value 0xBCD1L. Additionally, there is an if statement that calls `fn2` with the result of `fn3(ao, fn4(fn6(am, an), 0xECL))` and `p2`. The bitwise AND operation on the return value and 1UL is performed, and if the result is nonzero, the global variable `v` is assigned the value 1UL. Finally, the function returns the value of `al`.\n8. The `main` function is defined and has no parameters. It declares a local variable `int ap` and initializes it with the value 0. It then calls `fn13`, `fn7`, and `fn1` with appropriate arguments. Finally, it returns 0.\n\nBased on the analysis, the complex data type in the program is the structure of functions and global variables. The variables can be decomposed into the following primary data types:\n\n- `unsigned p` (global) - `unsigned`\n- `unsigned t` (global) - `unsigned`\n- `unsigned u` (global) - `unsigned`\n- `long v` (global) - `long`\n- `short w` (global) - `short`\n- `unsigned ab` (global) - `unsigned`\n- `short ac` (global) - `short`\n- `short ae` (local to `fn13`) - `short`\n- `unsigned ag` (local to `fn10`) - `unsigned`\n- `long ai` (local to `fn11`) - `long`\n- `short aj` (local to `fn11`) - `short`\n- `int al` (local to `fn12`) - `int`\n- `long am` (local to `fn12`) - `long`\n- `int an` (local to `fn12`) - `int`\n- `short ao` (local to `fn12`) - `short`\n- `int ap` (local to `main`) - `int`\n\nNow, let's write the final program into a JSON file:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"program\": \"void fn1(unsigned p1, int p2) { printf(\\\"checksum = %X\\\\n\\\", p1); }\\nint fn2(int p1, int p2) { return p1 - p2; }\\nlong fn3(long p1, long p2) { return p1 - p2; }\\nunsigned char fn4(unsigned p1, unsigned p2) { return p1; }\\nunsigned fn5(unsigned p1, unsigned p2) { return p2; }\\nunsigned fn6(unsigned p1, unsigned p2) { return p1 - p2; }\\nunsigned p;\\nvoid fn7(p1) { p = p1; }\\nunsigned t;\\nunsigned u;\\nlong v;\\nshort w;\\nunsigned ab;\\nshort ac = 1L;\\nunsigned char fn10(unsigned, short);\\nunsigned char fn11(unsigned char, unsigned, int, short);\\nshort fn12(int, int, unsigned char, short, unsigned);\\nint fn13() {\\n  short ae = 1UL;\\n  fn10(u, t);\\n  return ae;\\n}\\nunsigned char fn10(unsigned p1, short p2) {\\n  unsigned ag = 248UL;\\n  fn11(2L, ag, p2, 1);\\n  return 0x2F2F6D26L;\\n}\\nunsigned char fn11(unsigned char p1, unsigned p2, int p3, short p4) {\\n  long ai = 7L;\\n  short aj = 1UL;\\n  fn12(ai, ai, p1, 0, p1);\\n  return aj;\\n}\\nshort fn12(int p1, int p2, unsigned char p3, short p4, unsigned p5) {\\n  int al = 3L;\\n  long am = 1L;\\n  int an;\\n  for (w = 3; w; w -= 1)\\n    if (an = 250UL) {\\n      p2 = fn5(ab, ac) || (an = w) == 0x294A85636008822DLL;\\n      short ao = 0xBCD1L;\\n      if (fn2(fn3(ao, fn4(fn6(am, an), 0xECL)), p2) & 1UL)\\n        v = 1UL;\\n    }\\n  return al;\\n}\\n\\nint main() {\\n  int ap = 0;\\n  fn13();\\n  fn7(v);\\n  fn1(p, ap);\\n  return 0;\\n}\"\n}\n```\n\nThe program is wrapped into a JSON object with the key \"program\".

The program also declares several variables of different data types: `p`, `t`, `u`, `v`, `w`, `ab`, `ac`, `ae`, `ag`, `ai`, `aj`, `al`, `am`, and `an`.\n3. Function `fn1` takes an `unsigned` parameter `p1` and an `int` parameter `p2`. It prints the value of `p1` using `printf` with a format specifier `%X`.\n4.
