The program declares a function `fn1` that takes a `d` parameter `p1` and an `int` parameter `p2`. It returns the maximum value between `p1` and `p1 << p2`.\n\n3.

The program declares a function `fn2` that takes parameters of types `c`, `i`, `e`, and `b`, and returns a value of type `i`. It implements a nested loop that updates the elements of `n` based on certain conditions.\n\n7. The program declares a function `fn3` that takes a parameter `p1` of type `d`, declares a 2-dimensional array `q` of size 7x7 of type `d`, and initializes variables `r` and `s` of types `i` and `e` respectively. It contains an if statement that calls `fn2` with certain parameters and returns `p1`.\n\n8. The program defines `fn2` that takes parameters `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `p4`, and returns a value of type `i`. It initializes a variable `v` of type `i`, then executes a loop that updates the elements of `n` and `v` based on certain conditions.\n\n9.
