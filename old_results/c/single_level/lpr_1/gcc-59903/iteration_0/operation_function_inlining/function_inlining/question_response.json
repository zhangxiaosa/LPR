The program declares a function `fn2` which takes four parameters: a `c` (integer), a `struct i`, an `e` (unsigned integer), and a `b` (short integer). The function returns a `struct i` value. The function initializes a local variable `v` of type `struct i` with values `0x15L` and `-5L`. It also declares local variables `w` and `a` of type `c`.
