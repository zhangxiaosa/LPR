The function `fn11` calls `fn9` and passes some arguments to it, then returns 0.\n4. The function `fn9` calls `fn10` and passes some arguments to it, then returns `p2`.\n5. The function `fn10` initializes the variable `d` to 2.\n6. It enters a loop where the condition `u < 51` is checked.\n7. Inside the loop, an array `e` of size 9 is declared, and its elements are initialized with a constant value.\n8. The loop calls the function `fn4` with the result of `fn2`, `3`, and the first element of `e` as arguments. The result is stored in `d`.\n9. After the loop, the function returns 3.\n10. The `main` function calls `fn11`, `fn5`, and prints the value of `p` in hexadecimal format.\n11.
