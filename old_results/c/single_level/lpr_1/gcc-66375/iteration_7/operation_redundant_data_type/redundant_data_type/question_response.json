The program declares several variables including:\n   ```c\n   unsigned p;\n   unsigned u;\n   unsigned v_0_3;\n   ```\n   \n3. The program defines a function `fn5` which takes an unspecified argument `p1` and assigns its value to the variable `p`:\n   ```c\n   void fn5(p1) {\n     p = p1;\n   }\n   ```\n   \n4. The program defines the `main` function:\n   ```c\n   int main() {\n     int d = 2L;\n     for (; u < 51; ++u) {\n       unsigned e[9];\n       int i;\n       for (i = 0; i < 9; i++)\n         e[i] = 0x9EE7F9D1C772505BLL;\n       d = fn2(v_0_3 = fn3(4L, d), 3) + e[0];\n     }\n     fn5(v_0_3);\n     printf(\"checksum = %X\\n\", p);\n     return 0;\n   }\n   ```\n\n5. In the `main` function, there is a for loop that iterates until `u` is less than 51. Inside the loop, an array `e` of size 9 is declared and initialized with the value `0x9EE7F9D1C772505BLL`.\n\n6. During each iteration, the `fn2` function is called with the arguments `v_0_3 = fn3(4L, d)` and `3`. The result is added to `e[0]` and stored in the variable `d`.\n\n7. After the loop, the `fn5` function is called with the argument `v_0_3`.\n\n8. Finally, the program prints the value of `p` using the `printf` function.\n\nThe redundant data type in this program is not explicitly defined. All variables have appropriate data types, and there are no typedefs.

Next, we have global variable declarations:\n   - `unsigned p` is an unsigned integer.\n   - `unsigned u` is an unsigned integer.\n   - `unsigned v_0_3` is an unsigned integer.\n\n3. The `main` function begins:\n   - `int d = 2L;` declares an integer `d` and initializes it with the value 2 (as a long integer).\n   - The `for` loop runs while `u` is less than 51:\n     - An array `e` of nine unsigned integers is declared.\n     - An integer `i` is declared and initialized with 0.\n     - Inside the nested `for` loop, each element of `e` is assigned the value `0x9EE7F9D1C772505BLL` (as a long long integer).\n     - The variable `d` is updated by calling `fn2`, passing the result of `fn3(4L, d)` as the first argument and 3 as the second argument, and adding the value at index 0 of array `e`.\n   - The `fn5` function is called, passing `v_0_3` as the argument.\n   - The result of `p` is printed using `printf`, with the format specifier `%X`.\n\n4.
