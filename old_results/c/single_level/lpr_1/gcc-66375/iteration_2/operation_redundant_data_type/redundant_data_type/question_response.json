The given program consists of several functions and a main function.\n2. The function `char fn2(char p1, int p2)` takes a character `p1` and an integer `p2` as parameters and returns a character. The function is not using any redundant data types.\n3. The function `short fn3(short p1, short p2)` takes two short integers as parameters and returns a short integer. The function is not using any redundant data types.\n4. The function `unsigned fn4(unsigned p1, unsigned p2)` takes two unsigned integers as parameters and returns an unsigned integer. The function is not using any redundant data types.\n5. The `fn5` function takes an unspecified parameter `p1` and assigns its value to the global variable `p`.\n6. The `fn6` function takes an unspecified parameter `p1` and calls the `fn5` function with that parameter.\n7. The global variables `t`, `u`, and `v_0_3` are declared as unsigned integers.\n8. The function `unsigned fn9(unsigned p1, unsigned p2, int p3, unsigned p4, int p5)` takes three unsigned integers and two integers as parameters and returns an unsigned integer. The function declares a local variable `c` of type unsigned.\n9. The function `fn10(int p1, unsigned p2, unsigned p3, int p4)` takes an integer and three unsigned integers as parameters and returns an integer. The function declares a local variable `d` of type integer.\n10. The `main` function calls the `fn11` function and then calls the `fn6` function with the global variable `v_0_3`. It also prints the value of the global variable `p`.\n\nIn the given program, there are no redundant data types defined by the programmer via typedef.
