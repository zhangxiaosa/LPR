We can decompose `struct c` into individual variables as follows:\n```\nint d_var = i.d;\nint e_var = i.e;\nint g_var = i.g;\nint h_var = i.h;\n```\nWe can then use these individual variables to represent the values of the `struct c` members in the program.\n\nHere is the modified program with the `struct c` members replaced by their individual variables:\n```\nint main() {\n  int d_var = 24;\n  int e_var = 6738;\n  int g_var = 165;\n  int h_var = 0;\n\n  int m = j.e;\n  d_var = m;\n  int n = j.h && d_var;\n  int p = d_var | -(g_var && d_var) - n;\n  i.g = p;\n}\n```\nNote that we have also initialized the value of `h_var` to 0, as it was not explicitly initialized in the original program.\n\nThe target to be optimized is now `j`, which is a `struct c` variable.
