The program is now using the original data types for the variables.\n\nHere is the final program:\n```\nint main() {\n  int l = 24, m = 6738, n = 165;\n  int p = l | -(l && n) - (j.h && l);\n  i.g = p;\n}\n```\n</SYS>",

The optimized program is as follows:\n```\nint main() {\n  int l = 24;\n  int m = j.e;\n  l.d = m;\n  int n = j.h && l.d;\n  int p = l.d | -(l.g && l.d) - n;\n  i.g = p;\n}\n```\nNote that in the optimized program, the `struct c` type has been eliminated, and the variables `l`, `m`, `n`, and `p` are now of type `int`. The `struct c` type is no longer needed, as it was only used to store three `int` values, which can be easily represented as separate `int` variables.",

Additionally, the optimized program uses the bit field syntax to reduce the size of the `d` field in `struct c` from 18 bits to 16 bits.",

This is done by changing the definition of `struct c` to `int`, and then replacing every instance of `struct c` with `int` in the code.\n\nThe optimized program is:\n```\nint main() {\n  int l = {24, 6738, 165};\n  int m = j.e;\n  l.d = m;\n  int n = j.h && l.d;\n  int p = l.d | -(l.g && l.d) - n;\n  i.g = p;\n}\n```\nNote that this optimization may have changed the behavior of the program, as the `struct c` data type may have been used to represent a specific set of values or semantics that are now lost with the use of `int`. It is important to carefully consider the impact of any changes to the code before making them.",
