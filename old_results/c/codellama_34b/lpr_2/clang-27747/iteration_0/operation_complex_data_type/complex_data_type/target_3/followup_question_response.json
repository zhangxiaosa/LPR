The `struct c` has been replaced with individual variables, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, and `h`, all of which are of type `int` or `unsigned int`. The `struct c` is not needed in the optimized program, as the variables can be accessed directly.\n\nThe optimization has been done by deconstructing the `struct c` into individual variables, and by using the correct data types for each variable. The program is now easier to read and understand, and it has been optimized for performance.",
