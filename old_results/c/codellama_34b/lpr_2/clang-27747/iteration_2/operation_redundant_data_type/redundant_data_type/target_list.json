["`int n`: This variable is not used in the program, so it can be removed.", "`int`: The `int` data type is already defined in the standard library, so there is no need to define it again in the program. The `int` data type can be removed from the program.", "`struct c`: This data type is defined twice in the program, once as `struct c { int d : 18; int e; int h; };` and once as `struct c i;`. The second definition is redundant and can be removed."]
