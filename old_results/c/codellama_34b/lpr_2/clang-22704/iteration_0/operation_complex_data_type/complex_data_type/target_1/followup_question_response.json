We have then changed all the occurrences of `h` in the program to `h_temp`. This ensures that the value of `h` is preserved in the program, but the variable `h` itself is not modified.\n\nThe target to be optimized, `h`, is now a primary data type and can be easily optimized by the compiler.",

The function checks the value of `e` and if it is non-zero, it sets `d` to `h` and calls `fn1` recursively. If `e` is zero, it calls `fn1` recursively and returns `0`. The `main` function initializes the variables `h`, `d`, and `e` and calls `fn1` with them as arguments. The result of the function is printed to the console.\n\nThe target to be optimized is the variable `h` of type `int`. The program is optimized by replacing the recursive calls with a loop and by removing the unnecessary variable `j`. The resulting program is more efficient and easier to understand.",

This allows it to be accessed and modified by any function, including `fn1()`.\n\nThe function `fn1()` has also been modified to use the global variable `j` instead of the local variable `j`. This allows the function to return the correct value of `j` to the caller, regardless of which branch of the `if` statement is taken.\n\nFinally, the `main()` function has been left empty, as it is not necessary for the program to function correctly.\n\nBy decomposing the program into smaller functions and using global variables, we have made the program more modular and easier to understand. The `fn1()` function is now easier to understand, as it only has to worry about its own logic and does not need to worry about the details of the `main()` function. Additionally, the global variables allow us to access and modify the state of the program from anywhere, making it easier to reason about the behavior of the program.",
