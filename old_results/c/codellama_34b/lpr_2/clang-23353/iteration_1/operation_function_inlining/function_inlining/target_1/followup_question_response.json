The function is called in the `fn2` function with the arguments `p3` and `i`. However, the return value of `fn1` is not used in the `fn2` function. Therefore, we can optimize the program by inlining the `fn1` function into the `fn2` function.\n\nIn the optimized program, we have replaced the call to `fn1` with the expression `p3 * i`. This eliminates the need for the `fn1` function and reduces the number of instructions in the program.\n\nNote that the optimized program is functionally equivalent to the original program, but it is more efficient because it avoids the overhead of function calls.",

The function call to `fn1` has been replaced with the expression `(p3 * i) && 1L`, which is the equivalent of calling `fn1` with the arguments `p3` and `i` and then applying the logical AND operator to the result and the constant `1L`.\n\nBy inlining the function `fn1`, we have eliminated the overhead of the function call and the associated stack frame setup and tear-down. This can potentially improve the performance of the program, as the overhead of the function call is eliminated and the code can be executed more efficiently.\n\nNote that inlining `fn1` may not always be possible or desirable, as it can potentially increase the size of the code and make it more difficult to maintain. However, in cases where the function is small and is only called once or a few times, inlining can be a useful optimization technique.",
