This optimization has been performed by constant propagation, which is the process of evaluating constant expressions at compile-time and replacing them with their corresponding values.\n\nIn this case, the compiler has determined that the value of `p3` is always `6` in the loop, and has replaced all occurrences of `p3` with the constant value `6`. This has allowed the compiler to eliminate the variable `p3` from the function, resulting in a smaller and more efficient program.",
