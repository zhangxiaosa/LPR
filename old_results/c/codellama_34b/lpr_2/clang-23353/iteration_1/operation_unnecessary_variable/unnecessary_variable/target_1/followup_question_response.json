This optimization was applied because the return value of `fn1` was not dependent on any input parameters.\n\nThe copy propagation optimization was applied to the `j.h` variable, which was assigned the return value of `fn1`. This optimization was applied because the return value of `fn1` was a constant, and the variable `j.h` was not used anywhere else in the program. Therefore, the assignment of the return value of `fn1` to `j.h` was redundant, and the variable `j.h` could be optimized out.",
