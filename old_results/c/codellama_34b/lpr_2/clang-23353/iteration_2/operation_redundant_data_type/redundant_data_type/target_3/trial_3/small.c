<</SYS>>  The program you provided is a simple C program that defines a function `fn2` that takes an integer argument `p3`, and a function `fn1` that takes two integer arguments `p1` and `p2`. The program also defines a global variable `i` of type `int`, and a structure `g` with a single member `h` of type `signed`.

To eliminate the use of the `signed` data type in the program, we can replace all instances of `signed` with the appropriate unsigned data type. In this case, we can replace `signed` with `unsigned`.

Here is the modified program with all instances of `signed` replaced with `unsigned`:
