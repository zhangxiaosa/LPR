The variable `p1` is passed as a parameter to the function `fn1`, and its value is not modified within the function. Therefore, we can propagate its value to the function call and replace `p1` with `p2` in the function call.\n2. The variable `p2` is also passed as a parameter to the function `fn1`, and its value is not modified within the function. Therefore, we can propagate its value to the function call and replace `p2` with `p3` in the function call.\n3. The variable `j.h` is a struct member and its value is modified within the function `fn2`. Therefore, we cannot propagate its value.\n4. The variable `i` is a global variable and its value is not modified within the function. Therefore, we can propagate its value to the function call and replace `i` with the value of `i`.\n\nAfter propagating the constant values, the optimized program is:\n```\nint fn2(p3) {\n  for (p3 = 6; p3 != -7; p3--)\n    j.h ^= fn1(p3, p3) && 1L;\n  return 0;\n}\n```\nAs you can see, the variable `p2` has been optimized out by constant propagation and copy propagation.",
