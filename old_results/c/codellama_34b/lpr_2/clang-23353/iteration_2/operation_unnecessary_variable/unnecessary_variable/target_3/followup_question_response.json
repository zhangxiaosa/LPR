Here's the optimized program:\n```\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint fn1(char p1, char p2) { return p1 * p2; }\n\nstruct g {\n  signed h;\n};\n\nint i;\nstruct g j;\n\nint fn2() {\n  for (j.h ^= fn1(6, i) && 1L; ;)\n    j.h ^= fn1(6, i) && 1L;\n  return 0;\n}\n\nint main() { return 0; }\n```\nExplanation:\n\n1. Constant propagation: The value of `p3` is always 6, so we can replace all occurrences of `p3` with 6.\n2. Copy propagation: The variable `p3` is not used anywhere else in the program, so we can eliminate it and replace all occurrences of `p3` with 6.\n\nThe optimized program is smaller and more efficient than the original program.",

Copy Propagation: The variable `p3` is not used outside the loop, so we can replace all occurrences of `p3` with `6` in the loop body.\n\nNote that the optimized program still has the same behavior as the original program, but it is more efficient because it avoids unnecessary calculations and memory accesses.",

We have also removed the unused variable `i` from the `fn1` function, as it is not used in the function.\n\nThe program has been optimized using constant propagation and copy propagation, which have helped to reduce the size of the program and improve its performance.

Instead of using `p3` as a parameter in the function `fn2`, we have defined a new variable `p3` inside the function body and initialized it with the value `6`. This new variable `p3` is now used in the loop condition and in the function call to `fn1`.\n\nBy performing copy propagation, we have eliminated the need for the variable `p3` to be passed as a parameter to the function `fn2`, which reduces the number of variables in the program and makes it more efficient.
