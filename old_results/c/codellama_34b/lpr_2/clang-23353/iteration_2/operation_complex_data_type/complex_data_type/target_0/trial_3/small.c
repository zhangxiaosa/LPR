The program you provided is a simple C program that defines a function `fn1` that takes two `char` parameters and returns their product, and a function `fn2` that takes a single `int` parameter and returns 0. The program also defines a global variable `i` of type `int`, and a global variable `j` of type `struct g`, which is a structure with a single member `h` of type `signed`.

To decompose the program into variables with primary data types, we can start by looking at the function `fn1`. The parameters `p1` and `p2` are of type `char`, which is a primary data type. The return type of the function is also a `char`, which is a primary data type.

Next, we can look at the function `fn2`. The parameter `p3` is of type `int`, which is a primary data type. The function also uses the global variable `i` of type `int`, which is a primary data type. The function returns 0, which is a primary data type.

Finally, we can look at the global variable `j` of type `struct g`. This is a composite data type, which is made up of the `h` member of type `signed`. We can decompose this variable into its primary data type by assigning the value of `j.h` to a new variable `h` of type `signed`.

Here is the decomposed program:
