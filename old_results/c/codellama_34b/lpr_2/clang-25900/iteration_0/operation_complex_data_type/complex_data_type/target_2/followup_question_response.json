Identify the complex data type variables: In this case, we have two complex data type variables: `struct m` and `g`.\n2. Decompose the struct: The `struct m` is a structure with two members: `n` and `o`. We can decompose this struct into two separate variables: `n` and `o`.\n3. Decompose the `g` type: The `g` type is a typedef for an unsigned integer. We can replace the `g` type with the corresponding unsigned integer type, which is `unsigned int`.\n\nHere is the decomposed version of the program:\n```\n#include <stdio.h>\n\ntypedef unsigned int g;\n\nint r;\nstatic int s = -5L;\nunsigned int t;\nint u;\n\nint fn4_inlined(p1) {\n  int n = 1957;\n  int o = p1;\n  int ae;\n  int af = t;\n  ae = o;\n  o = u;\n  r = af % (~s / ae);\n  return o;\n}\n\nint main() { fn4_inlined(5); }\n```\nIn this decomposed version, we have replaced the `struct m` with two separate variables `n` and `o`, and we have replaced the `g` type with the corresponding unsigned integer type `unsigned int`.",
