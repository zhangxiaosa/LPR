Constant propagation: The value of `s` is a constant, so it can be propagated and replaced with its value in the code.\n2. Copy propagation: The variable `ae` is assigned the value of `ad.o`, which is a copy of `p1`. Since `p1` is not modified, we can replace `ad.o` with `p1` directly.\n3. Dead store elimination: The variable `ad` is not used after its initialization, so the assignment to `ad.o` can be eliminated.\n4. Dead code elimination: The variable `af` is not used after its initialization, so the assignment to `t_n` can be eliminated.\n5. Dead code elimination: The variable `ae` is not used after its initialization, so the assignment to `ad.o` can be eliminated.\n6. Dead code elimination: The function `fn4_inlined` does not have any side effects, so it can be eliminated.\n\nThe final optimized program is:\n```\nstruct m {\n  int n : 18;\n  int o : 1;\n};\n\nint r;\nstatic int s = -5L;\nint t_n;\nint u;\n\nint main() {\n  r = t_n % (~s / 1957);\n  return u;\n}\n```",
