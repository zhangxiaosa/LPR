The resulting code is smaller and more efficient, as there is no longer a need to call the `fn4_inlined` function. Instead, the code for the function has been directly inserted into the `main` function.\n\nNote that the optimized program still includes the necessary variables and data structures to store the return value of the `fn4_inlined` function, even though the function itself has been inlined. This ensures that the program is still correct and functions as intended.",

However, in the optimized program, the function has been inlined into the `main` function. This means that the code of the `fn4_inlined` function has been directly inserted into the `main` function, and the function call has been removed.\n\nThe inlining process has eliminated the need for the `fn4_inlined` function to be called separately, which can improve the performance of the program by reducing the overhead of function calls. Additionally, the inlined code can be optimized further by the compiler, which can lead to further improvements in performance.",

This is done by removing the function call and replacing it with the body of the function. The function parameters are replaced with their corresponding values.\n\nIn this case, the function has only one parameter `p1`, which is assigned the value `5` in the `main` function. Therefore, the line `ad.o = p1;` becomes `ad.o = 5;`.\n\nThe rest of the code in the function is then executed in the `main` function. The variable `ae` is assigned the value of `ad.o`, which is now `5`. Then, `ad.o` is assigned `0`, and the result of the expression `ad.o % (~s / ad.o)` is stored in `r`. Finally, `ad.o` is set to `0`.\n\nThe optimized program has the same functionality as the original program, but with less code and no function calls.",
