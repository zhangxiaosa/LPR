This optimization is valid because the variable `o` is not used anywhere in the program.\n\nNote that this optimization is a constant propagation optimization, since the value of `o` is never changed and is always equal to 1957.",

Therefore, we can eliminate the variable `ad` and directly use `p1` to calculate `r_tmp`.\n* The variable `s` is a constant and its value is never modified, so we can propagate its value to the calculation of `r_tmp`.\n* The variable `r` is not used anywhere in the program, so we can eliminate it.\n* The function `fn4_inlined` is inlined in the main function, so we can eliminate the function call and directly calculate the value of `r_tmp` in the main function.\n\nThe optimized program is shorter and more efficient, as it eliminates unnecessary variables and calculations.",
