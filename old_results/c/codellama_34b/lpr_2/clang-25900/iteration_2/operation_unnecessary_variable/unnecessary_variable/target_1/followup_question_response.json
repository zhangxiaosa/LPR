However, the variable `ae` is only used once in the program, and its value is not changed after it is assigned. Therefore, the variable `ae` can be optimized out by constant propagation or copy propagation.\n\nIn this optimized program, the variable `ae` is replaced with its value `ad.o` wherever it is used. This reduces the number of variables in the program and makes the code more efficient.\n\nNote that the optimization is only applied to the `fn4_inlined` function, as the `ae` variable is only used within that function. The `main` function is unchanged.",

Copy Propagation:\nThe variable `ae` is assigned the value of `ad.o`, which is a field of the struct `m`. Since `ad.o` is not modified in the function, we can replace all occurrences of `ae` with `ad.o`.\n```\nr_tmp = ad.o % (~(-5) / ad.o);\n```\n3.

The function has a local variable `ad` of type `struct m` and initializes it with the value `1957`. The function then assigns the value of `p1` to the `o` field of `ad`, and then assigns the value of `ad.o` to a local variable `ae`.\n\nThe program then calculates a value for `r_tmp` by taking the remainder of `ae` and `~s / ae`, which is equivalent to `ae % (~s / ae)`. The value of `r_tmp` is then assigned to the global variable `r`. Finally, the function returns the value of `ad.o`.\n\nThe target to be optimized is the variable `ae`. The optimization can be performed by constant propagation or copy propagation.\n\nBy constant propagation, we can replace the variable `ae` with its constant value `5` throughout the function.

This will also simplify the code and remove the need to calculate the value of `ae` in the first place. The optimized function would look like this:\n```\nint fn4_inlined(p1) {\n  struct m ad = {1957};\n  ad.o = p1;\n  ad.o = 0;\n  int r_tmp = p1 % (~s / p1);\n  r = r_tmp;\n  return ad.o;\n}\n```\nIn both cases, the optimized function has fewer instructions and is more efficient than the original function.",
