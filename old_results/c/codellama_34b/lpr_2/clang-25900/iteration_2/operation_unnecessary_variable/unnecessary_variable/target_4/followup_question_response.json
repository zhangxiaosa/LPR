Therefore, we can propagate this value throughout the function and replace all occurrences of `s` with `-5L`.\n\nThe optimized code for the function `fn4_inlined` after constant propagation would be:\n```\nint fn4_inlined(p1) {\n  struct m ad = {1957};\n  ad.o = p1;\n  int ae = ad.o;\n  ad.o = 0;\n  int r_tmp = ae % (~-5L / ae);\n  r = r_tmp;\n  return ad.o;\n}\n```\n1.

Constant propagation:\nSince the value of `s` is known at compile-time, we can propagate its value throughout the program and replace it with the constant value `-5L`.

Copy propagation:\nThe variable `r` is assigned the value of `ae % (~s / ae)` in the function `fn4_inlined`. However, the value of `ae` is not changed in the function, so we can propagate the value of `ae` from the function call to the assignment of `r` in the main function. This will simplify the expression `ae % (~s / ae)` to `5 % (~5L / 5)`, which can be evaluated at compile-time as well.\n\nThe optimized program is:\n```\nstruct m {\n  int n : 18;\n  int o : 1;\n};\nint r;\nstatic int s = -5L;\nint fn4_inlined(p1) {\n  struct m ad = {1957};\n  ad.o = p1;\n  int ae = ad.o;\n  ad.o = 0;\n  int r_tmp = ae % (~s / ae);\n  r = r_tmp;\n  return ad.o;\n}\nint main() {\n  fn4_inlined(5);\n  r = 5 % (~5L / 5);\n}\n```\nThe optimized program has the same behavior as the original program, but it is simpler and more efficient because it eliminates the unnecessary computation of `ae % (~s / ae)` and propagates the value of `ae` from the function call to the assignment of `r` in the main function.",
