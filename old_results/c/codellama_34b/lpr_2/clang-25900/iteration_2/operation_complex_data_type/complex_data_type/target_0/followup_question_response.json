The program also defines a function `fn4_inlined` that takes an integer argument `p1` and returns an integer value.\n\nTo decompose the program into variables with primary data types, we can start by breaking down the structure variable `ad` into its individual members. We can then modify the program to use these individual members instead of the structure variable.\n\nHere is the decomposed program:\n```\nint n = 18;\nint o = 1;\nint p1;\nstatic int s = -5L;\n\nint fn4_inlined(p1) {\n  int ae;\n  ae = o;\n  o = 0;\n  r = ae % (~s / ae);\n  return o;\n}\n\nint main() {\n  fn4_inlined(5);\n}\n```\nIn this decomposed program, we have defined three integer variables: `n`, `o`, and `p1`. We have also defined a static integer variable `s` with the value `-5L` and a function `fn4_inlined` that takes an integer argument `p1` and returns an integer value.\n\nThe program still performs the same operations as the original program, but now the structure variable `ad` has been broken down into its individual members. This can make it easier to optimize the program, as the structure variable `ad` is no longer used.",
