The function body is inlined, meaning that it is inserted directly into the calling code, and it uses the `struct m` type to store its local variables.\n\nTo optimize the program, we can identify the following data types:\n\n1. `struct m`: This is the structure type that is defined in the program. It has two members, `n` and `o`, which are both integers.\n2. `int`: This is the type of the function's return value and the type of the `ad.o` member.\n3. `void`: This is the type of the function's parameter `p1` and the type of the `ae` variable.\n\nTo optimize the program, we can eliminate the `struct m` type and substitute it with its associated original data type, which is `int`. This can be done by replacing all instances of `struct m` with `int` in the program.\n\nHere is the optimized program:\n```\nint fn4_inlined(int p1) {\n  int ad = 1957;\n  ad = p1;\n  int ae;\n  ae = ad;\n  ad = 0;\n  r = ae % (~s / ae);\n  return ad;\n}\n\nint main() {\n  fn4_inlined(5);\n}\n```\nIn this optimized program, the `struct m` type has been eliminated and replaced with `int` in all instances.

The function `fn4_inlined` now takes an `int` parameter `p1` and returns an `int`. The variable `s` is still a static `int` initialized to -5L. The program is now optimized to use only the original data types and eliminate the use of the struct `m`.",
