We have also added a `return` statement at the end of the function to return the result of the computation.\n\nNote that this optimization is only possible because `fn2` is a very simple function with a single statement, and because it does not have any side effects. If `fn2` were more complex, or if it had side effects, then this optimization would not be possible.",

The function has a loop that increments a variable `j` until it reaches a certain value, and then performs a series of operations on that value.\n\nTo optimize the function, we can use function inlining to eliminate the function call and instead copy the function's body directly into the calling code.
