Constant Propagation:\nThe variable `l` is assigned the value 1L at the beginning of the program, and it is not modified anywhere else. Therefore, we can replace all occurrences of `l` with the constant value 1L.\n\nOptimized program:\n```\n#include <stdint.h>\n\nint16_t fn1() {\n  int32_t m = 0x24F96B7BL;\n  uint32_t k;\n  for (uint32_t f; f;) {\n    m -= 8;\n  }\n  k = k >> 1L;\n  if (m) {\n    k = k << m;\n    goto q;\n  }\n}\n\nint main() {}\n```\n2.

However, the value of `l` is never modified after its initialization, so it can be considered a constant. Therefore, we can apply constant propagation to the variable `l` and replace its uses with the constant value `1L`.\n\nAfter applying constant propagation, the program becomes:\n```\n#include <stdint.h>\n\nint16_t fn1() {\n  int32_t m = 0x24F96B7BL;\n  uint32_t k;\n  for (uint32_t f; f;) {\n    m -= 8;\n  }\n  q:;\n  k = k >> 1L;\n  if (m) {\n    k = k << m;\n    goto q;\n  }\n}\n\nint main() {}\n```\nNote that the variable `l` has been optimized out and is no longer used in the program.",
