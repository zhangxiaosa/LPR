The optimization goal is to reduce the execution time of the program.\n\nTo achieve this goal, we can decompose the variable `f` into smaller variables with primary data types, such as `uint8_t` or `uint16_t`. This can help reduce the number of instructions required to manipulate the variable, which can in turn reduce the execution time of the program.\n\nHere is an example of how we can decompose the variable `f` into smaller variables:\n```\nuint8_t f_low  = f & 0xFF;\nuint8_t f_high = (f >> 8) & 0xFF;\n```\nWe can then use these smaller variables in the program instead of the original `f` variable. For example, we can replace `f` with `f_low` and `f_high` in the loop condition like this:\n```\nfor (f_low = 0; f_low;) {\n  j -= 8;\n  i = j;\n}\n```\nSimilarly, we can replace `f` with `f_low` and `f_high` in the `if` statement like this:\n```\nif (i) {\n  k = k << m;\n  goto q;\n}\n```\nBy decomposing the variable `f` into smaller variables, we can reduce the execution time of the program by reducing the number of instructions required to manipulate the variable.",
