Given the following program and the first line of a loop, optimize it out via loop unrolling.. The program is #include <stdint.h>
int16_t fn1() {
  int32_t m = 0x24F96B7BL;
  uint32_t k;
  for (uint32_t f; f;)
    m -= 8;
q:;
  k = k << m;
  if (m) {
    k = k >> 1L;
    goto q;
  }
}
int main() {}
.                 The target to be optimized is while (m) {.

Optimized program:
