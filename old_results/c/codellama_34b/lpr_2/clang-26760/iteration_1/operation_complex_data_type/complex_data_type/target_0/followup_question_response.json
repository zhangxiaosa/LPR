The variable `f` has been added to keep track of the loop iteration.\n\nThe program is now much simpler and easier to understand, and the performance has been improved by using primary data types instead of complex data types.",

The `k_low` variable contains the low byte of `k`, and the `k_high` variable contains the high byte of `k`.\n\nWe can then use these primary data types to optimize the program.

This can help to reduce the number of instructions required to perform the desired operations.\n\nNote that the `k` variable is still a `uint32_t` variable, but we have decomposed it into its low and high bytes to perform the bitwise operations.
