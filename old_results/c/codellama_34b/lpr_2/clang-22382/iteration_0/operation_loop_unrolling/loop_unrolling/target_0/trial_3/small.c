Given the following program and the first line of a loop, optimize it out via loop unrolling.. The program is typedef short a;
typedef int b;
typedef long c;
typedef unsigned d;
typedef unsigned e;
typedef unsigned f;
typedef unsigned g;
struct h {
  signed i;
  c j;
  unsigned k;
};
d l;
static struct h fn1(f, a, g, d, struct h);
e fn2(p1) {
  struct h p;
  b q;
  fn1(q, l, p1, 3, p);
  for (;;) {
    struct h r;
    p = r = p;
  }
}
struct h fn1(f p1, a p2, g p3, d p4,
                  struct h p5) {
  p5.k;
w:;
  goto w;
}
int main() {}
.                 The target to be optimized is Line 14: for (;;) {.

Optimization:

The loop on line 14 is an infinite loop that assigns the value of `p` to `r` and then assigns the value of `r` to `p`. This loop can be optimized out by removing the loop and simply assigning the value of `p` to `r` and `p`.
