This will eliminate the function call overhead and make the program more efficient.\n\nHere is the optimized program:\n```\nstruct h {\n  int i;\n  long j;\n  int k;\n};\nint l;\n\nint fn2(p1) {\n  struct h p;\n  for (;;) {\n    struct h r;\n    p = r = p;\n  }\n}\n\nint main() {}\n```\nIn this optimized program, the `fn1` function has been inlined into the `fn2` function. The code for `fn1` has been copied into the `fn2` function, and the function call to `fn1` has been removed. The resulting program is smaller and more efficient, as it avoids the overhead of a function call.",
