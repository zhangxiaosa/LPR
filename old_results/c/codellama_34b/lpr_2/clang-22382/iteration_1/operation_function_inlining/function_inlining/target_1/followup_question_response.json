This has resulted in a significant reduction in the number of function calls, which can improve the performance of the program.\n\nThe inlined code for `fn1` is:\n```\np5.k;\nw:;\n  goto w;\n```\nThis code is equivalent to the original code for `fn1`, but with the function call to `fn1` removed. The variable `p5` is still defined and used in the inlined code, but it is no longer passed as a parameter to `fn1`. Instead, it is defined and used within the body of `fn2`.\n\nThe inlined code for `fn2` is:\n```\nstruct h p;\np = r = p;\nfor (;;) {\n  struct h r;\n  p = r = p;\n}\n```\nThis code is equivalent to the original code for `fn2`, but with the function call to `fn1` removed.

The function `fn2` takes a single parameter `p1` and calls `fn1` with the arguments `p1`, `l`, `p1`, `3`, and `p`. The function `fn2` then enters an infinite loop where it assigns the address of a `struct h` to the variable `r` and then assigns the value of `p` to `r`.\n\nThe optimization of function inlining can be applied to `fn2` by replacing the call to `fn1` with the body of `fn1`. The resulting code would look like this:\n```\nstruct h {\n  int i;\n  long j;\n  int k;\n};\n\nint l;\n\nint fn2(p1) {\n  struct h p;\n  p.k;\nw:;\n  goto w;\n  for (;;) {\n    struct h r;\n    p = r = p;\n  }\n}\n\nint main() {}\n```\nIn this optimized version of the code, the function `fn2` now has the same body as `fn1`, and the call to `fn1` has been replaced with the body of `fn1`. This eliminates the overhead of a function call and improves the performance of the program.",
