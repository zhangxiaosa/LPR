Therefore, the loop can be optimized out by copy propagation, and the program can be simplified to:\n```\nstruct h {\n  int i;\n  long j;\n  int k;\n};\nstatic struct h fn1(int p1, short p2, int p3, int p4, struct h p5) {\n  p5.k;\nw:;\n  goto w;\n}\nint fn2(p1) {\n  struct h p;\n  fn1(p1, 1, p1, 3, p);\n}\nint main() {}\n```\nNote that the optimized program still has the same behavior as the original program, but with fewer instructions and no unused variables.",
