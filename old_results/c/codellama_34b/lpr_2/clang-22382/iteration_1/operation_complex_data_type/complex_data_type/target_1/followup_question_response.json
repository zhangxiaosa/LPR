The `fn1` function now takes a `struct h` parameter instead of an `int` parameter, and it uses the `k` field of the structure to perform the computation.\n\nIn `main`, the `h1`, `h2`, and `h3` variables are initialized with values of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, respectively. These values are used to initialize the `struct h` variables that are passed as arguments to `fn1` and `fn2`.\n\nThe `fn1` function is now responsible for computing the value of the `p` variable, which is a `struct h` variable. The `fn2` function is now responsible for passing the `p` variable to `fn1`.\n\nThe `main` function now calls `fn1` and `fn2` with the appropriate arguments, and it prints the result of the computation to the console.\n\nI hope this helps!
