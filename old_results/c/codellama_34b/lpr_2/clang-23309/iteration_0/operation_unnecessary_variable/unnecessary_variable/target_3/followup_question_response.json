This gives us the following expression:\n```\nao = 0xBCD1L - (fn6(1L, an) - 0xECL)\n```\nNext, we can propagate the value of `an` into the expression `fn6(1L, an)`.

Since the function `fn4` is a pure function that only depends on its inputs and not on any external state, it can be optimized away, and the expression can be simplified to `1L - fn6(1L, an)`.\n\nFurthermore, the function `fn6` is also a pure function, and it can be optimized away as well.
