Function inlining: The function `fn2` is called only once in the `fn13` function, and it has a relatively simple implementation. Therefore, we can inline the function body directly into the `fn13` function to avoid the overhead of function call.\n2. Constant folding and propagation: The function `fn2` has a constant argument `p1`, which is a constant expression. We can evaluate this expression at compile-time and replace it with the resulting value. This can simplify the function body and reduce the number of instructions.\n3. Dead code elimination: The function `fn2` has a dead code path that is never executed due to the constant folding optimization. We can eliminate this dead code to further reduce the size of the function.\n4. Register allocation: The function `fn2` has a single argument `p1`, which is used as an input to the function. We can allocate this argument to a register, which can reduce the number of memory accesses and improve performance.\n\nAfter applying these optimizations, the optimized `fn2` function looks like this:\n```\nb fn2(b p1, b p2) {\n    return p1 - p2;\n}\n```\nThe optimized `fn13` function looks like this:\n```\nb fn13() {\n    const e ae = 1UL;\n    const b af = 0x2F2F6D26L;\n    const d ag = 248UL;\n    const c ai = 7L;\n    const e aj = 1UL;\n    const b al = 3L;\n    const c am = 1L;\n    const b an;\n    for (w = 3; w; w -= 1)\n        if (an = 250UL) {\n            t = fn5(ab, ac) || (an = w) == 0x294A85636008822DLL;\n            const b ao = 0xBCD1L;\n            if (fn2(fn3(ao, fn4(fn6(am, an), 0xECL)), t) & 1UL)\n                v = 1UL;\n        }\n    return al;\n}\n```\nThe optimized `main` function looks like this:\n```\nint main() {\n    int ap = 0;\n    fn13();\n    fn9(v, \"g_170\", ap);\n    fn1(p, ap);\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nNote that the optimized `fn2` function is not longer a separate function, but is instead inlined directly into the `fn13` function.",
