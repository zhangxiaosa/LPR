This is because the `a` type is only used once in the program, and it is used as a parameter in the `fn13` function. Since the `fn13` function does not modify the `a` parameter, it is safe to eliminate the `a` type and replace it with its original data type, which is `int`.\n\nNote that the elimination of the `a` type has also resulted in the elimination of the `fn6` function, which is no longer needed since the `a` parameter is no longer used.",
