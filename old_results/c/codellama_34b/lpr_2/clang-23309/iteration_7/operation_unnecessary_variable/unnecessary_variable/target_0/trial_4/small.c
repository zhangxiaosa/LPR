The given program has several variables, but the target variable to be optimized is `ac`. By using constant propagation and copy propagation, we can optimize out the variable `ac` and simplify the program.

First, we can analyze the code and determine that the value of `ac` is always 1, as it is initialized to 1 and never modified. Therefore, we can replace all occurrences of `ac` with the value 1.

Next, we can analyze the code and determine that the variable `an` is only used once, in the expression `ac || (an = 0)`. Since the value of `ac` is always 1, we can simplify this expression to `1 || (an = 0)`, which is always true. Therefore, we can remove the variable `an` and the expression `ac || (an = 0)`, as they are not needed.

Finally, we can analyze the code and determine that the variable `tmp1` is only used once, in the expression `tmp2 - tmp1 & 1`. Since the value of `tmp1` is always 1, we can simplify this expression to `tmp2 - 1 & 1`, which is the same as `tmp2 & 1`. Therefore, we can remove the variable `tmp1` and the expression `tmp2 - tmp1 & 1`, as they are not needed.

The optimized program is:
