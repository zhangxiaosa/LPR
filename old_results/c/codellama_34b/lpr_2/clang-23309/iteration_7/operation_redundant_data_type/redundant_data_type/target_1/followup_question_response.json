This is because the `short` data type is not necessary for the calculations being performed in the program.\n\nThe optimization has been done by substituting every instance of `short` with `unsigned short` and removing the declaration of the `t` variable, which was not used in the program.\n\nThe resulting program is faster and more efficient as it avoids the overhead of using a signed data type, and it also avoids the need to perform any explicit type conversions.",

This is because the `short` data type is not necessary for the program to function correctly, as all instances of `short` can be represented as `int` data types without any loss of precision.\n\nOptimizing the program to use `int` data type instead of `short` data type can lead to better performance, as `int` data types are typically faster to process on most modern computer systems. Additionally, using `int` data types can make the program more flexible and easier to maintain, as it eliminates the need to handle the special cases of `short` data types.",
