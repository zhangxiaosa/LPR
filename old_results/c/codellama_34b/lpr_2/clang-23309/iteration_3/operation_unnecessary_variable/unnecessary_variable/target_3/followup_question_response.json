Constant propagation: The constant `0x294A` is assigned to `an` in the first iteration of the loop. Since `an` is never modified in the loop, its value is constant and can be propagated throughout the program. Therefore, the value of `an` is replaced with `0x294A` in the `fn2` and `fn4` functions.\n2. Copy propagation: The value of `ao` is copied to the `t` variable before it is used in the `fn2` function. Since `t` is never modified in the loop, its value is the same as `ao`, and the copy can be eliminated.\n3. Dead code elimination: The `an` variable is never used after it is assigned in the loop. Therefore, the line `an = 0x294A` can be removed.\n4. Constant folding: The expression `fn4(1 - an, 0xECL)` can be simplified to `fn4(1 - 0x294A, 0xECL)`, which is a constant expression. Therefore, the result of this expression can be computed at compile-time and the function call can be eliminated.\n\nThe optimized program is smaller and more efficient, with fewer instructions and no dead code.",
