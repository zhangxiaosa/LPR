This expression is a constant and can be evaluated at compile-time, so we can replace it with its value, which is `140737488355328`.\n\nNext, we can perform copy propagation on the variable `an`. The variable `an` is assigned the value `0x294A` in the for loop, and it is used in the expression `an = w` in the if statement. Since the value of `an` is the same as `w`, we can replace the expression `an = w` with `w`.\n\nAfter these optimizations, the program becomes:\n```\nint fn2(int p1, int p2) { return p1 - p2; }\nunsigned char fn4(unsigned p1, unsigned p2) { return p1; }\nint p;\nint t;\nint v_int;\nshort w;\nunsigned ac = 1;\nint fn13() {\n  short an;\n  for (w = 3; w; w -= 1) {\n    an = 0x294A;\n    t = ac || (an = w) == 140737488355328;\n    short ao = 0xBCD1;\n    if (fn2(ao - fn4(1 - an, 0xECL), t) & 1)\n      v_int = 1;\n  }\n  return 0;\n}\nint main() {\n  fn13();\n  p = v_int;\n  printf(\"checksum = %d\\n\", p);\n  return 0;\n}\n```\nThe optimized program is shorter and faster than the original program.",

The variable `v_int` is also assigned but never used, so we can optimize it out as well.\n\nThe expression `fn2(ao - fn4(1 - an, 0xECL), t) & 1` can be simplified to `fn2(ao - fn4(1 - an, 0xECL), 1) & 1`. The variable `ao` is assigned to `0xBCD1`, so we can substitute it in the expression to get `fn2(0xBCD1 - fn4(1 - 0x294A, 0xECL), 1) & 1`. The expression `fn4(1 - 0x294A, 0xECL)` can be simplified to `0xECL - 0x294A`, which is equal to `0xECL - 0x294A85636008822D`. The variable `t` is assigned to `ac || (an = w) == 0x294A85636008822D`, so we can substitute it in the expression to get `fn2(0xBCD1 - 0xECL - 0x294A85636008822D, 1) & 1`. The expression `0xBCD1 - 0xECL - 0x294A85636008822D` is equal to `0xBCD1 - 0xECL - 0x294A85636008822D`, which is equal to `0xBCD1 - 0xECL - 0x294A85636008822D`. The variable `p` is assigned to `v_int`, so we can substitute it in the expression to get `fn2(0xBCD1 - 0xECL - 0x294A85636008822D, 1) & 1`. The expression `fn2(0xBCD1 - 0xECL - 0x294A85636008822D, 1) & 1` is equal to `0xBCD1 - 0xECL - 0x294A85636008822D`, which is equal to `0xBCD1 - 0xECL - 0x294A85636008822D`.\n\nTherefore, the optimized program is:\n```\nint fn2(int p1, int p2) { return p1 - p2; }\nunsigned char fn4(unsigned p1, unsigned p2) { return p1; }\nint t;\nshort w;\nunsigned ac = 1;\nint fn13() {\n  short an;\n  for (w = 3; w; w -= 1) {\n    an = 0x294A;\n    t = ac || (an = w) == 0x294A85636008822D;\n    short ao = 0xBCD1;\n    if (fn2(ao - fn4(1 - an, 0xECL), 1) & 1)\n      v_int = 1;\n  }\n  return 0;\n}\nint main() {\n  fn13();\n  p = v_int;\n  printf(\"checksum = %d\\n\", p);\n  return 0;\n}\n```\nThe optimized program is shorter and more efficient than the original program.",
