Therefore, we can replace all references to `ao` with the constant value `0xBCD1L`.\n\nHere's the optimized program:\n```\nint fn1(p1) {\n  printf(\"checksum = %X\\n\", p1);\n  return p1;\n}\nint fn2(int p1, int p2) { return p1 - p2; }\nunsigned char fn4(unsigned p1, unsigned p2) { return p1; }\nint fn6(int p1, int p2) { return p1 - p2; }\nint p;\nint t;\nint v;\nshort w;\nunsigned ac = 1L;\nint fn13() {\n  int al = 3L;\n  short an;\n  for (w = 3; w; w -= 1) {\n    an = 250UL;\n    t = ac || (an = w) == 0x294A85636008822DLL;\n    if (fn2(0xBCD1L - fn4(fn6(1L, an), 0xECL), t) & 1UL)\n      v = 1;\n  }\n  return al;\n}\nint main() {\n  fn13();\n  p = v;\n  fn1(p);\n  return 0;\n}\n```\nAs you can see, all references to `ao` have been replaced with the constant value `0xBCD1L`.\n\nNext, I'll use copy propagation to optimize the `an` variable. The `an` variable is assigned the value `w` in the `for` loop, and it is never modified. Therefore, we can replace all references to `an` with the variable `w`.\n\nHere's the optimized program:\n```\nint fn1(p1) {\n  printf(\"checksum = %X\\n\", p1);\n  return p1;\n}\nint fn2(int p1, int p2) { return p1 - p2; }\nunsigned char fn4(unsigned p1, unsigned p2) { return p1; }\nint fn6(int p1, int p2) { return p1 - p2; }\nint p;\nint t;\nint v;\nshort w;\nunsigned ac = 1L;\nint fn13() {\n  int al = 3L;\n  for (w = 3; w; w -= 1) {\n    t = ac || (w = w) == 0x294A85636008822DLL;\n    if (fn2(0xBCD1L - fn4(fn6(1L, w), 0xECL), t) & 1UL)\n      v = 1;\n  }\n  return al;\n}\nint main() {\n  fn13();\n  p = v;\n  fn1(p);\n  return 0;\n}\n```\nAs you can see, all references to `an` have been replaced with the variable `w`.\n\nFinally, I'll use dead code elimination to optimize the `t` variable.
