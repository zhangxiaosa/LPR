The `main` function has also been simplified to call `fn1` with the argument `1`.",

Constant Propagation:\n\nIn the function `fn13()`, the variable `an` is assigned the value `250UL` and is only used in the expression `an = w == 0x294A85636008822DLL`. Since the value of `w` is known at compile-time, we can evaluate the expression `250UL == 0x294A85636008822DLL` at compile-time and simplify it to `0`. Therefore, the assignment `an = w == 0x294A85636008822DLL` can be replaced with `an = 0`.\n\n2. Copy Propagation:\n\nIn the function `fn13()`, the variable `t` is assigned the value `ac || (an = w) == 0x294A85636008822DLL`. Since `an` is assigned the value `0` in the previous step, we can simplify the expression to `ac || 0 == 0x294A85636008822DLL`. Since `ac` is a constant, we can evaluate the expression at compile-time and simplify it to `0`. Therefore, the assignment `t = ac || (an = w) == 0x294A85636008822DLL` can be replaced with `t = 0`.\n\n3. Removing the unused variable `v`:\n\nSince the variable `v` is not used anywhere in the program, it can be removed.\n\nThe optimized program is as follows:\n```\nint fn1(p1) {\n  printf(\"checksum = %X\\n\", p1);\n  return p1;\n}\nint fn2(int p1, int p2) { return p1 - p2; }\nunsigned char fn4(unsigned p1, unsigned p2) { return p1; }\nint fn6(int p1, int p2) { return p1 - p2; }\nint p;\nint t;\nshort w;\nunsigned ac = 1L;\nint fn13() {\n  int al = 3L;\n  short an;\n  for (w = 3; w; w -= 1) {\n    an = 250UL;\n    t = 0;\n    short ao = 0xBCD1L;\n    if (fn2(ao - fn4(fn6(1L, an), 0xECL), t) & 1UL)\n      return 1;\n  }\n  return al;\n}\nint main() {\n  fn13();\n  p = 0;\n  fn1(p);\n  return 0;\n}\n```\nNote that the optimized program is functionally equivalent to the original program, but it has been simplified by removing the unused variable `v` and the unnecessary computation of `v`.",
