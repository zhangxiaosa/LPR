Simplify the expression for `t`:\n```\nt = ac || (an = w);\n```\ncan be simplified to:\n```\nt = ac || w;\n```\nsince `an = w` is always true.\n2. Simplify the expression for `temp`:\n```\nint temp = ao - (1 - an);\n```\ncan be simplified to:\n```\nint temp = ao + an;\n```\nsince `1 - an` is always `0` when `an` is `0x294A`.\n3. Simplify the expression for `v_int`:\n```\nv_int = fn2(temp, t) & 1;\n```\ncan be simplified to:\n```\nv_int = temp & 1;\n```\nsince `fn2(temp, t)` is always `temp` when `t` is `ac || w`.\n\nThe optimized program is:\n```\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n  short an = 0x294A;\n  short ao = 0xBCD1;\n  int temp = ao + an;\n  int v_int = temp & 1;\n  printf(\"checksum = %d\\n\", v_int);\n  return 0;\n}\n```\nThis program is optimal because it uses the minimum number of operations to compute the final result, which is `v_int`.",
