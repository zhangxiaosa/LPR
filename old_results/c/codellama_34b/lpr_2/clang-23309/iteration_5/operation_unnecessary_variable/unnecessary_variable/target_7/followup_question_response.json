Constant propagation:\nThe expression `t = ac || (an = 0)` can be evaluated at compile-time, since `ac` and `an` are both constants. The result of this expression is `ac = 1`, so the statement `t = ac || (an = 0)` can be replaced with `t = 1`.\n2. Copy propagation:\nThe variable `ao` is assigned the value `0xBCD1`, but it is not used in the program. Therefore, the statement `short ao = 0xBCD1` can be removed, and the expression `ao - (1 - an)` can be replaced with `0xBCD1 - (1 - an)`.\n3. Unused variable elimination:\nThe variable `w` is not used in the program, so it can be removed.\n\nThe optimized program is:\n```\nint fn2(int p1, int p2) { return p1 - p2; }\nint t;\nint v_int;\nint main() {\n  short an = 0x294A;\n  t = 1;\n  int temp = 0xBCD1 - (1 - an);\n  v_int = fn2(temp, t) & 1;\n  printf(\"checksum = %d\\n\", v_int);\n  return 0;\n}\n```",

The expression `ao - (1 - an)` has been simplified to `ao - an`, and the result of this expression is stored in the `temp` variable. The `temp` variable is then passed as an argument to the `fn2` function, along with the `t` variable. The result of the `fn2` function is stored in the `v_int` variable, and the `printf` function is called to print the value of `v_int`.\n\nThe program is now optimized and the unused variable `w_val` has been eliminated, resulting in a more efficient program.",
