Since `ac` is a constant, it can be directly used in the expression `ao - (1 - an)` instead of storing it in a separate variable.\n* `w_val`: This variable was only used to store the value of `w`, which is a constant.

The variable `t` has been optimized out, and its value has been replaced with the value `0` where it is used.\n\nThe optimization has been done using constant propagation and copy propagation. Constant propagation is the process of evaluating constant expressions and replacing them with their corresponding values. In this case, the constant expression `ac_val = ac` has been evaluated and replaced with the value `1`. Similarly, the constant expression `w_val = w` has been evaluated and replaced with the value `0`. The constant expression `an_val = an` has been evaluated and replaced with the value `0x294A`. The constant expression `t = ac_val || (an_val = w_val)` has been evaluated and replaced with the value `0`.\n\nCopy propagation is the process of replacing a copy of a variable with the original variable. In this case, the copy of the variable `an` has been replaced with the original variable `an` in the expression `an_val = an`. Similarly, the copy of the variable `w` has been replaced with the original variable `w` in the expression `w_val = w`. The copy of the variable `ac` has been replaced with the original variable `ac` in the expression `ac_val = ac`.\n\nOverall, the optimization has simplified the program and reduced the number of variables used.
