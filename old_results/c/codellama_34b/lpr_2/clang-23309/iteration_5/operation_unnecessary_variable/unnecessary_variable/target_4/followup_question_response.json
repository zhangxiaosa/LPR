The variable `ac_val` is assigned the value of `ac`, which is a constant. Therefore, `ac_val` is not used anywhere in the program and can be optimized out.\n2. The variable `w_val` is assigned the value of `w`, which is a constant. Therefore, `w_val` is not used anywhere in the program and can be optimized out.\n3. The variable `an_val` is assigned the value of `an`, which is a constant. Therefore, `an_val` is not used anywhere in the program and can be optimized out.\n4. The expression `t = ac || (an = w)` can be simplified to `t = ac`, since the expression `(an = w)` is always true.\n5. The expression `ao - (1 - an)` can be simplified to `ao - 1 + an`, since `1 - an` is always 0.\n6. The expression `v_int = fn2(temp, t) & 1` can be simplified to `v_int = fn2(temp, ac) & 1`, since `t` is always equal to `ac`.\n\nTherefore, the optimized program is:\n```c\nint fn2(int p1, int p2) { return p1 - p2; }\nint t;\nint v_int;\nshort w;\nunsigned ac = 1;\nint main() {\n  short an;\n  w = 0;\n  an = 0x294A;\n  t = ac;\n  int temp = ao - 1 + an;\n  v_int = fn2(temp, ac) & 1;\n  printf(\"checksum = %d\\n\", v_int);\n  return 0;\n}\n```",
