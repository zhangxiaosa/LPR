This is because the variable `w` is never used anywhere in the program, and its value is always `0`.\n\nWe have also applied copy propagation to the variable `an` in the assignment `an = w`. Since `w` is always `0`, we can replace `an` with `0` in the assignment.\n\nFinally, we have applied constant propagation to the expression `ao - (1 - an)` in the assignment `temp = ao - (1 - an)`. Since `an` is always `0`, we can replace `1 - an` with `1`, and then simplify the expression to `ao - 1`.\n\nThe optimized program is:\n```\nint fn2(int p1, int p2) { return p1 - p2; }\nint t;\nint v_int;\nunsigned ac = 1;\nint main() {\n  short an;\n  an = 0x294A;\n  t = ac || (an = 0);\n  short ao = 0xBCD1;\n  int temp = ao - 1;\n  v_int = fn2(temp, t) & 1;\n  printf(\"checksum = %d\\n\", v_int);\n  return 0;\n}\n```\nNote that the optimized program has the same behavior as the original program, but it is more efficient because it avoids unnecessary computations and memory accesses.",
