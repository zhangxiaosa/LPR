Therefore, we can safely remove it from the program without affecting its functionality.\n\nHere is the optimized program:\n```\nint fn2(int p1, int p2) { return p1 - p2; }\nint t;\nint v_int;\nshort w;\nint main() {\n  short an;\n  w = 0;\n  an = 0x294A;\n  t = an = w;\n  short ao = 0xBCD1;\n  if (fn2(ao - (1 - an), t) & 1)\n    v_int = 1;\n  printf(\"checksum = %d\\n\", v_int);\n  return 0;\n}\n```\nAs you can see, the variable `ac` has been removed from the program, and the `unsigned` keyword has been removed from the declaration of the variable `an`.\n\nThis optimization has improved the readability and maintainability of the program, and has also reduced the number of variables that need to be tracked and managed by the compiler.",
