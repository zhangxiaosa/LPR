In this optimized program, we have eliminated the variable `ao` by replacing it with the constant `1` in the expression `ao - (1 - an)`. This is because the value of `ao` is always equal to `1` in the given program, so we can replace it with the constant `1` without changing the behavior of the program.

We have also applied copy propagation to the variable `an` by replacing it with the expression `w` in the expression `an = w`. This is because the value of `an` is always equal to `w` in the given program, so we can replace it with the expression `w` without changing the behavior of the program.

Finally, we have eliminated the variable `temp` by replacing it with the expression `ao - 1` in the expression `temp = ao - (1 - an)`. This is because the value of `temp` is always equal to `ao - 1` in the given program, so we can replace it with the expression `ao - 1` without changing the behavior of the program.

The optimized program is as follows:
