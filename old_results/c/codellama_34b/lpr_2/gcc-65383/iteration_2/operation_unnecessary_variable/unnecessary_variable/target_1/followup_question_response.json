The return statement is changed to return the value of `q_real_real`, as it is the only variable that is returned from the function.\n7. The `main` function is changed to only call the `fn2` function and return the value of `q_real_real`.\n\nThe optimized code is smaller and more efficient, as it eliminates unused variables and unnecessary statements.",
