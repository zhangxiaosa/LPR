The loop counter `i` is incremented by 5 in each iteration, and the loop condition is updated to `i < 5 * 5`. The loop bound `5` is also updated to `5 * 5`.\n\nBy unrolling the loop, we reduce the number of loop iterations by a factor of 5, which can improve the performance of the program. However, the trade-off is that the code size increases, which can affect the cache performance.
