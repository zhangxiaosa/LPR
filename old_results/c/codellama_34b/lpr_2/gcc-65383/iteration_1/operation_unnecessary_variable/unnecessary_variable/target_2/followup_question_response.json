The assignment of the value `0xC3` to `q_real` has also been removed, as it is no longer needed. The `if (h2)` statement has been left unchanged, as it is still relevant to the program's behavior. The `g` variable is still assigned the value of `r_real[0x06D7][0x06D7][0x06D7]`, as this is still a necessary operation for the program's behavior.\n\nIn summary, the optimization has removed the unused variable `q_real` and the unnecessary assignment of the value `0xC3` to it, while leaving the necessary assignment of the value of `r_real[0x06D7][0x06D7][0x06D7]` to `g` unchanged.",

Constant propagation: The value of `q_real` is always 0xC3, so it can be propagated throughout the program.\n2. Copy propagation: The variable `r_real` is never used, so it can be eliminated from the program.\n3. Dead code elimination: The loop in the function `fn2()` is infinite, so the code inside it can be eliminated.\n4. Dead store elimination: The store to `g` is never used, so it can be eliminated.\n\nThe resulting optimized program is smaller and faster, with the unused variable `q_real` eliminated and the constant propagation and copy propagation optimizations applied.",
