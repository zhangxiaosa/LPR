The value of `r_real` is known at compile-time, so we can replace it with the constant value `0x06D7L`.\n2.

Since `r_real` is a constant, we can replace the assignment to `g` with the constant value `0x06D7L`.\n\nThe optimized program is smaller and more efficient, as it eliminates the unused variable `r_real` and reduces the number of instructions.",
