The target to be optimized is `d`: This is a typedef for a long integer vector with the size of a long integer.

To decompose the program into variables with primary data types, we can use the following steps:

1. Identify the variables in the program that are of type `d`. In this case, there are two variables: `d` and `f`.
2. For each variable of type `d`, create a new variable with the same name, but with a different type. For example, we can create a new variable `c` with type `long` and a new variable `f` with type `long[sizeof(long)]`.
3. Assign the value of the original variable to the new variable using the appropriate conversion function. For example, we can use the `long_to_vector` function to convert the value of `d` to a `long[sizeof(long)]` array.
4. Use the new variables in the program instead of the original variables.

Here is the modified program with the new variables:
