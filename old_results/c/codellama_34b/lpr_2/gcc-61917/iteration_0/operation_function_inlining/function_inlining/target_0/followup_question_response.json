The function `fn1` has two parameters, `p1` and `p2`, and it returns the difference between them.\n\nThe first call site of `fn1` is in the `for` loop inside `fn3`. The loop iterates over the elements of the `m` array, and for each element, it calls `fn1` with the element and `0x4FL` as arguments. We can inline the call to `fn1` by replacing the call site with the body of the function.\n\nThe optimized code for the `for` loop in `fn3` would look like this:\n```\nfor (l = 0; l < 20; l++)\n  for (k = 0; k >= -27; k = p1 - p2)\n    p1 = p1 - o;\n```\nIn this optimized code, the call to `fn1` has been replaced with the body of the function. The two parameters `p1` and `p2` have been replaced with the actual values passed to the function, which are `p1` and `0x4FL`. The return value of the function is assigned to the variable `k`, which is then used as the index for the `m` array.\n\nThe second call site of `fn1` is in the `return` statement inside `fn2`. The function `fn2` returns the difference between its two parameters, and it calls `fn1` to compute this difference. We can inline the call to `fn1` by replacing the call site with the body of the function.\n\nThe optimized code for the `return` statement in `fn2` would look like this:\n```\nreturn p1 - p2;\n```\nIn this optimized code, the call to `fn1` has been replaced with the body of the function. The two parameters `p1` and `p2` have been replaced with the actual values passed to the function, which are `p1` and `p2`. The return value of the function is the difference between the two values.\n\nWith these optimizations, the program will be faster and more efficient, as it will no longer need to make function calls to `fn1` and `fn2`.",
