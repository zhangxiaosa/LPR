This means that the function call to `fn2` has been replaced with the contents of the `fn2` function itself. The resulting code is slightly more efficient because it avoids the overhead of a function call and return. However, it also makes the code more difficult to read and debug, so it's important to use function inlining judiciously and only when it makes sense for the specific use case.",

The `fn2` function was only called once, so it was a good candidate for inlining. By inlining the `fn2` function, we removed the overhead of the function call and made the program faster.\n\nNote that inlining can make the program larger, so it's important to consider the trade-off between code size and performance when deciding whether to inline a function. In this case, the program size increased slightly, but the performance improvement was significant.",

This eliminates the overhead of function call and return, making the program faster and more efficient.\n\nNote that inlining can only be applied when the function is small and has a single return statement. In this case, `fn2` meets these criteria, so we can safely inline it. If the function has multiple return statements or is larger, it may not be possible to inline it.",
