In the `fn2` and `fn3` functions, the variables `p1` and `p2` are not used. Therefore, we can optimize them out by constant propagation or copy propagation.\n\nBy applying constant propagation, we can replace the variables `p1` and `p2` with their corresponding constant values in the function definitions. This would simplify the functions and reduce the number of instructions.\n\nHere is the optimized program:\n```\nshort fn2(short p1, short p2) { return 0xBCD1 - 1; }\nshort fn3(short p1, short p2) { return 0xBCD1 - 1; }\nunsigned v;\nunsigned char w;\nunsigned ac = 1;\nunsigned char fn10(short, short);\nshort fn13() {\n  fn10(0, 0);\n  return 1;\n}\nunsigned char fn10(short p1, short p2) {\n  short an = 0;\n  for (w = 3; w; w--) {\n    an = 250;\n    p2 = ac || (an = w) == 0x294A85636008822D;\n    if (fn2(fn3(0xBCD1, 1 - an), p2) & 1)\n      v = 1;\n  }\n  return 3;\n}\nint main() {\n  fn13();\n  printf(\"checksum = %X\\n\", v);\n  return 0;\n}\n```\nBy applying copy propagation, we can eliminate the variables `p1` and `p2` by replacing them with their corresponding values in the function definitions. This would also simplify the functions and reduce the number of instructions.\n\nHere is the optimized program:\n```\nshort fn2(short p1, short p2) { return 0xBCD1 - 1; }\nshort fn3(short p1, short p2) { return 0xBCD1 - 1; }\nunsigned v;\nunsigned char w;\nunsigned ac = 1;\nunsigned char fn10(short, short);\nshort fn13() {\n  fn10(0, 0);\n  return 1;\n}\nunsigned char fn10(short p1, short p2) {\n  short an = 0;\n  for (w = 3; w; w--) {\n    an = 250;\n    p2 = ac || (an = w) == 0x294A85636008822D;\n    if (fn2(fn3(0xBCD1, 1 - an), p2) & 1)\n      v = 1;\n  }\n  return 3;\n}\nint main() {\n  fn13();\n  printf(\"checksum = %X\\n\", v);\n  return 0;\n}\n```\nBoth optimization techniques have the same effect on the program's behavior and performance.
