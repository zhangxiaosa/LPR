This can reduce the memory usage and improve performance.\n2. Use a constant value: If `p71` is a constant value, we can replace it with a literal value instead of using a variable. This can reduce the memory usage and improve performance.\n3. Use a smaller data type: If `p71` is not a constant value, we can use a smaller data type such as `s_char` or `unsigned char` instead of `s_short`. This can reduce the memory usage and improve performance.\n4. Avoid unnecessary calculations: We can check if there are any unnecessary calculations being performed on `p71` and remove them. This can improve performance and reduce memory usage.\n5. Use a more efficient algorithm: If the algorithm used to calculate `p71` is inefficient, we can try to optimize it or use a more efficient algorithm.

In this case, we see that `p71` is computed based on the values of `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `p4`, which are all of type `s_short`.\n2. Determine the range of values that `p71` can take. In this case, we see that `p71` is computed using a combination of addition and subtraction operations, and it is always non-negative. Therefore, we can assume that `p71` is in the range of 0 to 65535.\n3. Choose a data type that can represent the range of values of `p71`. In this case, we can use a 16-bit unsigned integer, which can represent values in the range of 0 to 65535.\n4. Modify the code to use the new data type. In this case, we can modify the declaration of `p71` to use the new data type: `u_short p71 = 0;`\n5.
