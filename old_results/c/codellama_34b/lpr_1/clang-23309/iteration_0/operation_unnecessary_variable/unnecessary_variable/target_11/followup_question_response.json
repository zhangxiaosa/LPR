Therefore, we can optimize out the first parameter by passing a constant `0` as the first argument to `fn10`.\n\nThe function `fn11` is not used in the program, so it can be removed.\n\nThe variable `v` is assigned a value of `1` in the function `fn13`, but it is not used anywhere else in the program. Therefore, we can optimize out the assignment by removing the assignment statement.\n\nThe variable `w` is assigned a value of `3` in the function `fn10`, but it is not used anywhere else in the program. Therefore, we can optimize out the assignment by removing the assignment statement.\n\nThe variable `ab` is assigned a value of `ac`, but it is not used anywhere else in the program. Therefore, we can optimize out the assignment by removing the assignment statement.\n\nThe variable `ac` is assigned a value of `1`, but it is not used anywhere else in the program. Therefore, we can optimize out the assignment by removing the assignment statement.\n\nThe function `fn13` is not used in the program, so it can be removed.\n\nThe function `fn9` is not used in the program, so it can be removed.\n\nThe function `main` can be optimized by removing the call to `fn13` and the call to `fn9`, since they are not used in the program.\n\nAfter these optimizations, the final program is:\n```\nvoid fn1(short p1, int p2) { printf(\"checksum = %X\\n\", p1); }\nshort fn2(short p1, short p2) { return p1 - p2; }\nshort fn3(short p1, short p2) { return p1 - p2; }\nshort fn5(short p1, short p2) { return p2; }\nshort fn6(short p1, short p2) { return p1 - p2; }\nvoid fn10(short, short);\nunsigned char fn10(short p1, short p2) {\n  short al = 3;\n  short an;\n  for (an = 250; an; an--) {\n    if (fn2(fn3(0xBCD1, fn6(1, an)), p2) & 1)\n      v = 1;\n  }\n  return al;\n}\nint main() {\n  fn1(p, 0);\n  return 0;\n}\n```",
