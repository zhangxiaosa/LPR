However, the `p2` parameter is not used anywhere in the function body. Therefore, we can safely remove it from the function signature and the function body.\n\nHere's the optimized version of `fn11`:\n```c\nunsigned char fn11(unsigned char, short);\n```\nNow, let's take a look at the call site of `fn11`:\n```c\nfn11(0xBCD1, fn6(1, an));\n```\nIn this call, the `p2` parameter is passed as an argument, but it's not used in the function body. Therefore, we can remove it from the call site as well.\n\nHere's the optimized version of the call site:\n```c\nfn11(0xBCD1, fn6(1));\n```\nFinally, let's take a look at the `fn6` function:\n```c\nshort fn6(short p1, short p2) {\n  return p1 - p2;\n}\n```\nIn this function, the `p2` parameter is also not used, so we can remove it from the function signature and the function body.\n\nHere's the optimized version of `fn6`:\n```c\nshort fn6(short p1) {\n  return p1;\n}\n```\nWith these optimizations, we've successfully removed the unused `p2` parameter from the program.",
