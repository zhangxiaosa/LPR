This is not allowed in C, as a `typedef` can only be defined once for a given type. To fix this, you need to remove one of the `typedef`s.\n\nSecond, the function `fn10` is defined twice, once with the signature `u_char fn10(s_short, s_short)` and once with the signature `u_char fn10(u_char, u_char)`. This is not allowed in C, as a function cannot be defined with the same name and signature twice. To fix this, you need to remove one of the definitions.\n\nThird, the function `fn11` is defined twice, once with the signature `u_char fn11(u_char, s_short, s_short, s_short)` and once with the signature `u_char fn11(u_char, u_char, u_char, u_char)`. This is not allowed in C, as a function cannot be defined with the same name and signature twice. To fix this, you need to remove one of the definitions.\n\nFourth, the function `fn12` is defined twice, once with the signature `u_char fn12(s_short, s_short, u_char, s_short, s_short)` and once with the signature `u_char fn12(u_char, u_char, u_char, u_char, u_char)`. This is not allowed in C, as a function cannot be defined with the same name and signature twice. To fix this, you need to remove one of the definitions.\n\nFifth, the function `fn13` is defined twice, once with the signature `s_short fn13()` and once with the signature `u_char fn13()`. This is not allowed in C, as a function cannot be defined with the same name and signature twice. To fix this, you need to remove one of the definitions.\n\nSixth, the function `fn9` is defined twice, once with the signature `void fn9(s_short, char*, int)` and once with the signature `void fn9(u_char, char*, int)`. This is not allowed in C, as a function cannot be defined with the same name and signature twice. To fix this, you need to remove one of the definitions.\n\nSeventh, the function `fn1` is defined twice, once with the signature `void fn1(s_short, int)` and once with the signature `void fn1(u_char, int)`. This is not allowed in C, as a function cannot be defined with the same name and signature twice. To fix this, you need to remove one of the definitions.\n\nLastly, the variable `p` is defined twice, once as `s_short` and once as `u_char`. This is not allowed in C, as a variable cannot be defined with the same name and type twice.
