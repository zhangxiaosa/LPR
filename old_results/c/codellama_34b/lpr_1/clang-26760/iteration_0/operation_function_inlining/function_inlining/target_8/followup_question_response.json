The function `n()` is defined on line 16 of the program, and it simply returns the value of the global variable `g`.\n\nTo perform the inlining, we have replaced the function call `n()` on line 23 of the program with the actual code of the function, which is simply `return g;`. This has eliminated the function call and the overhead associated with it, and has improved the performance of the program.\n\nNote that inlining is a powerful optimization technique that can significantly improve the performance of a program.

The program is also easier to read and understand, as the function body of `n` is now directly visible within the loop.",
