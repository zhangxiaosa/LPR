This has eliminated the overhead of a function call, which can improve performance.\n\nThe function `i()` was defined on line 7 of the program, and its body has been copied into the `main()` function starting on line 13. The function `i()` takes no arguments and returns a value of type `e`.\n\nNote that the optimized program is functionally equivalent to the original program, but it has a different structure. The optimized program has a single function, `main()`, which contains the entire logic of the program. The `i()` function has been inlined, which means that its body has been copied into the `main()` function. This has eliminated the need for a separate function call, which can improve performance.",

It is defined on line 7 of the program.\n\nThe optimized function `optimize_i` is a loop that takes the value of `g` as an input, and repeatedly shifts it to the left by the value of `m` until the result is 0. The final result is the value of `k`.\n\nThe `main` function has been modified to call the optimized function `optimize_i` instead of the original function. The `main` function now only needs to assign the result of `optimize_i` to the variable `k` and check if the variable `i` is non-zero. If `i` is non-zero, the `main` function will execute the loop again.\n\nThe optimization has reduced the number of operations required to compute the value of `k` by eliminating the unnecessary loop and reducing the number of shifts required.",
