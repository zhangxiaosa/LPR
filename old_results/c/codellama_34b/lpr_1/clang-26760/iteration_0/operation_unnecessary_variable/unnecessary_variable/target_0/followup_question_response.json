The variable `i` is assigned the value of `n`, which is a constant, so the variable `i` can be optimized out.\n4. The variable `k` is assigned the value of `k >> 1L`, which is a constant, so the variable `k` can be optimized out.\n5. The variable `j` is assigned the value of `0x24F96B7BL`, which is a constant, so the variable `j` can be optimized out.\n6. The variable `n` is assigned the value of `g`, which is a constant, so the variable `n` can be optimized out.\n7.
