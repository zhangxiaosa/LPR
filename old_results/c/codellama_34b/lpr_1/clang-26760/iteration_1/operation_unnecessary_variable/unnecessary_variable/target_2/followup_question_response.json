Therefore, `n` can be optimized out and replaced with `g` in the `while` loop.\n* The variable `f` is not used in the program, so it can be optimized out.\n* The variable `j` is only used in the inner `for` loop, and its value is not modified in the loop. Therefore, the value of `j` can be propagated out of the loop and used directly in the initialization of the `k` variable.\n\nThe optimized program is functionally equivalent to the original program, but it has been simplified by eliminating unused variables and reducing the number of operations.",
