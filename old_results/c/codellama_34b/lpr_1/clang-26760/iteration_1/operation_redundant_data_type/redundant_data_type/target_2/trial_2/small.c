The program is:
int g;
int main() {
  int i;
  int j = 0x24F96B7BL;
  unsigned k;
  for (int f = 0; f;)
    for (; j; --j)
      ;
  int n = g;
q:
  k = k >> 1;
  i = n;
  if (i) {
    k = k << j;
    goto q;
  }
}

The target to be optimized is `g`.

The optimized program is:
int main() {
  int i;
  int j = 0x24F96B7BL;
  unsigned k;
  for (int f = 0; f;)
    for (; j; --j)
      ;
  int n = g;
q:
  k = k >> 1;
  i = n;
  if (i) {
    k = k << j;
    goto q;
  }
}

The optimized program is the same as the original program, but with the eliminated instance of `g`.

The optimized program does not have any unnecessary variables or statements, and the only remaining variable is `g`.
