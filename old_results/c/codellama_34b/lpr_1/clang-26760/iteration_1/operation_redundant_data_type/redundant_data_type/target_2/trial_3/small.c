The target to be optimized is `g`.

After analysis, we can see that the program has several issues:

1. The variable `g` is not used in the program.
2. The variable `i` is not used in the program.
3. The variable `j` is not used in the program.
4. The variable `k` is not used in the program.
5. The variable `n` is not used in the program.
6. The variable `f` is not used in the program.
7. The loop `for (int f = 0; f;)` is infinite and will never terminate.
8. The loop `for (; j; --j)` is infinite and will never terminate.
9. The variable `q` is not used in the program.
10. The `goto` statement is not used in the program.

Based on the above analysis, we can conclude that the program is not optimal and can be simplified.

Here is the optimized program:
