The given program has several instances of the `int` data type, which is the target to be optimized. To eliminate the `int` data type and substitute it with its associated original data type, we can use the following steps:

1. Identify the instances of `int` in the program and determine their associated original data types.
2. Replace each instance of `int` with its associated original data type.
3. Test the modified program to ensure that it produces the same results as the original program.

Here is the modified program with the `int` data type eliminated and substituted with its associated original data types:
