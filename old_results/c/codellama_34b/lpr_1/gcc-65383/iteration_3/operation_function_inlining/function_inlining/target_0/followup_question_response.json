Therefore, we can safely inline the function and eliminate the call to `fn2`.\n\nThe body of `fn2` is a loop that initializes an array `r` and then returns a value based on the value of `h0`. Since `h0` is a constant, we can evaluate the expression `r[0x06D7][0x06D7][0x06D7]` at compile-time and eliminate the loop.\n\nThe resulting program is smaller and simpler, and it avoids the overhead of function calls and memory allocation for the array.",

This eliminates the need to call `fn2` and return a value, which reduces the overhead of function calls.\n\nWe have also replaced the variable `h0` with the constant `0x92A1D2CD`, which is the value that `h0` is initialized with in the original program. This allows us to remove the initialization of `h0` and the `if` statement that checks its value.\n\nFinally, we have replaced the array access `r[0x06D7][0x06D7][0x06D7]` with the equivalent constant `0xC3`, which is the value that the array access would have produced in the original program. This allows us to remove the array access and the `for` loop.",

Therefore, the loop can be removed, and the function can be reduced to a single return statement.\n\nTo optimize the program, we can use the inline function feature of C++. By marking the function as inline, the compiler will not generate a separate function call for the function, but instead will inline the function body into the calling code. This can reduce the overhead of function calls and improve the performance of the program.\n\nIn this case, we can inline the `fn2` function in the `main` function. We can do this by adding the `inline` keyword before the function definition. The optimized program will then look like this:\n```\n#include <iostream>\n\nint g;\nint h0 = 0x92A1D2CD;\n\ninline int fn2() {\n  for (;;) {\n    int r[5][9][5];\n    if (h0)\n      return 0xC3;\n    g = r[0x06D7][0x06D7][0x06D7];\n  }\n}\n\nint main() {\n  fn2();\n  return 0;\n}\n```\nNote that the optimized program still contains a loop with no visible side effects, but it is now inlined into the `main` function. This can improve the performance of the program by reducing the overhead of function calls.",
