We can do this by creating a new array `h_new` that contains the same values as `h`, but with each element stored as a separate variable.\n\nHere is the optimized program:\n```\nint g;\nlong h_new[3];\nstatic long i = 0x06D7L;\n\nint fn2() {\n  for (;;) {\n    int q = 0xC3L;\n    int r[5][9][5];\n    if (h_new[2])\n      return q;\n    g = r[i][i][i];\n  }\n}\n\nint main() { fn2(); }\n```\nIn this optimized program, we have replaced the array `h` with the array `h_new`, which contains the same values as `h` but with each element stored as a separate variable. This allows us to avoid the overhead of accessing the elements of `h` through pointers, which can be slower and more complex than accessing the elements of `h_new` directly.\n\nNote that we have also replaced the variable `h` with `h_new` in the `fn2` function, so that the function uses the optimized version of `h`.",
