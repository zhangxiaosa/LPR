Since the variable `r` is not used outside of the function `fn2`, it can be optimized out by constant propagation or copy propagation.\n\nOne way to optimize out the variable `r` is to replace it with a constant value that is calculated at compile-time. For example, we can replace the array `r` with a constant array `c` that has the same values as `r`, but is defined at compile-time. This can be done using the following code:\n```\n<SYS>\n\nint g;\nint h0 = 0x92A1D2CD;\nint fn2() {\n  for (;;) {\n    int c[5][9][5] = {\n      { {0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04, 0x05},\n        {0x06, 0x07, 0x08, 0x09, 0x0A},\n        {0x0B, 0x0C, 0x0D, 0x0E, 0x0F},\n        {0x10, 0x11, 0x12, 0x13, 0x14},\n        {0x15, 0x16, 0x17, 0x18, 0x19}\n      },\n      { {0x20, 0x21, 0x22, 0x23, 0x24},\n        {0x25, 0x26, 0x27, 0x28, 0x29},\n        {0x2A, 0x2B, 0x2C, 0x2D, 0x2E},\n        {0x30, 0x31, 0x32, 0x33, 0x34},\n        {0x35, 0x36, 0x37, 0x38, 0x39}\n      },\n      { {0x40, 0x41, 0x42, 0x43, 0x44},\n        {0x45, 0x46, 0x47, 0x48, 0x49},\n        {0x4A, 0x4B, 0x4C, 0x4D, 0x4E},\n        {0x50, 0x51, 0x52, 0x53, 0x54},\n        {0x55, 0x56, 0x57, 0x58, 0x59}\n      },\n      { {0x60, 0x61, 0x62, 0x63, 0x64},\n        {0x65, 0x66, 0x67, 0x68, 0x69},\n        {0x6A, 0x6B, 0x6C, 0x6D, 0x6E},\n        {0x70, 0x71, 0x72, 0x73, 0x74},\n        {0x75, 0x76, 0x77, 0x78, 0x79}\n      },\n      { {0x80, 0x81, 0x82, 0x83, 0x84},\n        {0x85, 0x86, 0x87, 0x88, 0x89},\n        {0x8A, 0x8B, 0x8C, 0x8D, 0x8E},\n        {0x90, 0x91, 0x92, 0x93, 0x94},\n        {0x95, 0x96, 0x97, 0x98, 0x99}\n      }\n    };\n    if (h0)\n      return 0xC3;\n    int i = 0x06D7;\n    g = c[i][i][i];\n  }\n}\nint main() { fn2(); }\n\n</SYS>\n```\nIn this optimized code, the array `c` is defined at compile-time and is used in place of the array `r`. This eliminates the need to allocate memory for the array `r` at runtime, which can improve performance.\n\nAnother way to optimize out the variable `r` is to use copy propagation. This involves replacing the array `r` with a copy of itself, which can be done using the following code:\n```\n<SYS>\n\nint g;\nint h0 = 0x92A1D2CD;\nint fn2() {\n  for (;;) {\n    int r[5][9][5];\n    if (h0)\n      return 0xC3;\n    int i = 0x06D7;\n    g = r[i][i][i];\n  }\n}\nint main() { fn2(); }\n\n</SYS>\n```\nIn this optimized code, the array `r` is replaced with a copy of itself, which is calculated at compile-time. This eliminates the need to allocate memory for the array `r` at runtime, which can improve performance.\n\nBoth of these optimizations can be applied to the program to optimize out the variable `r`. The choice of which optimization to use will depend on the specific requirements of the program and the constraints of the target platform.",
