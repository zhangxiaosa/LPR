The program has been optimized by eliminating the duplicate definition of `i` and substituting it with its original data type `int`. The optimized program is now:

#include <stdio.h>

int g;
int h0 = 0x92A1D2CD;
static int i = 0x06D7;

int fn2() {
  for (;;) {
    int r[5][9][5];
    if (h0)
      return 0xC3;
    g = r[i][i][i];
  }
}

int main() { fn2(); }
