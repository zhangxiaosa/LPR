The `fn1` function is now defined as an inline function, which means that its code is inserted directly into the code of the calling function, rather than being called as a separate function. This can improve performance by reducing the overhead of function calls, but it also increases the size of the code.\n\nIn this case, the `fn1` function is only called once in the `main` function, so inlining it does not significantly increase the size of the code. However, if the `fn1` function were called multiple times, inlining it could potentially increase the size of the code and reduce performance.\n\nIt's worth noting that function inlining is not always the best optimization strategy. In some cases, it may be more efficient to leave the function as a separate function and call it as needed. The best approach will depend on the specifics of the situation and the goals of the optimization.",

This means that the body of the `fn1` function is now directly included in the `main` function, and the `fn1` function is no longer a separate entity. This can improve performance by reducing the overhead of function calls.\n\nNote that I've also removed the `goto` statement, as it is not necessary in this context. The `if` statement can be used to directly jump to the appropriate block of code depending on the value of `f.e`.\n\nI hope this helps!
