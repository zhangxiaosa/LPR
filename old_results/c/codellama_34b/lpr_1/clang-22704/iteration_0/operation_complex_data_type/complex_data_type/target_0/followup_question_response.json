        "content": "  To decompose the program into variables with primary data types, we can start by identifying the variables with complex data types and breaking them down into their constituent parts.\n\nIn this case, the only complex data type is the `struct c` type, which has two members: `d` and `e`. We can decompose this structure into two separate variables, `d` and `e`, each with a primary data type of `int`.\n\nHere is the decomposed program:\n```\ntypedef char b;\nint d;\nint e;\n\nb fn1() {\n  int h = 6L;\n  if (e)\n    goto i;\n  fn1();\n  b j;\n  return j;\ni:\n  d = h;\n  fn1();\n  j = 0xEEACFBBFL;\n  return j;\n}\n\nint main() {}\n```\nIn this decomposed program, the `struct c` type has been replaced with two separate `int` variables, `d` and `e`. The `f` variable, which was previously a `struct c` type, has been replaced with the two variables `d` and `e`. The `fn1` function has been modified accordingly to use the new variables.\n\nThe target of optimization, `f`, has been replaced with the two variables `d` and `e`.",
