The target to be optimized is for (xxx) {.

The given program has a loop in the function `fn1` that is executed for a fixed number of iterations. The loop can be optimized out by unrolling it, which means duplicating the loop body multiple times and removing the loop entirely.

Here's the optimized version of the program:
