Given the following program and the variable in complex data type, decompose the it into variables with primary data type.. The program is 
int d;
int e;
int fn1(h) {
  if (e == 0)
    goto i;
  fn1(h);
  return 0xEEACFBBFL;
i:
  d = h;
  fn1(h);
  return 0xEEACFBBFL;
}
int main() {}
.                 The target to be optimized is `fn1` is a function that takes a pointer to an integer as an argument and returns an integer.

The program can be optimized by decomposing the complex data type variable `h` into primitive data type variables. The optimized program is as follows:
