We can replace all occurrences of `temp` with `0xEEACFBBFL`.\n\nSecond, we can apply copy propagation to the `h` variable, which is passed as a pointer to `fn1` and is never modified inside `fn1`. We can replace all occurrences of `h` with the value of `*h`, which is the value pointed to by `h`.\n\nHere is the optimized program:\n```\nint fn1(int *h) {\n  if (e) {\n    *h = 0xEEACFBBFL;\n    fn1(h);\n    return 0xEEACFBBFL;\n  }\n  fn1(h);\n  return 0xEEACFBBFL;\n}\n\nint main() {}\n```\nIn this optimized program, the `temp` variable has been eliminated, and the `h` variable has been replaced with the value pointed to by `h` wherever it appears.

However, the value of `temp` is never used anywhere else in the program, so we can optimize it out by replacing all occurrences of `temp` with its value. This is known as constant propagation.\n\nIn addition, the variable `h` is passed as an argument to the function `fn1`, but its value is not used anywhere in the function. Therefore, we can also optimize it out by replacing all occurrences of `h` with the value it is passed. This is known as copy propagation.\n\nThe resulting optimized program does not contain any unnecessary variables or function calls, making it more efficient and easier to understand.",
