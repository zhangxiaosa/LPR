We then use `temp` to store the value at the address pointed to by `h`, and return the value of `temp` at the end of the function. This approach allows us to avoid using the pointer `h` directly, which can make the code easier to read and reason about.\n\nNote that this optimization is only possible because the function `fn1` does not modify the value of `h` after it is called. If the function were to modify the value of `h`, then this optimization would not be valid.",
