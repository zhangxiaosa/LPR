Here, we have decomposed the `d` typedef into a primary data type `long` and a vector size attribute. We have also defined a function `fn1` that takes no arguments and returns a `d` value. The `main` function calls `fn1` and assigns the returned value to a variable of type `d`.

The optimized version of the program that uses the `d` typedef is as follows:
