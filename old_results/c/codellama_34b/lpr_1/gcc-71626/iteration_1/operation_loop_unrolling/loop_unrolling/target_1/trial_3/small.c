The optimized program has the same functionality as the original program, but with the loop unrolled. The loop has been replaced with a sequence of statements that perform the same operations as the loop, but without the overhead of the loop construct.

In this case, the loop was unrolled by a factor of 2, which means that the loop body was executed twice for each iteration of the loop. This has reduced the number of iterations of the loop from n/2 to n, where n is the number of iterations of the original loop.

The optimized program has improved performance by reducing the number of iterations of the loop, and by eliminating the overhead of the loop construct.
