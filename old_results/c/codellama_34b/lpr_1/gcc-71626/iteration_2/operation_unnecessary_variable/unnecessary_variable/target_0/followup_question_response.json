Instead, the function `fn2` returns the result of calling `fn1` directly, without storing it in a variable.

Here is the optimized program:\n```\ntypedef long d __attribute__((__vector_size__(sizeof(long))));\nfn2() {}\nmain() {}\n```\nAs you can see, the variable `d` has been removed from the program, and the function `fn2` has been simplified to return a null value.\n\nBy applying constant propagation and copy propagation, we were able to optimize out the variable `d`, which was not used in the program.

The expression `{fn1}` has been replaced with a constant `{0}`, which is the value of the `d` vector when it is initialized with the `fn1` function.\n\nNote that the `fn1` function is not used in the optimized program, so it can be removed as well.
