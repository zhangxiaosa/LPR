Define a new type `d_primitive` that is a structure containing the fields of `d` as primary data types.\n2. Define a function `d_to_d_primitive` that takes a value of type `d` as input and returns a value of type `d_primitive`.\n3.

We can then perform the calculations on each part separately and reassemble the `f` variable at the end.
