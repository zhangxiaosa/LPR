Given the following program and the variable in complex data type, decompose the it into variables with primary data type.. The program is fn1() {}
typedef long d __attribute__((__vector_size__(sizeof(long))));
d fn2() {
  long c = fn1;
  d f = {c};
  return f;
}
main() {}

The target to be optimized is `f`: This is a variable of type `d`, which is a complex data type.

Therefore, the list of variables with complex data types is:

* `f`: A variable of type `d`, which is a complex data type.

To decompose the variable `f` into variables with primary data type, we can use the following steps:

1. Break down the complex data type `d` into its constituent parts. In this case, `d` is a vector of `long` values, so we can break it down into individual `long` values.
2. Declare new variables for each of the constituent parts of the complex data type. In this case, we can declare a new variable `c` of type `long` to represent the first element of the vector `f`.
3. Assign the value of the complex data type variable `f` to the new variables. In this case, we can assign the value of `f` to `c`.
4. Use the new variables in the program instead of the original complex data type variable. In this case, we can use `c` instead of `f` in the program.

Here is the decomposed program:
