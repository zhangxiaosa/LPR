Given the following program and the variable in complex data type, decompose the it into variables with primary data type.. The program is fn1() {}
typedef long d __attribute__((__vector_size__(sizeof(long))));
d fn2() {
  long c = fn1;
  d f = {c};
  return f;
}
main() {}

The target to be optimized is `f`: This is a variable of type `d`, which is a complex data type.

Therefore, the list of variables with complex data types is:

* `f`

The whole final program as required is:
