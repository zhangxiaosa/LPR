This means that the function `fn2` is no longer a separate function, but rather it is part of the `main` function.\n\nThe optimization was done by replacing the call to `fn2` in the `main` function with the body of the `fn2` function. This way, the function call overhead is eliminated, and the program runs faster.\n\nNote that inlining can only be done if the function being inlined is small and has a single exit point. If the function being inlined has multiple exit points or is too large, it may not be possible to inline it.",

This is done by removing the `fn2` function definition and replacing it with a macro definition. The macro definition is then used in the `main` function to call `fn1` and assign the result to `c`. The rest of the code in `fn2` is then moved into the `main` function, resulting in a simpler and more efficient program.",

Additionally, the use of the `d` type to hold the result of `fn2` has been removed, as it is no longer necessary. The program can now be compiled and run without errors.",

The `fn2` function is inlined in the `main` function, and the `fn1` function is also inlined in the `main` function. This reduces the number of function calls and improves the performance of the program.",
