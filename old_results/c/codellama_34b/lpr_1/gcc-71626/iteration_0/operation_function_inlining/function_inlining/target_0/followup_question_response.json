The resulting program is simpler and more efficient, as the function call to `fn1` is eliminated and the code is directly inlined into the function `fn2`.\n\nNote that this optimization is only possible because the function `fn1` has no side effects and does not depend on any external state.

The optimization was done by replacing the call to `fn1` with the body of `fn1`, which is simply `return 0;`. This eliminates the overhead of a function call and improves the performance of the program.\n\nNote that the `__attribute__((__vector_size__(sizeof(a))))` is a GCC-specific extension that is used to specify the size of the vector.
