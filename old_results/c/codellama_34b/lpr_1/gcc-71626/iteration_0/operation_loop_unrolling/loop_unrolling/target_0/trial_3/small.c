The given program is a simple C program that defines a function `fn1` and a function `fn2` that takes no arguments and returns a vector of type `d`. The function `fn2` calls `fn1` and assigns the result to a variable `c` of type `a`. It then creates a vector `f` of type `d` and initializes it with the value of `c`. Finally, it returns `f`.

To optimize the program, we can use loop unrolling to eliminate the loop and improve performance. Here is an optimized version of the program:
