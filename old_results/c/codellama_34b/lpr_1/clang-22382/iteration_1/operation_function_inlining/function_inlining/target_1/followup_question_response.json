This eliminates the function call overhead and reduces the number of instructions in the program. However, it is important to note that this optimization may not always be possible or desirable, as it can also increase the size of the code and potentially reduce readability.",

The resulting code is equivalent to the original code, but with the call to `fn1` replaced with the body of `fn1`.\n\nNote that inlining can be done only if the function being inlined is small and has no side effects. In this case, `fn1` is a simple function with no side effects, so it is safe to inline it.",

The resulting code is functionally equivalent to the original code, but with the overhead of the function call removed.\n\nNote that the `goto` statement in `fn1` has been replaced with a `w` label, which is a valid label in C++. This is because the `goto` statement is not necessary in the optimized code, as the function can simply return to the top of the loop.",
