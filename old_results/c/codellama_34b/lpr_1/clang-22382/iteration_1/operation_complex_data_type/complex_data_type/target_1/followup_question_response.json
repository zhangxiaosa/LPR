The `fn1` function has been modified to take a `struct h` argument, and the fields of the structure are accessed directly using the new variables. The `fn2` function has been modified to call `fn1` with a `struct h` argument, and the `for` loop has been removed since it is no longer needed.\n\nThe target to be optimized, `p` of type `struct h`, has been decomposed into three separate variables: `i`, `j`, and `k`.
