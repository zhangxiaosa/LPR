The function body consists of a single statement: `p5.k`, which is a no-op.\n* The `fn2` function takes no arguments and returns a `long`. The function body consists of two statements: `struct h p;` and `int q;`. The `p` variable is not used, so it can be optimized out. The `q` variable is never initialized or used, so it can also be optimized out.\n* The `main` function takes no arguments and returns an `int`. The function body is empty, so it can be optimized out.\n\nThe optimized program would look like this:\n```\nstruct h {\n  signed i;\n  long j;\n  unsigned k;\n};\nstatic struct h fn1(struct h p5) {\n  p5.k;\nw:;\n  goto w;\n}\nint main() {}\n```\nNote that the `fn2` function has been removed, as it was not used by the `main` function.
