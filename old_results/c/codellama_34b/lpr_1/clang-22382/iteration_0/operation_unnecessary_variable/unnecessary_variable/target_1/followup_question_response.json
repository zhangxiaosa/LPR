Since the variable `p2` is an unused parameter in `fn1`, we can optimize it out by simply removing it from the function signature and the function body.\n\nHere's the optimized program:\n```\nstruct h {\n  signed i;\n  long j;\n  unsigned k;\n};\nlong l;\nstatic struct h fn1(short p3, long p4, struct h p5) {\n  p5.k;\nw:;\n  goto w;\n}\nlong fn2() {\n  struct h p;\n  int q;\n  fn1(3, p);\n  for (;;) {\n    struct h r;\n    p = r = p;\n  }\n}\nint main() {}\n```\nIn this optimized program, the variable `p2` is no longer used in `fn1`, so we can remove it from the function signature and the function body. This reduces the number of variables that need to be passed to the function, which can improve performance.\n\nAdditionally, we can optimize the `for` loop in `fn2` by using copy propagation. The variable `p` is assigned the value of `r` in each iteration, but it is never used. Therefore, we can optimize the loop by removing the assignment and simply using the value of `r` directly.\n\nHere's the final optimized program:\n```\nstruct h {\n  signed i;\n  long j;\n  unsigned k;\n};\nlong l;\nstatic struct h fn1(short p3, long p4, struct h p5) {\n  p5.k;\nw:;\n  goto w;\n}\nlong fn2() {\n  struct h p;\n  int q;\n  fn1(3, p);\n  for (;;) {\n    struct h r;\n    p = r;\n  }\n}\nint main() {}\n```\nIn this optimized program, we've removed the unnecessary assignment of `r` to `p` in the `for` loop, which can improve performance.
