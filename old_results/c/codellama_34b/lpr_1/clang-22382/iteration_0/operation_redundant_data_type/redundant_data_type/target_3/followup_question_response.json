The `goto` statement in `fn1` has been replaced with a `return` statement, as it is not necessary and can cause issues with the program's control flow.\n4. The `for` loop in `fn2` has been removed, as it is not necessary and can cause issues with the program's control flow.\n\nWith these changes, the program should be easier to read and understand, and it should also be easier to optimize for performance.",
