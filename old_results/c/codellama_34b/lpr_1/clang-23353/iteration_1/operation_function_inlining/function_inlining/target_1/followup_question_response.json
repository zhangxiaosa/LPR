This eliminates the overhead of calling a separate function and instead performs the multiplication directly within the loop.\n\nNote that the `fn1` function is only called once in the original program, so inlining it has no effect on the overall performance of the program. However, inlining can be a useful optimization technique in other cases where a function is called multiple times, as it can reduce the overhead of function calls and improve the program's overall performance.",

The inlined function `fn1` is no longer needed, so it has been removed from the program. The performance of the optimized program will be improved because the function call has been eliminated, and the memory usage of the program will be reduced because the inlined function is no longer needed.",
