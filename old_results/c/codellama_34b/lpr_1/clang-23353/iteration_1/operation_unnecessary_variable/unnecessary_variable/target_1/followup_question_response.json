Since the function `fn1` does not modify the value of its argument, we can replace the call to `fn1` with the value of the argument, which is `6`.\n3. Dead code elimination:\nThe variable `p2` is not used anywhere in the program, so it can be optimized out.\n\nThe optimized program is then:\n```\nint fn1(char p1, char p2) { return p1 * p2; }\nstruct g {\n  int h;\n};\nint i;\nstruct g j;\nint fn2(p3) {\n  for (p3 = 6; p3 != -7; p3--)\n    j.h ^= fn1(6, i) && 1L;\n  return 0;\n}\nint main() { return 0; }\n```",
