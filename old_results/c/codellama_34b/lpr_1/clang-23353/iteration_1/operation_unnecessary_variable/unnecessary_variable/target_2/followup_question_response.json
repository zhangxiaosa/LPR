The expression `fn1(p3, i) && 1L` has been simplified to `fn1(p3, i)`, since the `&&` operator with a constant on the right-hand side is redundant.\n\nIt's worth noting that the optimization of the program has changed the semantics of the original program. The original program had a loop that executed 6 times, but the optimized program has an infinite loop that never terminates. This is because the value of `p3` is never changed within the loop, so the loop condition `p3 != -7` will always be true.",
