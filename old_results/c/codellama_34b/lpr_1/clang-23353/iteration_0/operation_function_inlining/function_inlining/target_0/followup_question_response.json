The `fn1` function was called with the parameters `p3` and `i`, and the result was used in the expression `j.h ^= fn1(p3, i) && 1L;`. This expression has been replaced with the inlined version of `fn1`, which is simply `j.h ^= (p3 * i) && 1L;`.\n\nThe optimized program should run faster and use less memory, since the function call and return overhead of `fn1` has been eliminated.",

This eliminates the function call overhead and may improve performance, depending on the specific circumstances.\n\nNote that the program still contains the `fn1` function signature, but it is no longer defined as a separate function.
