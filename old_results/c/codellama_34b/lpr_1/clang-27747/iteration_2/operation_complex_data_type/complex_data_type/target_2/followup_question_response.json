The struct itself has been replaced with separate variables for each member. The target `struct c l;` has been optimized by removing it from the program and using the individual variables instead.",

For example, the variable `l.d` can be eliminated by using the expression `i.e` directly in the assignment to `l.g`. The variable `n` can be eliminated by using the expression `i.d && l.d` directly in the assignment to `p`. The variable `p` can be eliminated by using the expression `l.d | -(l.d && l.d)` directly in the assignment to `i.g`.\n\nHere is the optimized program:\n```\nstruct c {\n  int d;\n  int e;\n  int g;\n};\n\nint main() {\n  struct c i;\n  i.d = 18;\n  i.e = 32;\n  i.g = i.e && i.d;\n  i.g = i.d | -(i.d && i.d);\n}\n```\nNote that the optimization has resulted in a smaller program with fewer variables and less code.",
