The target to be optimized is `n`.

Optimization:

After analyzing the program, it can be observed that the variable `n` is assigned the value of `i.d && l.d`, which is a constant expression. Since the variable `n` is not used anywhere in the program, it can be optimized out by replacing its usage with the constant expression `i.d && l.d`.

The optimized program is:
