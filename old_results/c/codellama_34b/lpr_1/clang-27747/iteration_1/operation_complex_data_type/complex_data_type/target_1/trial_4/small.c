Program Analysis:

The program is struct c {
  int d : 18;
  int e;
  int g;
  int h;
};
struct c i;
int main() {
  struct c l;
  int m = i.e;
  l.d = m;
  int n = i.h && l.d;
  int p = l.d | -(l.d && l.d) - n;
  i.g = p;
}

Decomposition of variables:

* i.e: an integer variable that represents the value of the member variable "e" in the struct c.
* i.d: an integer variable that represents the value of the member variable "d" in the struct c.
* i.h: an integer variable that represents the value of the member variable "h" in the struct c.
* i.g: an integer variable that represents the value of the member variable "g" in the struct c.
* l.d: an integer variable that represents the value of the member variable "d" in the struct c.
* m: an integer variable that represents the value of the member variable "e" in the struct c.
* n: an integer variable that represents the result of the logical AND operation between the values of the member variables "h" and "d" in the struct c.
* p: an integer variable that represents the result of the logical OR operation between the values of the member variables "d" and "d" in the struct c, and the negation of the result of the logical AND operation between the values of the member variables "h" and "d" in the struct c.

Optimization of the program:

The target of optimization is the variable "e", which is an integer variable that represents the value of the member variable "e" in the struct c. The optimization will be done by reducing the number of variables used in the program and by using more efficient data types.

Firstly, the variable "l" is not used in the program, so it can be removed.

Secondly, the variable "m" is only used to store the value of the member variable "e" in the struct c, so it can be replaced by the member variable "e" directly.

Thirdly, the variable "n" is only used to store the result of the logical AND operation between the values of the member variables "h" and "d" in the struct c, so it can be replaced by the result of the logical AND operation directly.

Fourthly, the variable "p" is only used to store the result of the logical OR operation between the values of the member variables "d" and "d" in the struct c, and the negation of the result of the logical AND operation between the values of the member variables "h" and "d" in the struct c, so it can be replaced by the result of the logical OR operation directly.

After the optimization, the program becomes:
