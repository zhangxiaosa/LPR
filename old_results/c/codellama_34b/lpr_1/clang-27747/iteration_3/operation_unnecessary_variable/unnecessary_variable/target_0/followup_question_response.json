Constant Propagation:\n\nIn the expression `n = i.d && l.d`, the variable `l` is not modified, so the value of `l.d` is constant and can be propagated. The expression can be simplified to `n = i.d`.\n\n2. Copy Propagation:\n\nIn the expression `p = l.d | -(l.d && l.d) - n`, the variable `l` is not modified, so the value of `l.d` can be propagated to the variable `p`. The expression can be simplified to `p = i.d`.\n\n3. Unused Variable:\n\nThe variable `n` is not used in the program, so it can be optimized out.\n\nThe optimized program is:\n```\nstruct c i;\nint main() {\n  struct c l;\n  l.d = i.d;\n  i.g = i.d;\n}\n```",
