This transformation eliminates the need to create a struct instance and access its fields, which can improve the performance of the program.\n\nIn the optimized program, the `d` and `g` variables are used directly in the expressions that were previously using the `struct c` fields. The `d` variable is used to store the value of `i.d`, and the `g` variable is used to store the value of `l.d`. The `n` variable is calculated as the logical AND of `i.d` and `l.d`, and the `p` variable is calculated as the bitwise OR of `l.d` and `-(l.d && l.d) - n`. Finally, the `i.g` field is set to the value of `p`.\n\nThe optimized program is smaller and more efficient than the original program, as it eliminates the need for a struct instance and reduces the number of operations required to perform the computations.",
