Copy propagation: The value of `m` is assigned from `i.e`, so we can eliminate the assignment and use `i.e` directly in the rest of the program. Similarly, the value of `n` is assigned from `i.h && m`, so we can eliminate the assignment and use `i.h && i.e` directly.\n\nThe optimized program has fewer instructions and does not access the `struct c` instance at all, since all the variables are known at compile-time.",
