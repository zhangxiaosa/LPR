This changes the code to:\n```\nstruct c l = {24, 6738, 165};\nint m = i.e;\nl.d = m;\nint n = i.h && 24;\nint p = 24 | -(24 && 24) - n;\ni.g = p;\n```\nFinally, we can propagate the value of l.d into the expression for p.

Therefore, it can be optimized out by constant propagation.\n2. `n` is assigned the value of `i.h && l.d`, but it is not used anywhere in the program. Therefore, it can be optimized out by constant propagation.\n3. `p` is assigned the value of `l.d | -(l.d && l.d) - n`, but `n` is not used anywhere in the program. Therefore, the expression can be simplified to `l.d | -(l.d && l.d)`.\n4. `i.g` is assigned the value of `p`, but `p` is not used anywhere in the program.
