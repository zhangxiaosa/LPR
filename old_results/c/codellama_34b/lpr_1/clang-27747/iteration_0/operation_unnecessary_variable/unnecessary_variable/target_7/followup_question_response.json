Constant Propagation:\n\nThe variable \"m\" is assigned the value of \"i.e\", which is a constant.

Copy Propagation:\n\nThe variable \"l\" is not used anywhere in the program after it is initialized.

However, `m` is not used anywhere in the program, so it can be optimized out.\n\nThe assignment `l.d = m` can also be optimized out, as it is not used anywhere in the program.\n\nThe expression `i.h && l.d` can be simplified to `i.h && 24`, since `l.d` is a constant expression.\n\nThe expression `l.d | -(l.d && l.d) - n` can be simplified to `l.d | -24 - n`, since `l.d` is a constant expression.\n\nTherefore, the optimized program is:\n```\nstruct c {\n  int d : 18;\n  int e;\n  int g;\n  int h;\n};\nstruct c i;\nint main() {\n  struct c l = {24, 6738, 165};\n  int n = i.h && 24;\n  int p = l.d | -24 - n;\n  i.g = p;\n}\n```",

The assignment to `n` is also no longer necessary, as it is not used anywhere in the program.\n\nThe optimized program can be further optimized by eliminating the struct `c` and using a simple integer variable for the field `d`. This would make the program even more efficient, but it would also make it less readable and maintainable.
