The `fn1` function's code is now part of the `main` function's code, and the `fn1` function is no longer needed.

The function `fn1` is called with the arguments `m`, `n`, and `i.d`. The function body is then inserted into the `main` function, and the function call is replaced with the inserted code.

The function `fn1` is not being used anywhere in the program, so it can be removed.\n2. The variable `l` is only being used within the scope of `fn1`, so it can be declared as a local variable within the function.\n3. The variable `m` is only being used to store the value of `j.e`, which is never modified. Therefore, we can simply use `j.e` directly instead of storing it in a variable.\n4. The variable `n` is only being used to store the result of `j.h && l.d`, which is never modified. Therefore, we can simply use `j.h && l.d` directly instead of storing it in a variable.\n5. The variable `o` is only being used to store the result of `l.d`, which is never modified. Therefore, we can simply use `l.d` directly instead of storing it in a variable.\n6. The variable `p` is only being used to store the result of `o | -(l.f && l.d) - n`, which is never modified. Therefore, we can simply use `o | -(l.f && l.d) - n` directly instead of storing it in a variable.\n\nWith these optimizations, the program can be simplified as follows:\n```\ntypedef signed a;\ntypedef int b;\nstruct c {\n  signed d : 18;\n  unsigned e;\n  unsigned f;\n  signed g;\n  signed h;\n};\nstruct c i;\nstruct c j;\n\nint main() {\n  i.g = j.e | -(j.f && j.d) - (j.h && j.d);\n}\n```\nThe resulting program is much simpler and more efficient, as it eliminates the unnecessary function call and reduces the number of variables used.",
