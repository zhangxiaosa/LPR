The program also defines a function `fn1` that takes an `int` argument and returns the same value, and a global variable `r` of type `int`. The `main` function creates an instance of the `m` structure and assigns the value `1957` to its `n` member. It then calls the `fn1` function with the value `5` as an argument and assigns the result to the `o` member of the structure. The program then assigns the value of the `o` member to the global variable `ae`, and then assigns the value of the global variable `u` to the `o` member of the structure. Finally, the program calculates the remainder of the `o` member divided by `ae` and assigns the result to the global variable `r`.\n\nThe optimized program is the same as the original program, but with the `struct m` type eliminated and replaced with its associated original data type, which is `int`. The optimized program is:\n```\nint fn1(p2) { return p2; }\nint r;\nstatic int s = -5;\nint u;\nint main() {\n  int ad = 1957;\n  ad = fn1(5);\n  int ae = ad;\n  ad = u;\n  r = ad % (~s / ae);\n}\n```\nIn this optimized program, the `struct m` type has been eliminated and replaced with the `int` type. The `ad` variable is now of type `int` instead of `struct m`, and the `ae` variable is also of type `int`. The `fn1` function still takes an `int` argument and returns the same value, and the global variable `r` is still of type `int`. The rest of the program is the same as the original program, with the `struct m` type eliminated.",
