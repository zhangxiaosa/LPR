Additionally, the `int` data type has been replaced with `unsigned int` in the `main` function.\n\nNote that the `int` data type is still used in the `main` function, but it has been replaced with `unsigned int` in the `struct` definition and the `static` variable declaration. This is because `int` and `unsigned int` are both 32-bit integer types, but `unsigned int` is unsigned, meaning it can represent positive values only. In this case, it is more appropriate to use `unsigned int` for the `s_sign` and `ae` variables, as they are used as indices into the `struct m` array.\n\nAlso, note that the `%` operator is used to compute the remainder of `ad.o` divided by `ae`, which is a positive value. Therefore, it is safe to use `unsigned int` for the `r` variable, as it will always be positive.",
