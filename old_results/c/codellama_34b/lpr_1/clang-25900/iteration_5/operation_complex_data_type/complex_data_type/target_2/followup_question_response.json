The `struct` type has been replaced with individual variables `n` and `o`, and the `static` variable `s_sign` has been replaced with a regular variable `s_sign`. The `u` variable is also a regular variable.\n\nThe only difference between the original and decompiled programs is that the decompiled program does not have the `s_unsigned` variable, since it is not used in the program. However, the decompiled program still has the same overall functionality and produces the same output as the original program.",

The static variable s_sign is also replaced with the integer variable s_sign, and the variable u is added to the program.
