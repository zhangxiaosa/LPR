Since the value of `ad.o` is always `s_unsigned`, which is a constant, we can replace `ad.o` with `s_unsigned` in the expression.\n\nAfter optimization, the program becomes:\n```\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint r;\nstatic int s_sign = -5;\nint s_unsigned = 5;\nint u;\n\nint main() {\n    int ae = s_unsigned;\n    r = s_unsigned % (~s_sign / ae);\n    return 0;\n}\n\n```\nIn this optimized program, the variable `ad` is no longer used, and the expression `ad.o % (~s_sign / ae)` has been simplified to `s_unsigned % (~s_sign / s_unsigned)`.
