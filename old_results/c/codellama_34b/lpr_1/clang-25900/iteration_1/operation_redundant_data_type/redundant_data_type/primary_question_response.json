The type of the `n` and `o` members of the `m` struct is not explicitly declared, but it can be inferred from the initializer that they are of type `signed`.\n3. The type of the `r` variable is not explicitly declared, but it can be inferred from the assignment that it is of type `int`.\n4. The type of the `s` variable is explicitly declared as `signed`, but it is initialized with a value of type `long`, which is a superset of `signed`.\n5. The type of the `u` variable is not explicitly declared, but it can be inferred from the assignment that it is of type `int`.\n6. The type of the `ae` variable is not explicitly declared, but it can be inferred from the assignment that it is of type `signed`.\n7. The type of the `af` variable is explicitly declared as `int`, but it is initialized with a value of type `signed`.\n\nTherefore, the list of redundant data types in the program is:\n\n* `unsigned` (inferred from the function signature of `fn1`)\n* `signed` (inferred from the initializer of the `m` struct)\n* `int` (inferred from the assignment to `r` and `af`)\n* `signed` (inferred from the assignment to `ae`)\n\nIt is worth noting that the redundancy of data types can also make the code harder to read and understand, as it may not be immediately clear what type a particular variable or expression has. It is generally a good practice to avoid redundant data types and to use the most specific type that accurately represents the data being represented.",
