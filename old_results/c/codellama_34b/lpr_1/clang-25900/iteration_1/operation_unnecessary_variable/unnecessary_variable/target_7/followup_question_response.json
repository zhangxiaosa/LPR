Therefore, the value of `s` can be propagated throughout the program and replaced with the constant value -5.\n2. Copy propagation: The variable `s` is only used once in the program, and that is to compute the value of `r`. Since `s` is not modified, we can replace the use of `s` with the constant value -5.\n3. Dead code elimination: The variable `u` is never used in the program, so it can be eliminated.\n\nThe optimized program has fewer instructions, which can result in faster execution and reduced memory usage.",
