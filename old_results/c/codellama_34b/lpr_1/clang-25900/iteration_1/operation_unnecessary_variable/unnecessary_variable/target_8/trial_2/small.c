Explanation:

1. The variable `u` is not used in the program, so it can be optimized out by constant propagation and copy propagation.
2. The expression `ad.o = u` can be optimized out because `u` is not used anywhere else in the program.
3. The expression `ae = ad.o` can be optimized out because `ad.o` is not used anywhere else in the program.
4. The expression `r = ae % (~s / ae)` can be optimized out because `ae` is not used anywhere else in the program.
5. The expression `ad.o` can be optimized out because it is not used anywhere else in the program.

The optimized program does not contain the variable `u` and the expressions that use it.
