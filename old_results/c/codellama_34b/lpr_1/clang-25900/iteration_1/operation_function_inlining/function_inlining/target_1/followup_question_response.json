There is no further optimization that can be done to the program as it is already in its most efficient form.\n\nThe program is already optimized because it uses function inlining, which is a technique that allows functions to be called without the overhead of a function call. In this case, the function `fn2` is inlined in the function `fn4`, which reduces the overhead of calling the function.\n\nThe program is also optimized because it uses a static variable `s` to store the value -5L, which is a constant value that is not changed during the execution of the program. This allows the compiler to optimize the code by replacing the variable `s` with the constant value -5L in the function `fn2`.\n\nOverall, the program is optimized because it uses function inlining and constant folding, which are two effective techniques for optimizing code.",
