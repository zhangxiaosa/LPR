This can be achieved by changing the declaration of `ae` to `int32_t ae = ad.o;` and then using `ae` instead of `ad.o` in the subsequent calculations.\n\nHere is the optimized program:\n```\n#include <stdint.h>\n\nuint32_t fn1(uint32_t p1, int32_t p2) { return p2; }\n\nint32_t r;\nstatic int32_t s = -5;\nint32_t u;\n\nint32_t fn4() {\n  int32_t ae = fn1(0, 5);\n  ae = u;\n  r = ae % (~s / ae);\n}\n\nint32_t main() { fn4(); }\n```\nIn this optimized program, the variable `ae` is declared as an `int32_t` and is used throughout the program instead of the `struct m` data type.

Replace the function `fn1` with a simpler function that returns the same value as `fn1` but with fewer instructions. For example, we can replace `fn1` with a function that returns `p2` directly.\n2. Replace the struct `m` with a simpler data structure that uses only the necessary fields. For example, we can replace `struct m` with a struct that only has the `n` and `o` fields.\n3. Replace the variable `s` with a constant. This will simplify the expression `~s / ae` and make it easier to optimize.\n4. Remove the variable `u` and replace it with a constant.
