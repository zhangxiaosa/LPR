Since `ae` is a constant and its value is known at compile-time, we can evaluate the expression `r = ad.o % (~s / ae)` and replace it with the result, which is `ad.o % (-5 / ae)`.\n\nFinally, we can propagate the value of `ad.o` to the expression `ad.o % (-5 / ae)`. Since `ad.o` is a constant and its value is known at compile-time, we can evaluate the expression `ad.o % (-5 / ae)` and replace it with the result, which is `1957 % (-5 / 5)`.\n\nThe optimized program is:\n```\nint fn1(p2) { return p2; }\nstruct m {\n  int n : 18;\n  int o : 1;\n};\nint r;\nstatic int s = -5;\nint u;\nint main() {\n  struct m ad = {1957};\n  ad.o = fn1(5);\n  int ae = ad.o;\n  ad.o = u;\n  r = 1957 % (-5 / 5);\n}\n```\nNote that the variable `n` is not used in the optimized program, so it can be removed.
