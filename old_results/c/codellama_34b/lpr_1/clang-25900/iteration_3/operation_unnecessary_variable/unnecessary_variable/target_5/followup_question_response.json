This can be done using copy propagation.\n\nHere is the optimized program:\n```\nint fn1(p2) { return p2; }\nstruct m {\n  int n : 18;\n  int o : 1;\n};\nint r;\nstatic int s = -5;\nint main() {\n  struct m ad = {1957};\n  ad.o = fn1(5);\n  int ae = ad.o;\n  ad.o = 5;\n  r = ad.o % (~s / ae);\n}\n```\nIn this optimized program, the variable `u` has been replaced with its initial value of `5` throughout the program. This has eliminated the need for the variable `u`, and the program is now more efficient and easier to understand.\n\nAnother optimization that can be done is to eliminate the function `fn1`, which is not used in the program. This can be done by inlining the function and removing the function call.\n\nHere is the optimized program with the function `fn1` eliminated:\n```\nstruct m {\n  int n : 18;\n  int o : 1;\n};\nint r;\nstatic int s = -5;\nint main() {\n  struct m ad = {1957};\n  ad.o = 5;\n  int ae = ad.o;\n  ad.o = 5;\n  r = ad.o % (~s / ae);\n}\n```\nIn this optimized program, the function `fn1` has been inlined and the function call has been removed. This has eliminated the need for the function `fn1` and has made the program more efficient.\n\nOverall, the program has been optimized by eliminating unused variables and functions, and by inlining functions to reduce the number of function calls. This has improved the efficiency and readability of the program.",
