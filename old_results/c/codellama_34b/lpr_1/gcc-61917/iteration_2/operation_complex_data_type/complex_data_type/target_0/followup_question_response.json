This allows the compiler to optimize the loop and avoid the unnecessary overhead of incrementing and comparing `k` on each iteration.\n\nWe have also removed the `l` variable, as it is not used in the optimized version of the program.\n\nThe resulting program is:\n```\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint fn2(int p1_int, int p2_int) {\n  return p1_int - p2_int;\n}\n\nint main() {\n  int result = fn2(10, 27);\n  printf(\"Result: %d\\n\", result);\n  return 0;\n}\n```\nThis optimized program should run faster than the original program, as it avoids the unnecessary overhead of incrementing and comparing `k` on each iteration, and it removes the unused `l` variable.",
