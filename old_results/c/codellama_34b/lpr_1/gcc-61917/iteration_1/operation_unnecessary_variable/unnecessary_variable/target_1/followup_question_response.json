Constant propagation was applied to the loop bounds in `fn3`. The value of `k` is initialized to 0 and decreased by 6 in each iteration. Since the loop condition is `k >= -27`, the loop will iterate 5 times. Therefore, the loop bounds can be simplified to `for (int k = 0; k < 5; k++)`.\n2. Copy propagation was applied to the variable `l` in `fn3`. The value of `l` is never modified within the loop, so it can be replaced with its initial value of 0 in all occurrences.\n3. The variable `o` is unused in the program, so it was removed.\n\nThe resulting program is a simpler and more efficient version of the original program, with the same behavior.",
