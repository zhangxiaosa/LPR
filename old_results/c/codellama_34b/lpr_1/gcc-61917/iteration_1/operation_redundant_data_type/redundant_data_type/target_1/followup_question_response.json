The `const` keyword indicates that a variable is read-only and cannot be modified. This is more efficient than using `volatile`, which indicates that a variable may change its value at any time due to external factors.\n\nAdditionally, the program has been optimized by using a more efficient algorithm for the `fn2` function. The original algorithm used a loop to subtract the values of `p1_int` and `p2_int`. However, this loop is not necessary, as the subtract operation can be performed directly using the `-` operator.\n\nFinally, the program has been optimized by removing the unused variable `o` and the unused function `fn3`. These were not being used in the program and were therefore unnecessary.\n\nThe optimized program is as follows:\n```\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint fn2(int p1_int, int p2_int) { return p1_int - p2_int; }\n\nint main() { return 0; }\n```",
