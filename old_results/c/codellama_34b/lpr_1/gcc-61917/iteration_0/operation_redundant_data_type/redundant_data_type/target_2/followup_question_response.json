The `unsigned int` data type has been used in place of `e` in the function declarations and definitions.\n3. The `unsigned int` data type has been used in place of `e` in the `main` function.\n\nHere is the optimized program:\n```\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint fn2(unsigned int p1, unsigned int p2) { return p1 - p2; }\n\nunsigned int k;\nunsigned int l;\nvolatile unsigned int m[5][8];\n\nunsigned int fn3(unsigned int p1) {\n  unsigned int o = 0x4FL;\n  for (;;) {\n    for (l = 0; l < 20; l++)\n      for (k = 0; k >= -27; k = k - 6)\n        p1 = fn2(o, p1);\n    p1 || m[2][5];\n  }\n}\n\nint main() {\n  unsigned int p1 = 0;\n  fn3(p1);\n  return 0;\n}\n```\nNote that the optimization has not changed the behavior of the program, but it has made the code more readable and maintainable by using the original data type instead of a `typedef`.",
