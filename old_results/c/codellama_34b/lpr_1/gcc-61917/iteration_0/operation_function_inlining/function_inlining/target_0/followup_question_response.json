This means that the `fn1` function has been removed and its code has been inserted directly into the `fn3` function. This can improve performance by reducing the overhead of function calls.\n\nNote that the return type of `fn3` has been changed to `d` to match the return type of `fn1`. Also, the initialization of the `o` variable has been moved to the beginning of the `fn3` function, as it is no longer needed in the inlined version of `fn1`.",
