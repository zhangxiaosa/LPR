Constant propagation: The value of `e_int` is not used in the program, so we can replace it with its constant value `6L` in the `if` statement.\n2. Copy propagation: The value of `d_int` is assigned to `6L` in the `j` label, so we can replace the assignment with a copy of the value `6L`.\n\nThe optimized program has the same behavior as the original program, but it is simpler and more efficient.",

The `e_int` variable is only used in the `fn1` function, and it is not modified within the function, so it can be optimized out by copy propagation.\n\nAfter optimizing the program, the resulting program does not have any references to the `e_int` variable, and the `fn1` function still works correctly.",

Here is the optimized program:\n```\nint d_int;\nint fn1() {\n  d_int = 6L;\n  fn1();\n  return 0xEEACFBBFL;\n}\nint main() {}\n```\nIn this optimized program, the variable `e_int` is not used, so it has been optimized out. The `if` statement in the original program has also been removed, since the condition is always true. The `goto` statement has been replaced with a direct call to `fn1()`. The return value of `fn1()` is always `0xEEACFBBFL`, so it has been inlined. The variable `d_int` is initialized to `6L` and then passed as an argument to `fn1()`.\n\nThe optimization has been performed using a combination of constant propagation and copy propagation. Constant propagation has been used to propagate the constant value `6L` through the program, and copy propagation has been used to eliminate the redundant assignment to `d_int`.",

This optimization is valid because `e_int` is not used as a source of data for any other variable, and it is not involved in any control flow statements.\n\nNote that this optimization can be performed by any optimizing compiler, but it may not always be the most effective optimization.
