The `d = 6L` assignment has been moved to the `if` branch, and the `fn1();` call has been removed from the `else` branch.

The resulting code is smaller and more efficient, as there is no need to call and return from the `fn1` function. Instead, the code for `fn1` is executed directly in the `main` function.\n\nNote that the optimization of inlining `fn1` is only possible because `fn1` is a simple function with a single return statement. If `fn1` were more complex, it may not be possible to inline it without introducing additional overhead or changing the behavior of the program.",

We've also removed the recursive call to `fn1()` within the `if` statement, as it is no longer necessary since we've already returned the value `0xEEACFBBFL` from the function.\n\nNote that the optimized version of the program is not equivalent to the original program, as the original program had a recursive call to `fn1()` that was not necessary for the computation of the `d` variable. The optimized version of the program has removed this recursive call, which makes it more efficient and reduces the number of function calls.",
