The `d_int_val` variable is used to store the integer value that is being pointed to by `d_int_ptr`.\n\nThe rest of the program remains the same, with the exception of the `goto` statement, which has been replaced with a `goto` statement that uses the `d_int_ptr` variable to jump to the correct location in memory.\n\nBy decomposing the program in this way, we have eliminated the use of indirect addressing, which can improve the performance of the program by reducing the number of memory accesses required to access the variable `d_int`.",

By using a reference variable, we can avoid the overhead of copying the variable and pass the variable by reference instead.",

The `d_int_ptr` variable is a pointer to an integer, and the `d_int_val` variable is an integer. We have also modified the `fn1` function to use these two variables instead of the original `d_int` variable.\n\nThe `fn1` function now takes a pointer to an integer as an argument, and it uses the `d_int_ptr` variable to store the address of the integer that is passed to it. The `d_int_val` variable is used to store the value of the integer that is pointed to by `d_int_ptr`.\n\nIn the `main` function, we have created a pointer to an integer, `d_int_ptr`, and we have initialized it to point to the `d_int` variable. We have also created an integer variable, `d_int_val`, and we have initialized it to the value of the integer that is pointed to by `d_int_ptr`.\n\nWe have then called the `fn1` function with the `d_int_ptr` pointer as an argument, and we have stored the result of the function in the `result` variable. Finally, we have printed the result to the console.\n\nThis program should behave the same as the original program, but it should be more efficient because it avoids the overhead of dereferencing the `d_int` pointer in the `fn1` function.",

For example, the line `if (d_int)` has been replaced with `if (d_int_value)` to check the value of the integer stored in `d_int_value`. Similarly, the line `d_int = 6L` has been replaced with `d_int_ptr = 6L` to assign the address of the variable that `d_int` points to.\n\nWith this decomposition, the optimization can be applied to the program without affecting the behavior of the original program.",

The function `fn1()` has also been modified to use the `d_int` variable directly and to return an `int` value.\n\nThe optimization goal of the program is to eliminate the `goto` statement and to use a more straightforward control flow. The `if` statement has been used to check the value of `d_int` and to execute the appropriate branch of the program. The `goto` statement has been removed and the program now uses a more straightforward control flow.\n\nThe target to be optimized is the `d_int` variable, which is now a primary data type.
