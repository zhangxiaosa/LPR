This is done by using a preprocessor directive (`#define`) to redefine the `int` keyword to be equivalent to `long`. This change affects all instances of `int` in the program, including the function return types, function parameters, and variable declarations.",

It is used to store a numerical value and is later used in a comparison operation.\n\nTo optimize this program, we can substitute the `int` data type with its associated original data type, which is `long int`. This will result in the following program:\n```\nlong int d_int;\nint fn1() {\n  if (d_int)\n    goto j;\n  fn1();\n  return 0xEEACFBBFL;\nj:\n  d_int = 6L;\n  fn1();\n  return 0xEEACFBBFL;\n}\nint main() {}\n```\nIn this optimized program, the variable `d_int` is now of type `long int`, which is the original data type associated with the `int` data type. This optimization will result in a more efficient program that uses less memory and is faster to execute.",

This is because the `long` data type is not used in the program and can be safely removed. Additionally, we have also replaced the `goto` statement with a `return` statement, as it is generally considered better practice to use `return` statements instead of `goto` statements.\n\nThe program still exhibits the same behavior as the original program, but it has been optimized to use only the `int` data type, which is the target data type for this optimization.",
