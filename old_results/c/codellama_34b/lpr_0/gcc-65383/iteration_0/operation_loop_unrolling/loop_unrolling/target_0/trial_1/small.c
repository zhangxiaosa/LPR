Explanation:

The loop in the program is infinite, and the only statement inside the loop is the assignment of the variable `g`. The assignment is not dependent on any other variables, so it can be moved outside the loop and executed only once.

By moving the assignment outside the loop, the loop becomes redundant and can be removed. This results in a simpler and more efficient program.

The optimized code is functionally equivalent to the original program, but with the unnecessary loop removed.
