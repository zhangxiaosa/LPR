The program also defines a global variable \"g\" of type \"d\" and a function \"fn2\" that takes no arguments and returns a value of type \"d\". The function has a loop that initializes a variable \"q\" to the value 0xC3L and a two-dimensional array \"r\" with dimensions 5x9x5. The loop then checks the value of the global variable \"h\" and returns the value of \"q\" if it is non-zero. Finally, the function assigns the value of the expression \"r[i][i][i]\" to the global variable \"g\", where \"i\" is the loop variable.\n\nThe program does not have any redundant data types.",
