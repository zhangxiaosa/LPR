Constant folding: The constant `0x06D7L` is folded into the initialization of the static variable `i` to reduce the number of instructions.\n3. Dead code elimination: The dead code in the `if` statement in `fn1` is eliminated, as it is never executed.\n4. Copy elimination: The copy of the variable `j` in `fn2` is eliminated, as it is not used.\n5. Type analysis: The type of the variable `j` is changed to `int` to match the type of the return value of `fn2`.\n6. Redundant parentheses: The redundant parentheses in the function call to `fn1` are removed.",
