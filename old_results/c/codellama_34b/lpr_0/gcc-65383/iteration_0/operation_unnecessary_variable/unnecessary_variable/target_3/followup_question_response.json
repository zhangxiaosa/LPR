Constant propagation:\nThe constant 0xC3L is assigned to the variable q in the initialization of the for loop. Since this constant is not modified in the loop, it can be propagated to all the uses of q, including the return statement. Therefore, the assignment to q can be eliminated, and the return statement can be simplified to return 0xC3L.\n2. Copy propagation:\nThe variable g is assigned the value of r[0x06D7L] in the loop. Since r is a local array and its value is not modified in the loop, the value of g can be propagated to all the uses of g, including the return statement. Therefore, the assignment to g can be eliminated, and the return statement can be simplified to return 0xC3L.\n\nThe optimized program is:\n```\ntypedef unsigned d;\nd g;\nunsigned h2 = 0x92A1D2CDL;\nstatic unsigned i = 0x06D7L;\nunsigned fn2() {\n  for (;;) {\n    unsigned r[5];\n    if (h2)\n      return 0xC3L;\n  }\n}\nint main() { fn2(); }\n```\nNote that the variable g is no longer used in the optimized program, so it can be eliminated as well.
