The optimization can be done by changing the data type of `h` to a more efficient data type, such as `unsigned long` or `unsigned int`, or by using a more efficient algorithm to access the elements of `h`.",

Also, the new values of `g_0` and `g_1` are calculated using the XOR operation, which is more efficient than the original code. The optimized code is then used to replace the original code in the `main` function.",
