Constant propagation: The value of `h2_0` is known at compile-time, so we can replace all occurrences of `h2_0` with its value, which is `0x92A1`.\n2. Copy propagation: The variable `r` is not used anywhere in the program, so we can eliminate its declaration and all references to it.\n\nThe resulting program is smaller and more efficient, as it no longer contains unnecessary code.",

This optimization has been performed using the constant propagation technique.\n\nNote that the program's output remains the same after optimization, as the value of `r` was not used anywhere in the program.",

Since `h2_0` is a constant, we can propagate this constant value to the assignment of `g`.\n3. Since the `fn2` function is infinite, we can simplify the loop and eliminate the `if` statement.\n4. The `main` function is empty, so it can be removed.\n\nThe optimized program is smaller and more efficient, as it eliminates unnecessary variables and loops, and propagates constant values.",
