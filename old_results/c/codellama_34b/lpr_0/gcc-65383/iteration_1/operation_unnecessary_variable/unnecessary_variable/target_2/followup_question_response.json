We have also replaced the reference to `h2_1` in the `if` statement with a constant value of `0`, as the variable is not used in the program.\n\nBy eliminating the unused variable `h2_1`, we have simplified the program and optimized it by constant propagation and copy propagation.",

The constant propagation optimization can be applied to the `if` statement, as the condition `h2_0` is always true, and the `return` statement can be optimized out.\n\nIn the optimized code, the `if` statement and the `return` statement are removed, and the `g = r[0x06D7];` statement is also optimized out, as it is unused. The optimized code will produce the same output as the original code, but it will run faster and use less memory.",
