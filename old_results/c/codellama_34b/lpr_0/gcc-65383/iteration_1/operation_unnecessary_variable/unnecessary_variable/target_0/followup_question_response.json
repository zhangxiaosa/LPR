This will eliminate the use of the variable `g` and simplify the code.\n\nThe optimized code using constant propagation is:\n```\n#include <stdint.h>\nuint16_t h2_0 = 0x92A1;\nuint16_t h2_1;\nuint32_t fn2() {\n  for (;;) {\n    uint32_t r[5];\n    if (h2_0)\n      return h2_1;\n    r[0x06D7] = r[0x06D7];\n  }\n}\nint main() { fn2(); }\n```\nUsing copy propagation, we can eliminate the variable `g` by replacing its uses with the value it is assigned.
