The variable `h2` is assigned a constant value of `0x92A1D2CD`, which is not changed throughout the program. Therefore, it can be replaced with its constant value in the comparison statement. The variable `r` is also not used in the program, so it can be eliminated. The `for` loop is infinite, so the function `fn2` will never return a value. Therefore, the `main` function can be simplified to just calling `fn2`.",
