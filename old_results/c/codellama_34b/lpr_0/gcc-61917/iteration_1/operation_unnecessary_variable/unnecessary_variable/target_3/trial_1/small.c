Given the program and the specified variable, optimize it out by constant propagation or copy propagation. If this variable is unused, just optimize it out.

The program is:
int k;
int l;
volatile int m[5][8];
int fn3(p1) {
  int o;
  for (;;) {
    for (; l; l++)
      for (k = 0; k >= -27; k = k - 6)
        p1 = o - p1;
    p1 || m[2][5];
  }
}
int main() {}

The target to be optimized is `o`.

After optimizing the program using constant propagation and copy propagation, the resulting program is:
