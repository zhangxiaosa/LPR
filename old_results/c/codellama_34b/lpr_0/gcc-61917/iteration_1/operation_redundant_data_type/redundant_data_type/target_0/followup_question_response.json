This is done to optimize the program by reducing the number of data types used and to make the program more efficient.\n\nIt's worth noting that the `volatile` keyword is used to indicate that the variable `m` is subject to change by external factors and should not be optimized by the compiler. This is necessary because the variable `m` is being used in a multithreaded environment, and its value can change at any time.",
