The program you provided is not valid C code. It appears to be a fragment of a program, and there are several syntax errors and other issues that need to be addressed before it can be optimized.

Assuming that the program you provided is complete and correct, and that the target to be optimized is the variable `i`, I will explain how I would approach the optimization using constant propagation and copy propagation.

First, I would analyze the program to identify all the variables that are involved in the optimization process. In this case, the variables are `i`, `j`, `k`, `l`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `p4`, `p5`, `q`, and `r`.

Next, I would identify the instructions in the program that access or modify the variables. In this case, the instructions are `p5.j`, `goto w`, `fn1(q, l, p1, 3, p)`, `p = r = p`, and `main()`.

Then, I would apply constant propagation and copy propagation to the program. Constant propagation involves replacing constant expressions with their corresponding values. In this case, the constant expression `p5.j` can be replaced with its value `p5.j`. Copy propagation involves replacing variables with their corresponding values. In this case, the variable `i` can be replaced with its value `p5.j`.

After applying constant propagation and copy propagation, the optimized program would be:
