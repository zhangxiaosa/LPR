Optimized program:

struct h {
  int i;
  long j;
  int k;
};

static struct h fn1(struct h p5) {
  p5.j;
w:;
  goto w;
}

unsigned fn2() {
  struct h p;
  fn1(p);
  for (;;) {
    struct h r;
    p = r = p;
  }
}

int main() {}

</SYS>

Explanation:

In the original program, the variable `p5` is unused in the `fn1` function. Therefore, we can optimize it out by constant propagation or copy propagation. Since the variable `p5` is not modified in the `fn1` function, we can propagate the value of `p5` to the call site in `fn2` and replace the variable `p5` with the constant value `0`.

The optimized program is as follows:
