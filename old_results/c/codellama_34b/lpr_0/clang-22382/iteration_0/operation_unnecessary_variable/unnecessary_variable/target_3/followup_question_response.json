However, we can still optimize the variable `l` by constant propagation.\n\nIn the `fn1` function, the variable `l` is passed as an argument, but it is not used in the function body. Therefore, we can propagate the value of `l` from the call site in `fn2` to the function body of `fn1`, and replace all occurrences of `l` with the value of `p3`.\n\nAfter optimizing the program, it should look like this:\n```\nstruct h {\n  int i;\n  long j;\n  int k;\n};\nstatic struct h fn1(unsigned p1, short p2, unsigned p3, unsigned p4,\n                    struct h p5) {\n  p5.j;\nw:;\n  goto w;\n}\nunsigned fn2(p1) {\n  struct h p;\n  unsigned q;\n  fn1(q, p1, 3, p);\n  for (;;) {\n    struct h r;\n    p = r = p;\n  }\n}\nint main() {}\n```\nNote that the variable `l` has been removed from the program, and its value has been propagated to the function body of `fn1`.",

The function `fn2` is called with the value `1` for the parameter `p1`, which is the same value that was previously assigned to `q`.\n\nThe for loop in the function `fn2` has been optimized out, as it is not necessary to have a loop with an infinite number of iterations. The variable `r` is not used, so it has been removed. The variable `p` is assigned the value `p`, which is not necessary, as it already has the same value.\n\nThe function `main` is empty, so it has been removed.\n\nThe resulting program is smaller and more efficient, as it does not contain any unnecessary variables or code.",
