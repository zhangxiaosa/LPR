Therefore, we can optimize it out by constant propagation or copy propagation.\n\nOne way to optimize it out is to replace all occurrences of `p3` with the constant `1`, which is the value that is passed as the first argument to `fn1` when it is called from `fn2`. This can be done using the following steps:\n\n1. In the definition of `fn1`, replace the parameter `p3` with the constant `1`.\n2. In the call to `fn1` from `fn2`, replace the argument `p3` with the constant `1`.\n\nHere is the optimized version of the program:\n```\nstruct h {\n  int i;\n  long j;\n  int k;\n};\n\nstatic struct h fn1(short p3, unsigned p4, struct h p5) {\n  p5.j;\n  goto w;\n}\n\nunsigned fn2() {\n  struct h p;\n  fn1(1, 3, p);\n  for (;;) {\n    struct h r;\n    p = r = p;\n  }\n}\n\nint main() {}\n```\n\nAlternatively, we can use copy propagation to optimize out the variable `p3`. In this case, we can replace all occurrences of `p3` with the variable `p`, which is the variable that is passed as the first argument to `fn1`. This can be done using the following steps:\n\n1. In the definition of `fn1`, replace the parameter `p3` with the variable `p`.\n2. In the call to `fn1` from `fn2`, replace the argument `p3` with the variable `p`.\n\nHere is the optimized version of the program:\n```\nstruct h {\n  int i;\n  long j;\n  int k;\n};\n\nstatic struct h fn1(short p, unsigned p4, struct h p5) {\n  p5.j;\n  goto w;\n}\n\nunsigned fn2() {\n  struct h p;\n  fn1(p, 3, p);\n  for (;;) {\n    struct h r;\n    p = r = p;\n  }\n}\n\nint main() {}\n```\nIn both cases, the variable `p3` is not used in the optimized program, and it can be safely removed.",
