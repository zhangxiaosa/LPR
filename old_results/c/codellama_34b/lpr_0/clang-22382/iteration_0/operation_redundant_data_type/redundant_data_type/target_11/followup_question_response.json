The `struct h` data type has been eliminated from the program altogether, and the `fn1` and `fn2` functions have been modified accordingly.\n\nThe optimized program is shown below:\n```\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nunsigned l;\nstatic unsigned fn1(unsigned p1, short p2, unsigned p3, unsigned p4,\n                    unsigned p5) {\n  p5;\nw:;\n  goto w;\n}\n\nunsigned fn2(unsigned p1) {\n  unsigned q;\n  fn1(q, l, p1, 3, q);\n  for (;;) {\n    unsigned r;\n    q = r = q;\n  }\n}\n\nint main() {}\n```\nNote that the `struct h` data type has been eliminated from the program, and the `fn1` and `fn2` functions have been modified accordingly.

It takes an `unsigned` parameter `p1` and returns an `unsigned` value. The function `fn1` is called with the arguments `q`, `l`, `p1`, `3`, and `p`, where `q` is an `unsigned` variable, `l` is a global variable, and `p` is a struct of type `h`. The function `fn1` returns a struct of type `h`.\n\nThe optimization of `fn2` involves eliminating the unnecessary use of the struct `h` and replacing it with its associated original data type, which is `unsigned`. To do this, we can replace the declaration of the struct `h` with the declaration of an `unsigned` variable `p5`, and replace the call to `fn1` with a call to a new function `fn3` that takes `unsigned` parameters and returns an `unsigned` value.\n\nHere is the optimized program:\n```\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nunsigned l;\n\nunsigned fn3(unsigned p1, unsigned p2, unsigned p3, unsigned p4,\n             unsigned p5) {\n  p5;\nw:;\n  goto w;\n}\n\nunsigned fn2(unsigned p1) {\n  unsigned p;\n  unsigned q;\n  fn3(q, l, p1, 3, p);\n  for (;;) {\n    unsigned r;\n    p = r = p;\n  }\n}\n\nint main() {}\n```\n\nIn this optimized program, the function `fn2` no longer uses the struct `h` and instead uses `unsigned` variables for all of its parameters and return values. The function `fn3` is a new function that takes `unsigned` parameters and returns an `unsigned` value, and it is used to replace the call to `fn1` in `fn2`. The function `fn3` is similar to `fn1`, but it does not use the struct `h` and instead uses `unsigned` variables for all of its parameters and return values.",
