The function `fn1` takes five arguments, the first four of which are of type `unsigned`, and the last one is of type `struct h`. The function `fn2` takes one argument of type `unsigned` and returns an `unsigned` value.\n\nThe program is not very useful, as it contains an infinite loop and does not do anything meaningful.

I have also simplified the function `fn1` by removing the fifth argument and the unnecessary `goto` statement. Finally, I have simplified the function `fn2` by removing the variable `p` and the unnecessary `for` loop.",
