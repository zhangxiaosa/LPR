We have also updated the references to `p5` in the `fn1` function to use the individual variables instead. Finally, we have updated the references to `p` in the `fn2` function to use the individual variables instead.\n\nThis approach allows us to optimize the program by reducing the number of times the `p5` variable is accessed and modified, which can improve the performance of the program.",

We have also modified the `fn1` function to take a variable of type `struct h` as an argument, and we have modified the `fn2` function to return a variable of type `struct h`.\n\nThe optimized program now has a more efficient memory layout, with each primary data type component stored in its own variable, rather than being stored as a complex data type.
