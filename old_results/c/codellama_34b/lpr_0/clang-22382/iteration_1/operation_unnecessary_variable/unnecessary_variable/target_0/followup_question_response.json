The function `fn2` has also been modified to call `fn1` with the `struct h` parameter instead of the `struct h*` parameter.\n\nThe optimization has been done by propagating the constant value of `i` to the function `fn1`, and then removing the unused variable `i` from the struct `h`. The program has also been modified to use the optimized `fn1` function.\n\nNote that this optimization may change the behavior of the program, as the value of `i` is no longer being computed and stored in the struct.
