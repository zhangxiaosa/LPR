The type of `n` is `signed` and the type of `o` is `signed`.\n\nTo decompose the structure into variables with primary data types, we can create two variables: `n` and `o`. The type of `n` will be `signed int` and the type of `o` will be `signed int`.\n\nHere is the decomposed program:\n```\nint n;\nint o;\n\nvoid g(unsigned p1, int p2) {\n    return p2;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    n = 1957;\n    o = g(v, 5);\n    int ae = o;\n    o = u;\n    r = t % (~s / ae);\n    o;\n}\n```\nIn this decomposed program, we have replaced the structure `struct m` with two variables `n` and `o`.

The field `n` is a signed integer with a size of 18 bits, and the field `o` is a signed integer with a size of 1 bit.\n\nNext, we can look at the variables declared in the program:\n```\nint r;\nstatic int s = -5L;\nunsigned t;\nint u;\nunsigned v;\n```\nThere are five variables declared in this program: `r`, `s`, `t`, `u`, and `v`. `r` is an integer, `s` is a static integer with an initial value of -5L, `t` is an unsigned integer, `u` is an integer, and `v` is an unsigned integer.\n\nNow, we can decompose the program into variables with primary data types. We can start by looking at the `main` function:\n```\nint main() {\n  struct m ad = {1957};\n  ad.o = g(v, 5);\n  int ae = ad.o;\n  ad.o = u;\n  r = t % (~s / ae);\n  ad.o;\n}\n```\nIn this function, we can see that the variable `ad` is a structure of type `m`. We can decompose this variable into its individual fields:\n```\nstruct m ad = {1957};\nint ad_n = ad.n;\nint ad_o = ad.o;\n```\nWe can also see that the variable `ae` is an integer that is assigned the value of `ad.o`. We can decompose this variable as follows:\n```\nint ae = ad.o;\n```\nNext, we can look at the variable `r`. This variable is declared as an integer, so we can decompose it as follows:\n```\nint r;\n```\nFinally, we can look at the variable `s`. This variable is declared as a static integer with an initial value of -5L. We can decompose this variable as follows:\n```\nstatic int s = -5L;\n```\nPutting everything together, we get the following decomposition of the program into variables with primary data types:\n```\nstruct m {\n  signed n : 18;\n  signed o : 1;\n};\nint r;\nstatic int s = -5L;\nunsigned t;\nint u;\nunsigned v;\n\nint main() {\n  struct m ad = {1957};\n  int ad_n = ad.n;\n  int ad_o = ad.o;\n  int ae = ad.o;\n  ad.o = u;\n  r = t % (~s / ae);\n  ad.o;\n}\n```\nThis decomposition shows the primary data types of each variable in the program, and how they are used in the program's execution.",
