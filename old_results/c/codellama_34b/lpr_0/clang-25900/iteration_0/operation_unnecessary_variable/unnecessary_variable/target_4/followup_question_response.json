Constant Propagation:\nThe variable 's' is initialized with the value -5L, which is a constant. This value can be propagated throughout the program and used in place of the variable 's' wherever it is used. This will eliminate the need to store the value of 's' in memory and reduce the number of instructions required to perform the computation.\n```\nint main() {\n  struct m ad = {1957};\n  ad.o = g(v, 5);\n  int ae = ad.o;\n  ad.o = u;\n  r = t % (~(-5L) / ae);\n  ad.o;\n}\n```\n2. Copy Propagation:\nThe variable 'ae' is only assigned the value of 'ad.o' and is never modified. Therefore, the value of 'ad.o' can be propagated throughout the program and used in place of 'ae' wherever it is used. This will eliminate the need to store the value of 'ae' in memory and reduce the number of instructions required to perform the computation.\n```\nint main() {\n  struct m ad = {1957};\n  ad.o = g(v, 5);\n  r = t % (~(-5L) / ad.o);\n  ad.o;\n}\n```\n3.

Eliminating the unnecessary assignment:\nThe last assignment to 'ad.o' is not used, so it can be eliminated.\n```\nint main() {\n  struct m ad = {1957};\n  ad.o = g(v, 5);\n  r = t % (~(-5L) / ad.o);\n}\n```\nThe optimized program is:\n```\nint main() {\n  struct m ad = {1957};\n  ad.o = g(v, 5);\n  r = t % (~(-5L) / ad.o);\n}\n```\nNote that the optimized program is functionally equivalent to the original program, but it has fewer instructions and is more efficient.",

The expression `g(v, 5)` can be evaluated to `5`.\n\t* The variable `ae` is assigned the value `5` in the initialization of `ad.o`.\n2.
