This expression is equal to `1`, so the optimized expression would be `t % 1`, which is equivalent to `t`.\n\nNext, we can optimize the assignment to `ae` by propagating the value of `ad.o` to the left-hand side of the assignment. This would eliminate the need for the variable `ae` altogether.\n\nFinally, we can optimize the assignment to `ad.o` by propagating the value of `u` to the left-hand side of the assignment. This would eliminate the need for the variable `ad.o` altogether.\n\nThe optimized program would look like this:\n```\nunsigned g(unsigned p1, int p2) { return p2; }\nstruct m {\n  signed n : 18;\n  signed o : 1;\n};\nint r;\nstatic int s = -5L;\nunsigned t;\nint u;\nunsigned v;\nint main() {\n  struct m ad = {1957};\n  ad.o = g(v, 5);\n  t = u;\n  r = t % 1;\n  ad.o;\n}\n```\nNote that the optimized program still has the same semantics as the original program, but it has been simplified by eliminating unnecessary variables and expressions.",

Constant Propagation:\nThe variable `ae` is assigned the value of `ad.o`, which is a struct member that is assigned the value of `g(v, 5)`. Since the function `g` returns a constant value, we can replace `g(v, 5)` with its return value, which is `5`. So, we can replace `ae` with `5` in the program.\n\n2. Copy Propagation:\nThe variable `ad.o` is assigned the value of `u` in the line `ad.o = u;`. Since `u` is not used anywhere else in the program, we can replace all instances of `ad.o` with `u`.\n\nAfter applying both constant propagation and copy propagation, the optimized program is:\n```\nstruct m {\n  signed n : 18;\n  signed o : 1;\n};\nint r;\nstatic int s = -5L;\nunsigned t;\nint u;\nunsigned v;\nint main() {\n  struct m ad = {1957};\n  int ae = 5;\n  ad.o = u;\n  r = t % (~s / ae);\n  ad.o;\n}\n```\nNote that the variable `ae` is no longer used in the optimized program, so it can be removed.",
