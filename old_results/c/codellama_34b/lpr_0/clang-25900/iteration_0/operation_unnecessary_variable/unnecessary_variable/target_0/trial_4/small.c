In this optimized program, we have performed the following optimizations:

1. Constant propagation: We have replaced the call to the function `g` with the constant value `5` because the value of `v` is not used in the program.
2. Copy propagation: We have replaced the variable `ae` with the value `5` because it is not used in the program after it is initialized.
3. Dead code elimination: We have removed the assignment to the variable `ad.o` because it is not used in the program after it is initialized.
