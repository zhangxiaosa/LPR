The given program has several instances of the data type `c`, which is a typedef for `int`. To eliminate this data type and substitute it with its associated original data type, we can use the following steps:

1. Replace all instances of `c` with `int`.
2. Remove the typedef for `c`.

Here's the modified program with the optimized data types:
