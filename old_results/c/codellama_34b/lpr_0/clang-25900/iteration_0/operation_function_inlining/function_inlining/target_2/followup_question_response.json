Identify the function to be inlined: In this case, the function to be inlined is `fn3`.\n2. Determine the target platform: The target platform for this optimization is x86-64.\n3. Inline the function: We can inline `fn3` by replacing its call site with the body of the function. The body of `fn3` is as follows:\n```\nstruct m ad = {1957};\nad.o = fn1(v, 5);\na ae;\nc af = t;\nae = ad.o;\nad.o = u;\nr = af % (~s / ae);\nad.o;\n```\nWe can replace the call site of `fn3` with this body, resulting in the following optimized code:\n```\nstruct m ad = {1957};\nad.o = fn1(v, 5);\na ae;\nc af = t;\nae = ad.o;\nad.o = u;\nr = af % (~s / ae);\nad.o;\n```\n4. Remove the function definition: Once the function has been inlined, we can remove its definition from the program.\n\nThe optimized program is as follows:\n```\ntypedef signed a;\ntypedef short b;\ntypedef int c;\ntypedef long d;\ntypedef unsigned e;\ntypedef unsigned f;\ntypedef unsigned g;\ne fn1(e p1, int p2) { return p2; }\nstruct k {\n  f l;\n};\nstruct m {\n  signed n : 18;\n  signed o : 1;\n};\na p;\nstruct k q;\nc r;\nstatic a s = -5L;\ng t;\nc u;\ng v;\nb fn3(g p1) {\n  struct m ad = {1957};\n  ad.o = fn1(v, 5);\n  a ae;\n  c af = t;\n  ae = ad.o;\n  ad.o = u;\n  r = af % (~s / ae);\n  ad.o;\n}\nint main() {\n  struct m z;\n  fn3(q.l);\n}\n```\nNote that the optimized program still contains the `fn1` function, which is used in the inlined code for `fn3`.",
