The function body is simply `return p2;`, so the function call `g(v, 5)` has been replaced with `5`. This has eliminated the need for the `g` function and has simplified the program.\n\nNote that the `g` function was not used anywhere else in the program, so it was safe to inline it without affecting the behavior of the program.
