Additionally, the `s` variable has been changed from `int32_t` to `int16_t`, as it is only used for a comparison with the `ad.o` field. The `t` variable has also been changed from `int32_t` to `int16_t`, as it is only used for a modulus operation with the `r` variable. The `v` variable has been changed from `int32_t` to `int16_t`, as it is only used for a comparison with the `p1` variable.\n\nThe performance of the optimized program can be measured by comparing its execution time to the original program.
