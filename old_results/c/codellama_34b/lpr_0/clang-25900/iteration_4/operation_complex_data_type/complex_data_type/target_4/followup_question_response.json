The list of variables with complex data types in the program is:\n\n* `struct m`: This is a structure type, which is a complex data type in C.\n* `ad`: This is a structure variable of type `struct m`.\n\nTo optimize the program, we can decompose the `struct m` into the following variables with primary data types:\n\n* `n`: This is an `int` variable that represents the `n` field of the `struct m` structure.\n* `o`: This is an `int` variable that represents the `o` field of the `struct m` structure.\n\nThe optimized program with the decomposed variables is:\n```\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint g(int p1, int p2) { return p2; }\n\nint main() {\n  int n = 1957;\n  int o = g(5, 5);\n  int ae = o;\n  o = 5;\n  int r = t % (17 / ae);\n  o;\n}\n```\nIn this optimized program, the `struct m` and `ad` variables have been removed, and the `n` and `o` variables have been added to represent the fields of the `struct m` structure.

Additionally, the `ad.o` statement at the end of the program is not needed, as the value of `ad.o` is not used anywhere in the program.\n\nAssuming that the program is supposed to return the value of `ad.o` as the result of the function, here is a corrected version of the program that decomposes the complex data type `struct m` into its primary data type components:\n```\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint g(int p1, int p2) { return p2; }\n\nstruct m {\n  int n : 18;\n  int o : 1;\n};\n\nint main() {\n  struct m ad = {1957};\n  int ae = ad.o;\n  ad.o = 5;\n  r = t % (17 / ae);\n  return ad.o;\n}\n```\nIn this version of the program, the `struct m` type is decomposed into its `n` and `o` components, which are both `int` types. The `g` function is not used in this version of the program, as it is not needed to solve the problem.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if you need further assistance.",
