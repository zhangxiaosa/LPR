The expression `t % (17 / ae)` is equivalent to `t % (17 / ad.o)`, where `ad.o` is the value of the `o` field of the `ad` struct.\n\nTo decompose this program into variables with primary data types, we can introduce the following variables:\n```\nint p1 = 5;\nint p2 = 5;\nint ae = g(p1, p2);\nint ad_n = 1957;\nint ad_o = ae;\nint t = 17;\n```\nThen, we can rewrite the program as:\n```\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint g(int p1, int p2) { return p2; }\n\nint main() {\n  int p1 = 5;\n  int p2 = 5;\n  int ae = g(p1, p2);\n  int ad_n = 1957;\n  int ad_o = ae;\n  int t = 17;\n\n  r = t % (t / ad_o);\n\n  return 0;\n}\n```\nThis program is functionally equivalent to the original program, but with the variables `p1`, `p2`, `ae`, `ad_n`, `ad_o`, and `t` added to the program. The variable `r` is still the target to be optimized, and it is being assigned the result of the expression `t % (t / ad_o)`.",
