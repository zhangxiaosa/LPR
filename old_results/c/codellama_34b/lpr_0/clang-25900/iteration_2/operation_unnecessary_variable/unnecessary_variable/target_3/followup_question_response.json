Constant propagation: The function `g` is called with the argument `p2` which is a constant value. The function `g` simply returns the value of `p2`. Since `p2` is a constant, we can eliminate the function call and replace it with the constant value of `p2`.\n2. Copy propagation: The variable `ae` is assigned the value of `ad.o`, which is a copy of the value of `ad.n`. Since `ad.n` is a constant, we can eliminate the variable `ae` and use the constant value of `ad.n` directly.\n3. Dead code elimination: The variable `v` is not used in the program, so we can eliminate the declaration of `v`.\n4. Constant folding: The expression `17 / ae` is a constant expression, and `ae` is a constant value. We can evaluate the expression `17 / ae` at compile-time and replace it with the constant value of `17 / 5`.\n\nThe optimized program has fewer instructions and is more efficient.",
