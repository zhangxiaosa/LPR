This type has two members, `n` and `o`, both of which are of type `int32_t`. So, we can decompose the `struct m` type into two primary data types:\n```\nstruct m {\n  int32_t n;\n  int32_t o;\n};\n```\nNext, we can decompose the `g` function. This function takes two parameters, `p1` and `p2`, both of which are of type `int32_t`, and returns a value of type `int32_t`. So, we can decompose the function into two primary data types:\n```\nint32_t g(int32_t p1, int32_t p2) { return p2; }\n```\nFinally, we can decompose the `main` function. This function has several variables of type `int32_t`, including `r`, `t`, `v`, and `ae`. We can decompose these variables into primary data types as follows:\n```\nint32_t r;\nint32_t t;\nint32_t v;\nint32_t ae;\n\nint main() {\n  struct m ad = {1957};\n  ad.o = g(v, 5);\n  ae = ad.o;\n  ad.o = 5;\n  r = t % (17 / ae);\n  ad.o;\n}\n```\nSo, the final decomposition of the program into primary data types is:\n```\n#include <stdint.h>\n\nint32_t g(int32_t p1, int32_t p2) { return p2; }\n\nstruct m {\n  int32_t n;\n  int32_t o;\n};\n\nint32_t r;\nint32_t t;\nint32_t v;\nint32_t ae;\n\nint main() {\n  struct m ad = {1957};\n  ad.o = g(v, 5);\n  ae = ad.o;\n  ad.o = 5;\n  r = t % (17 / ae);\n  ad.o;\n}\n```\nNote that this decomposition is not unique, and there are many other ways to decompose the program into primary data types. The important thing is to identify the primary data types used in the program and to ensure that the decomposition is consistent and meaningful.",
