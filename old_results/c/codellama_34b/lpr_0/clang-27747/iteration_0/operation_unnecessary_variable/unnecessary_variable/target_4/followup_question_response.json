Therefore, we can optimize out `n` and replace it with the constant expression `1`.\n4. The variable `o` is assigned the value of `l.d`, which is a constant expression that can be evaluated at compile-time. Therefore, we can optimize out `o` and replace it with the constant expression `24`.\n5. The variable `i.d` is assigned the value of `o | -(l.f && l.d) - n`, which is a constant expression that can be evaluated at compile-time.
