Constant propagation:\nSince the value of `j` is not changed within the program, we can propagate the value of `j` into the expressions that use it. This will simplify the expressions and reduce the number of operations. For example, instead of `j && l.d`, we can use `j && 24`.\n2. Copy propagation:\nThe variable `l` is only assigned once, and its value is never changed. Therefore, we can propagate the value of `l` into the expressions that use it. This will eliminate the need to access the `l` variable and reduce the number of operations. For example, instead of `l.d`, we can use `24`.\n\nHere is the optimized program:\n```\nstruct c {\n  int d : 18;\n  int f;\n};\nstruct c i;\nint j;\nint main() {\n  struct c l = {24, 6738};\n  l.d = j;\n  int n = j && 24;\n  i.d = 24 | -(6738 && 24) - n;\n}\n```\nThe optimized program has the same behavior as the original program, but it has fewer operations and is more efficient.",
