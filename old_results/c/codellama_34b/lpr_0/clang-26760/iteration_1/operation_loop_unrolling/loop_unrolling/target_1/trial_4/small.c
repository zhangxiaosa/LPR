The target to be optimized is the outer loop: `for (f = 0; f;)`

To optimize this loop, we can use loop unrolling. The idea behind loop unrolling is to replace the loop with a set of instructions that perform the same operation as the loop, but with fewer branches and less overhead.

In this case, we can unroll the loop by a factor of 4, which means that we will replace the loop with 4 copies of the loop body, each of which will be executed sequentially. Here is the optimized program:
