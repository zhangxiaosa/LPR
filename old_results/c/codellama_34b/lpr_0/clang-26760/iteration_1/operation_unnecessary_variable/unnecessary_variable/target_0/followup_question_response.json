Constant propagation: The value of `j` is constant and can be propagated through the program. The loop condition `j` is always false, so the loop is not executed.\n2. Copy propagation: The value of `k` is copied from `j` and the loop condition `j` is not used. Therefore, the copy of `k` can be optimized out.\n3. Unused variable: The variable `i` is not used in the program, so it can be optimized out.\n\nThe optimized program is smaller and more efficient than the original program.",
