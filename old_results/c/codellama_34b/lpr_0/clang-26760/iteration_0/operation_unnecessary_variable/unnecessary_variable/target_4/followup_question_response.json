Constant Propagation:\nThe variable `j` is assigned the value 0x24F96B7BL, which is a constant. This value can be propagated throughout the program, replacing all instances of `j` with the constant value.\n\nOptimized Program:\n```\nunsigned f;\nint g;\nint main() {\n  int i;\n  unsigned k;\n  for (f = 0; f;)\n    for (; 0x24F96B7BL; --0x24F96B7BL)\n      ;\n  unsigned l = 1L;\n  int n = g;\n  while (n) {\n    k = k >> 1L;\n    i = n;\n    if (i)\n      k = k << 0x24F96B7BL;\n  }\n}\n```\n2. Copy Propagation:\nThe variable `n` is assigned the value of `g`, which is a global variable.
