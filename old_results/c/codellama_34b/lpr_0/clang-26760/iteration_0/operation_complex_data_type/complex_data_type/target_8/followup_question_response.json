The variable `p` has been replaced with `g`, which is a more descriptive name for the variable. The data type of `g` has been changed from `int` to `unsigned int`, as it is not necessary to use a signed integer for this variable.\n\nThe optimization has been achieved by reducing the number of variables and using more efficient data types.
