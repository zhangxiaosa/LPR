Instead, it is simply defined as a long integer. This eliminates the unnecessary use of the `__attribute__((__vector_size__(sizeof(long))))` attribute, which was used to specify that `d` should be treated as a vector.\n\nThe optimized program is smaller and more efficient, as it no longer includes the unnecessary definition of the `d` data type as a vector.",
