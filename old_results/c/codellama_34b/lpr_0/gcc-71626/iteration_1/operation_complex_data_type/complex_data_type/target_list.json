["`d`", "`d`: This is a typedef for a vector of `long` values.", "`fn1`", "`fn1`: This is a function that takes no arguments and returns no value.", "`fn2`: This is a function that takes no arguments and returns a `d` value.\n\nThe variable `d` is a complex data type because it is a typedef for a vector of `long` values, which is a more complex data type than a simple `long` value. The variables `fn1` and `fn2` are also complex data types because they are functions that take and return values, respectively.\n\nTherefore, the list of variables with complex data types in this program is:\n"]
