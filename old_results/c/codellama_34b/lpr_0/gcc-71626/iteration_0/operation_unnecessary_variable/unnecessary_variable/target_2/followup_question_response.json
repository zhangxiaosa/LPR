The function `fn1` is not used anywhere in the program, so it can be optimized out.\n2. The function `fn2` returns a vector of `long`s, but the function itself does not use any of the vector elements. Therefore, the function can be optimized out, and the vector can be replaced with an empty vector.\n3. The `main` function does not use any of the functions, so it can be optimized out.\n\nThe optimized program does not have any unused variables or functions, and it is much simpler and more efficient than the original program.",

The function `fn1` is not used in the program, so it is optimized out by the compiler.\n2. The function `fn2` is also optimized out, but the optimization is done by copy propagation. The return value of `fn2` is a vector of `long` values, and the function `fn1` is not used in the program, so the return value of `fn2` can be optimized out.\n3.

Constant propagation is the process of replacing constant expressions with their corresponding values during the compilation process. Copy propagation is the process of eliminating copies of values by replacing them with a reference to the original value.\n\nIn this case, the function `fn1` is not used anywhere in the program, so it is removed by constant propagation. The function `fn2` is also optimized by copy propagation, as the return value of the function is not used anywhere in the program. Instead of returning a new vector, the function simply returns an empty vector, which is more efficient.",
