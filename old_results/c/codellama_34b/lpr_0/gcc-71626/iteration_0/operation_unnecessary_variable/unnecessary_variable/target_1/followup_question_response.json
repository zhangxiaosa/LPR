Constant propagation: The function `fn1` is unused, so its definition can be removed.\n2. Copy propagation: The function `fn2` returns a constant value, which is always the same.

The function `fn1` is not used in the program, so it can be removed.\n2. The function `fn2` returns a `d` object that contains only the address of `fn1`. Since `fn1` is not used, the address is not needed, and the return value of `fn2` can be optimized to return an empty `d` object.\n3. The `main` function is empty, so it can also be removed.\n\nThe optimized program is as follows:\n```\nd fn2() { return (d){}; }\n```\nNote that the optimized program is still a valid C program, and it has the same behavior as the original program. The optimization has removed the unused function `fn1` and the unused return value of `fn2`, which improves the performance of the program.",
