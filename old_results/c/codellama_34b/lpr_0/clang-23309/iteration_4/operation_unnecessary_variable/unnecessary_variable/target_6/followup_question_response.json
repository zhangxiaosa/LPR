Constant propagation: The variable `p2` is never used in the program, so its value can be propagated to the return statement of `fn12` and the call to `fn3`, which simplifies the program.\n2. Copy propagation: The variable `an` is assigned the value of `w` in the loop, so it can be replaced with `w` in the loop body. This eliminates the need for the variable `an` and makes the program simpler.\n\nThe optimized program is shorter and simpler, and it still produces the same output as the original program.",

Constant Propagation:\nThe variable `p2` is never modified within the program, so its value is constant. We can propagate this constant value throughout the program and eliminate the variable.\n\nAfter applying constant propagation, the program becomes:\n```\nunsigned fn6(unsigned p1, unsigned p2) { return p2 - p1; }\nunsigned p;\nunsigned v;\nsigned w = 3;\nshort fn12(int p1, int p2, long p3, signed p4) {\n  int an;\n  while (w) {\n    an = 250L;\n    if (250L || (an = w)) {\n      short ao = 48873;\n      if (fn3(ao, fn6(1L, 250L)) - 250L & 1L)\n        v = 1L;\n    }\n    w--;\n  }\n  return 0;\n}\nint main() {\n  fn12(7L, 250L, 248L, 0);\n  p = v;\n  printf(\"checksum = %X\\n\", p);\n  return 0;\n}\n```\n2. Copy Propagation:\nThe variable `p2` is only used in the `fn12` function, and its value is always the same as the value of `an`, which is a local variable. We can eliminate the variable `p2` and use `an` instead.\n\nAfter applying copy propagation, the program becomes:\n```\nunsigned fn6(unsigned p1, unsigned p2) { return p2 - p1; }\nunsigned p;\nunsigned v;\nsigned w = 3;\nshort fn12(int p1, int p2, long p3, signed p4) {\n  int an;\n  while (w) {\n    an = 250L;\n    if (250L || (an = w)) {\n      short ao = 48873;\n      if (fn3(ao, fn6(1L, an)) - an & 1L)\n        v = 1L;\n    }\n    w--;\n  }\n  return 0;\n}\nint main() {\n  fn12(7L, 250L, 248L, 0);\n  p = v;\n  printf(\"checksum = %X\\n\", p);\n  return 0;\n}\n```\n3. Dead Code Elimination:\nAfter applying constant propagation and copy propagation, the variable `p2` is no longer used in the program, so we can eliminate its declaration and initialization.\n\nAfter applying dead code elimination, the program becomes:\n```\nunsigned fn6(unsigned p1, unsigned p2) { return p2 - p1; }\nunsigned p;\nunsigned v;\nsigned w = 3;\nshort fn12(int p1, long p3, signed p4) {\n  int an;\n  while (w) {\n    an = 250L;\n    if (250L || (an = w)) {\n      short ao = 48873;\n      if (fn3(ao, fn6(1L, an)) - an & 1L)\n        v = 1L;\n    }\n    w--;\n  }\n  return 0;\n}\nint main() {\n  fn12(7L, 250L, 248L, 0);\n  p = v;\n  printf(\"checksum = %X\\n\", p);\n  return 0;\n}\n```",

This involves replacing any occurrences of variables that are assigned a value but never used with their values.\n\nIn the program, the only variable that is assigned a value but never used is `v`. We can replace any occurrences of `v` with its value, which is `1L`, to obtain:\n```\nint main() {\n  fn12(7L, 7L, 248L, 0);\n  p = 1L;\n  printf(\"checksum = %X\\n\", p);\n  return 0;\n}\n```\nFinally, we can optimize the program by removing any unused variables and code. In this case, the variable `w` is never used, so we can remove its declaration and any references to it. We can also remove the while loop, as it is never entered.\n\nThe optimized program is:\n```\nint main() {\n  p = 1L;\n  printf(\"checksum = %X\\n\", p);\n  return 0;\n}\n```\nThis program is equivalent to the original program, but with the unnecessary variables and code removed.",
