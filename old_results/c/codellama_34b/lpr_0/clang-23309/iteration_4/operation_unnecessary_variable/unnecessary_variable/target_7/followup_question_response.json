Constant propagation: I have propagated the constant values of `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `p4` throughout the program. This has allowed me to simplify the expressions and eliminate unnecessary variables.\n2. Copy propagation: I have eliminated the variable `an` by propagating its value to the appropriate places in the program. This has reduced the number of variables and made the program easier to read.\n3. Dead code elimination: I have eliminated the dead code in the program, which is the code that is not executed during the program's execution. This has reduced the size of the program and made it more efficient.\n4. Unused variable elimination: I have eliminated the variable `p3`, which is not used in the program. This has reduced the number of variables and made the program easier to read.\n\nThe optimized program is shorter and more efficient than the original program. It still produces the same output as the original program, but it does so more quickly and with less memory usage.",
