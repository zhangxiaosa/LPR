This is not allowed in C, as each variable must have a unique name.\n3. The program has multiple `typedef`s with the same name (`d`, `e`, `f`, `g`). This is not allowed in C, as each `typedef` must have a unique name.\n4. The program has multiple `return` statements in a single function, which is not allowed in C. A function can only have one `return` statement.\n5. The program has multiple `if` statements with the same condition, which is not allowed in C. An `if` statement can only have one condition.\n6.
