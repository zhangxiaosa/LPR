This optimization is achieved by using the `typedef unsigned long d;` statement at the beginning of the program to create a new data type called `d` that is an alias for `unsigned long`. The `fn3` and `fn6` functions are also modified to use the `d` data type instead of `long` and `unsigned`, respectively. Additionally, the `w` variable is modified to use the `d` data type instead of `short`. The `fn12` function is also modified to use the `d` data type for its parameters and return value. Finally, the `main` function is modified to use the `d` data type for its return value.\n\nWith these changes, the optimized program should run faster and use less memory than the original program, since it uses fewer data types and eliminates the need for type casting.",
