Decomposition of the program:

int i;
int j;
int *fn2(int *p2, char p3) {
  for (p3 = 6; p3 != -7; p3--)
    j ^= fn1(p3, i) && 1L;
  return p2;
}
int main() { return 0; }

Decomposition of the program:

int i;
int j;
int *fn2(int *p2, char p3) {
  for (p3 = 6; p3 != -7; p3--)
    j ^= fn1(p3, i) && 1L;
  return p2;
}
int main() { return 0; }

Variable i is of type int and has a value of 0.

Variable j is of type int and has a value of 0.

Variable p3 is of type int and has a value of 6.

Variable p2 is of type int and has a value of 0.

Function fn1 takes two arguments, p1 and p2, and returns the product of p1 and p2.

Function fn2 takes two arguments, p2 and p3, and returns the value of p2.

The program has a loop that iterates 6 times, each time setting the value of p3 to 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, and 0, respectively.

Inside the loop, the expression j ^= fn1(p3, i) && 1L is evaluated. The value of j is XORed with the result of fn1(p3, i) and 1L. The result of fn1(p3, i) is the product of p3 and i. The expression 1L is a 32-bit integer with all bits set to 1.

The loop terminates when p3 is -7.

The program returns 0.
