The `p2_local` variable is then used in place of `p2` in the function `fn2`. This optimization has been done to prevent the creation of unnecessary pointers and to improve the performance of the program.\n\nAdditionally, the `fn1` function has been inlined, which means that the function call has been replaced with the actual code of the function. This optimization has been done to reduce the overhead of function calls and to improve the performance of the program.\n\nThe program has also been modified to use the `limits.h` header file, which provides the `CHAR_BIT` constant that represents the number of bits in a `char` type. This constant is used in the `fn1` function to ensure that the multiplication operation is performed correctly.\n\nOverall, the optimized program should run faster and more efficiently than the original program, while still producing the same output.",
