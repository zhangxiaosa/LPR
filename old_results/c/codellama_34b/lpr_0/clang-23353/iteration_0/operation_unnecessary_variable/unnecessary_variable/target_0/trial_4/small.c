In this optimized program, the variable `p3` is assigned a new value of `6` and is used as a loop counter in the for loop. The value of `p3` is not used after the loop, so we can optimize it out by assigning it to a new variable `p3` with the same value.

Note that we can also use copy propagation to optimize out the variable `p3`. Since the variable `p3` is not used outside of the loop, we can replace all occurrences of `p3` with `6` after the loop. This will eliminate the need for the variable `p3` altogether.

Here is an example of how we can use copy propagation to optimize out the variable `p3`:
