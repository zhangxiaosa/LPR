The only change made to the original program was to replace the function call `fn1(p3, i)` with the inline definition of `fn1`, which is simply `p3 * i`.\n\nThis optimization can be done because `fn1` is a pure function, meaning that it has no side effects and its output only depends on its inputs. Inlining a pure function can often improve performance by reducing the overhead of a function call.",
