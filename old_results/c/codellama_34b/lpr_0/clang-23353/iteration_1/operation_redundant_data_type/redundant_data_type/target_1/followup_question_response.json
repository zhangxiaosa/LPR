The `char` data type is a built-in data type in C, and it is typically used to represent a single character. However, in this program, it is used to represent a small integer value, which is not appropriate. Replacing it with `int` makes the program more efficient and readable.\n\nThe changes made in the program are:\n\n* In the function `fn1`, the parameter `p1` and `p2` are changed from `char` to `int`.\n* In the function `fn2`, the parameter `p3` is changed from `char` to `int`.\n* The variable `j` is changed from `struct g` to `struct g { int h; }`.\n* The variable `i` is changed from `int` to `int`.\n* The return value of `fn2` is changed from `int *` to `int`.\n\nNote that the return value of `fn2` is still a pointer to an `int`, but the pointer itself is not modified. The variable `j` is still a struct of type `g`, but the member `h` is now an `int` instead of a `char`.",
