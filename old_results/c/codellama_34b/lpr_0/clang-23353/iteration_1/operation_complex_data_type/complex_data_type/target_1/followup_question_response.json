The main function initializes the `i` variable to 0, creates a `struct g` object `j` with `h` set to 0, and calls the `fn2` function with `p1` set to 1, `p2` set to the address of `j`, and `p3` set to 6.\n\nThe optimization was achieved by removing the unnecessary variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, and by rewriting the code to use more efficient data types.

The program uses the following memory:\n\n* `struct g` uses 4 bytes of memory for the member `h`.\n* `i` uses 4 bytes of memory.\n* `j` uses 4 bytes of memory for the member `h`.\n* `fn1` uses 8 bytes of memory for the return value.\n* `fn2` uses 8 bytes of memory for the return value.\n\nTherefore, the total memory usage of the program is 4 + 4 + 4 + 8 + 8 = 24 bytes.\n\nSecondly, we need to analyze the access patterns of the program. The program accesses the following variables:\n\n* `j.h` is accessed in the `fn1` function.\n* `i` is accessed in the `fn1` function.\n* `j` is accessed in the `fn2` function.\n* `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are accessed in the `fn2` function.\n\nThe access patterns of the program can be optimized by using a more efficient data structure for the variable `j`.\n\nOne possible optimization is to use a union for the variable `j` instead of a structure. A union allows us to store multiple data types in the same memory location, which can reduce memory usage and improve cache performance.\n\nHere is the optimized program:\n```\nstruct g {\n  union {\n    signed h;\n    int i;\n  };\n};\nint main() { return 0; }\n```\nIn this optimized program, we use a union to store the member `h` of type `signed` and the member `i` of type `int`. This allows us to access both members using the same memory location, which can improve cache performance.\n\nWe have optimized the program by decomposing the variable `j` into its primary data type components and analyzing the memory usage and access patterns of the program. By using a union for the variable `j`, we have reduced the memory usage of the program and improved cache performance.",
