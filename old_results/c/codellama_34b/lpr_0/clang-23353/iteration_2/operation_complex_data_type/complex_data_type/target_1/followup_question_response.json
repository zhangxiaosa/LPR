The result of this expression is assigned to `i` directly, eliminating the need to call `fn1` at runtime.\n\nThe function `fn2` is also optimized by using the `^=` operator instead of `=` to update the value of `j`. This allows the compiler to generate more efficient code for the loop.\n\nThe variable `p2` is initialized to `NULL` to avoid potential issues with dangling pointers.\n\nOverall, this optimized program should run faster and use less memory than the original program.",

In order to avoid any potential aliasing issues, we have also added a `*` operator before `i_ptr` in the assignment statement.\n\nFinally, in `main`, we have added a line `i_ptr = &i` to initialize `i_ptr` to point to `i`, and we have modified the call to `fn2` to pass `i_ptr` as an argument.\n\nWith these changes, the program should now be free of any aliasing issues, and `i` can be optimized without affecting the correctness of the program.",
