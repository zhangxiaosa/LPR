Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. Remove the `goto q` statement by replacing it with a loop structure. This will eliminate the need for jumping back to the label `q`.\n\n2. Unroll the loop by manually repeating the loop body multiple times. Since the loop condition `if (g)` depends on the global variable `g`, we can replace it with a constant value to ensure the loop is unrolled a fixed number of times.\n\n3. Initialize the loop counter `k` outside the loop and set it to the initial value `0x24F96B7B`. This will ensure that the loop starts with the same counter value as the original program.\n\n4. Modify the loop body to perform the required operations. In this case, the loop body contains a right shift of `k` and a left shift of `k` by the value of `j`.\n\n5. Decrement the loop counter `g` by 1 at the end of each iteration to ensure termination.\n\n6. Remove the unnecessary `if (j)` condition before decrementing `j`.\n\n7.
