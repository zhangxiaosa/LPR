The variable `j` is initialized with the hexadecimal value `0x24F96B7B`. This value is used in the conditional statement `if (j)`, but since `j` is not modified before this condition, we can determine that `j` will always be non-zero. Therefore, the decrement operation `--j` can be removed, as it has no effect. The resulting code becomes `int j = 0x24F96B7B;`.\n\n3. The variable `k` is declared but not initialized. Its value is used in the conditional statement `if (g)`. Since we have removed the unused variable `g`, this condition will always be false. Therefore, the code block inside the `if` statement, including the `k = k << j;` statement and the `goto q;` statement, can be safely removed.\n\n4. The variable `k` is assigned the value `k >> 1L;` outside the `if` statement. Since `k` is not initialized, its value is undefined.
