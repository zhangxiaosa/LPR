Loop unrolling is a technique that reduces the loop overhead by executing multiple iterations of the loop body in each iteration. Here's the step-by-step analysis and modification of the program:\n\n1. Define a constant variable `UNROLL_FACTOR` to determine how many times the loop should be unrolled. Choose a suitable value for `UNROLL_FACTOR` based on the performance requirements.\n\n2. Calculate the number of iterations in the original loop by dividing `j` by `UNROLL_FACTOR` and store it in a new variable `numIterations`.\n\n3. Initialize a new variable `unrolledIterations` with the value of `numIterations` multiplied by `UNROLL_FACTOR`.\n\n4. Modify the loop condition to `j > unrolledIterations`. This ensures that the loop will execute until the original number of iterations is completed.\n\n5. Modify the loop increment to `j -= UNROLL_FACTOR`. This decreases `j` by `UNROLL_FACTOR` in each iteration.\n\n6. Unroll the loop by manually executing the loop body `UNROLL_FACTOR` times in each iteration, replacing the original loop body with the unrolled code. Make sure to update any variables used in the loop body accordingly.\n\n7.
