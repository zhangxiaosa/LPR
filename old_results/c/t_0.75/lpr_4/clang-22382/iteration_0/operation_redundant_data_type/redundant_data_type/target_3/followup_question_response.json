We have a program with several typedef declarations and a data type `d` that needs to be eliminated and substituted with its associated original data type.\n2. The program also includes a struct `h` with multiple members (`i`, `j`, and `k`) of different data types.\n3. The program has two functions: `fn2` and `fn1`.\n4. The `fn2` function has a parameter `p1` of type `e`, which needs to be substituted with its associated original data type.\n5. Inside `fn2`, there is a variable `q` that needs to replace the data type `b` with `int`.\n6. The `fn1` function is defined after `fn2` and has parameters `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `p4`, and `p5`.\n7. The `fn1` function also has a statement `p5.k` which accesses the member `k` of the `p5` struct.\n8.
