The target variable is `p2`, which is passed as an argument to the function `fn1()` in the `fn2()` function.\n\n2. In the `fn2()` function, `p2` is passed as the second argument to `fn1()`, but it is not used within `fn1()`. Therefore, we can optimize out the unused parameter `p2` in `fn1()`.\n\n3. Since `p2` is not used in `fn1()`, we can remove it from the parameter list and the function definition.\n\n4. After removing `p2` from `fn1()`, the updated function definition becomes:\n\n```c\nstatic struct h fn1(unsigned, unsigned, unsigned, struct h);\n```\n\n5. We can also remove the unused variable `q` in the `fn2()` function, as it is not used anywhere.\n\n6. After removing `q`, the updated `fn2()` function becomes:\n\n```c\nunsigned fn2() {\n  struct h p;\n  fn1(l, 3, 3, p);\n  for (;;) {\n    struct h r;\n    p = r = p;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n7. Finally, we can remove the `unsigned` return type from the `fn2()` function, as it does not return any value.\n\n8.
