The `fn2` function calls `fn1` with the variable `q`, the constant `3`, and the variable `p` as arguments.\n2. The `fn1` function receives the arguments `p1`, `p3`, and `p5`, but it only accesses the member `k` of `p5`, which is unused.\n3. The `fn2` function enters an infinite loop with the `for` statement. Inside the loop, it creates a new variable `r` of type `struct h` and assigns `p` to `r`. Then, it assigns `r` back to `p`, effectively copying the value of `p` to itself.\n4.

Inside `fn1()`, the statement `p5.k;` does not have any effect and can be removed.\n3. The function `fn1()` has an infinite loop with the label `w` and a goto statement `goto w;`. This loop does not modify or use the variable `p5`, so we can conclude that `p5` is unused within `fn1()`.\n4. In the `fn2()` function, the variable `p` of type `struct h` is declared.\n5. The function `fn1()` is called with parameters `q`, `3`, and `p`. Since `p5` is not used within `fn1()`, the value of `p` passed as an argument is not relevant.\n6. The `for` loop in `fn2()` initializes a new variable `r` of type `struct h` and assigns `p` to `r`.\n7. The assignment `p = r = p;` can be simplified to `p = r;` since the value of `p` is already assigned to `r`.\n8. The loop continues indefinitely, repeatedly assigning `p` to `r`, which doesn't affect the value of `p`.\n9.
