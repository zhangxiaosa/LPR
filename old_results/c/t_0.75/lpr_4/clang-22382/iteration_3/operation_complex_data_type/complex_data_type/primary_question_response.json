Here is the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. We start by examining the program's global scope (outside any function):\n\n   - No variables are declared in the global scope. Therefore, no complex data types are identified.\n\n2. Next, we analyze the `struct` definition:\n\n   - The `struct h` definition declares three variables: `i`, `j`, and `k`.\n   - These variables have primitive data types (`int` and `long`), not complex data types.\n\n3. Moving on to the `fn1` function:\n\n   - The parameter `p5` is of type `struct h`, which is a complex data type.\n   - However, the variable `p5` is not used in the function body, so it can be ignored.\n\n4. Analyzing the `fn2` function:\n\n   - The function returns an `unsigned` value, which is a primitive data type.\n   - The function declares a local variable `p` of type `struct h`, which is a complex data type.\n   - The function calls `fn1` with the `p` variable as an argument, which is a complex data type.\n   - Inside an infinite loop, the function declares a local variable `r` of type `struct h`, which is a complex data type.\n\n5. Finally, we examine the `main` function:\n\n   - The `main` function has no variable declarations.\n\nBased on the analysis, the identified variables with complex data types are `fn2`'s local variables `p` and `r`. Now, let's write the identified variables into a JSON file:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"target_list\": [\"p\", \"r\"]\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that the JSON file represents a dictionary object with a single key-value pair.

The program defines a structure named `h` with three members: `i` of type `int`, `j` of type `long`, and `k` of type `int`.\n2.

Inside the `fn1` function, there is an expression `p5.k`, but it doesn't have any effect on the program.\n4. There is a label `w` followed by a `goto` statement `goto w;` which creates an infinite loop in the `fn1` function.\n5. The program declares an `unsigned` function `fn2` that doesn't take any parameters and returns an `unsigned` value.\n6. Inside the `fn2` function, it declares a variable `p` of type `struct h` and calls the `fn1` function passing `p` as an argument.\n7.
