The program starts with a struct definition of type `struct h` with three members: `int i`, `long j`, and `int k`.\n2. The function `fn1` is defined, which takes an `unsigned` integer `p1` and a `struct h` `p5` as arguments. The return type of `fn1` is `static struct h`.\n3. Inside `fn1`, there is an expression `p5.k`, but it doesn't assign the result to any variable or use it further, so it can be considered redundant.\n4. The label `w` and the `goto` statement `goto w` appear, but they are not related to any data type and can be ignored for this analysis.\n5. The function `fn2` is defined with a return type of `unsigned`.\n6. Inside `fn2`, a variable `p` of type `struct h` is declared.\n7. The function `fn1` is called with arguments `3` and `p`. The return value of `fn1` is not used.\n8. Inside an infinite loop `for (;;)`, a variable `r` of type `struct h` is declared. `p` and `r` are assigned the same value: `p = r = p`. This assignment is redundant as it assigns the same value to both variables.\n9. The `main` function is defined with a return type of `int`.\n10.
