In the `fn1` function, the statement `p5.k;` does not have any side effects and does not contribute to the program's behavior. It can be removed.\n\n3. In the `fn2` function, the `fn1` function is called with the variable `p` as an argument. However, the result of the `fn1` function call is not used. Since `p5` is the argument passed to `fn1`, and it is not used within `fn1`, the entire `fn1(p);` statement can be removed.\n\n4. In the `fn2` function, the loop `for (;;) { ... }` does not have any side effects. The assignments `p = r = p;` do not affect the program's behavior since `p` and `r` are not used outside the loop. The entire loop can be optimized out.\n\n5. In the `main` function, there is no usage of `p5` or any call to `fn2`.

This statement can be considered unused code and can be removed.\n\n2. The function `fn2` calls `fn1` with the variable `p` as an argument. Since `p5` is not used within `fn1`, the call to `fn1` with `p` can be considered unnecessary and can be removed.\n\n3. The variable `p` is used within a loop in `fn2`. It is assigned the value of another variable `r`, which is then assigned back to `p`. This assignment operation can be considered as copy propagation, where the value of `r` is copied to `p`. However, since `p5` is not used within the loop or anywhere else in the program, the assignment to `p` can also be considered unnecessary and can be removed.\n\n4.
