The program includes the standard input/output library `stdio.h`.\n2. It defines a structure `h` with three members: `i` of type `int`, `j` of type `long`, and `k` of type `int`.\n3. It declares a static function `fn1` that takes three parameters: `p1` of type `unsigned`, `p3` of type `unsigned`, and `p5` of type `struct h`. The function returns a value of type `struct h`.\n4.

Inside the `fn2` function, a variable `p` of type `struct h` and a variable `q` of type `int` are declared.\n8. The `fn1` function is called with arguments `q`, `3`, and `p`.\n9.
