Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:\n\n1. In the declaration `struct m ad = {1957};`, `ad.o` is initialized to `0` because it's a bit field and only takes 1 bit.\n\n2. The function `fn1(v, 5)` is called and assigned to `ad.o`. Since the value of `v` is not provided in the program, we cannot perform constant propagation here. Therefore, we keep it as it is.\n\n3. The variable `af` is assigned the value of `t`, which is uninitialized in the program. Without further information, we cannot propagate a constant here.\n\n4. The value of `ad.o` is assigned to `ae`. Since `ad.o` is already assigned the value of `fn1(v, 5)`, we can replace `ae` with `ad.o`.\n\n5. The value of `u` is assigned to `ad.o`. We cannot propagate a constant here since the value of `u` is not known.\n\n6. The expression `af % (~s / ae)` is assigned to `r`. Since `ae` is replaced with `ad.o`, the expression becomes `af % (~s / ad.o)`.\n\n7. The value of `ad.o` is not used after `r = af % (~s / ad.o)`.
