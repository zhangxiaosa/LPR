Replace the function call `fn1(v, 5)` with the constant value `5` since the result of the function call is assigned to `ad.o` but `ad.o` is not used later in the program.\n\n3. Replace the variable `ae` with the constant value `5` since it is assigned the value of `ad.o`, which has been replaced with the constant `5`.\n\n4. Simplify the expression `~s / ae` by evaluating the constant `~s` as `-(-5L + 1)` which is `4`. The expression simplifies to `4 / ae`.\n\n5. Calculate the constant value of `4 / ae` as `4 / 5`, which is `0`.\n\n6. Replace the expression `t % (4 / ae)` with the constant value `t % 0`. Division by `0` is undefined, so this expression can be optimized to `0`.\n\n7.

Constant Propagation:\n   - The variable `s` is a static variable with a constant value of -5.\n   - The value of `ae` is obtained from `ad.o`, which is assigned the value of `u`. If `u` is a constant, we can propagate that constant value to `ae`.\n   - The value of `t` is not provided in the given code, so we cannot perform constant propagation for `t`.\n   - The expression `~s` can be evaluated as `4` (assuming a 32-bit integer representation).\n   - The expression `~s / ae` can be evaluated as `4 / ae`.\n\n2. Copy Propagation:\n   - The expression `t % (4 / ae)` can be replaced with `t % (4 / u)` if `u` is a constant.\n\nAs there are some uncertainties in the code (e.g., the value of `t` and whether `u` is a constant), the optimization steps may vary.
