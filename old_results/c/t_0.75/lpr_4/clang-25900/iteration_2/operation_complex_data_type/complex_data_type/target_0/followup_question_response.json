Remove the unused variable `t` since it doesn't affect the target variable `ad`.\n3. Remove the unused variable `ae` since it doesn't affect the target variable `ad`.\n4. Remove the unused function `fn1` since it doesn't affect the target variable `ad`.\n5. Remove the unused bit-field member `n` of `struct m` since it doesn't affect the target variable `ad`.\n6.
