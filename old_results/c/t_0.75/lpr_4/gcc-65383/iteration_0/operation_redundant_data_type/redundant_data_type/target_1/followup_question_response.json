It declares a variable `g` of type `d`.\n5. It declares an integer array `h` initialized with three values.\n6. It declares a static variable `i` of type `d` and initializes it with a value.\n7. It defines a function `fn2` that returns a value of type `d`.\n   - Inside the function, it defines a variable `q` of type `c` and initializes it with a value.\n   - It declares a multi-dimensional integer array `r`.\n   - It checks the value of `h[2]` in an `if` statement.\n   - If the condition is true, it returns the value of `q`.\n   - Otherwise, it assigns `r[i][i][i]` to the variable `g`.\n8.
