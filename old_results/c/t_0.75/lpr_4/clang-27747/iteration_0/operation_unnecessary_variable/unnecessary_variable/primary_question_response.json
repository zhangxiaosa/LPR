Define a struct named \"c\" with five integer members: \"d\", \"e\", \"f\", \"g\", and \"h\".\n2. Declare two variables of type \"struct c\" named \"i\" and \"j\".\n3. Define the main function with return type int.\n4. Declare a local variable of type \"struct c\" named \"l\" and initialize it with values 24, 6738, and 165.\n5. Declare a local variable of type int named \"m\" and assign the value of \"j.e\" to it.\n6. Assign the value of \"m\" to \"l.d\".\n7. Declare a local variable of type int named \"n\" and assign the result of the logical AND operation between \"j.h\" and \"l.d\" to it.\n8.
