Let's analyze the variable `j` for copy propagation.\n\n1. The variable `j` is initialized as a global variable and assigned values in the main function.\n2.

The variable `l.d` is used in the expression `p = l.d | -(l.f && l.d) - n`.\n5. Finally, the variable `p` is assigned to `j.g`.\n\nBased on the analysis, the variable `j` is used multiple times throughout the program. Therefore, copy propagation cannot optimize it out.\n\nStep 3: Unused Variable Optimization\n\nIf the variable `j` is unused in the program, we can safely remove it to optimize the code.
