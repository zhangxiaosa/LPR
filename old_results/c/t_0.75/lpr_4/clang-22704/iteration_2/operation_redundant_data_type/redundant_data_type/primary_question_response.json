The program defines two variables `f_d` and `f_e` of type `int`.\n2. The program defines a function `fn1` that returns a `char` data type.\n3. Inside the `fn1` function, there is an `if` statement that checks the value of `f_e`.\n4. The `if` statement is followed by a `goto` statement which jumps to the label `i`.\n5. After the `goto` statement, there is a recursive call to the `fn1` function.\n6. The `fn1` function returns the value `537164773` after the recursive call.\n7. The label `i` is defined, and after that, the variable `f_d` is assigned the value `6`.\n8. Another recursive call to the `fn1` function is made.\n9.
