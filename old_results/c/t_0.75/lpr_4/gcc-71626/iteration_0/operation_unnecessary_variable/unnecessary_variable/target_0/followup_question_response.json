Therefore, constant propagation cannot be used to determine the value of `c` at compile time.\n\n2. Since `fn1` is an empty function and does not have any side effects, we can conclude that the variable `c` is unused in the `fn2` function. Therefore, we can optimize it out by removing the assignment and declaration of `c`.\n\n3. The `fn2` function now becomes:\n```c\nd fn2() {\n  d f = {0};\n  return f;\n}\n```\n\n4.
