The `typedef long d __attribute__((__vector_size__(sizeof(long))));` line defines a new type `d` which is a complex data type represented by a vector of `long` values. Since the size of `long` is implementation-dependent, we can assume `d` to be an array of `long` values.\n2. The `fn2` function returns a value of type `d`, which means it returns an array of `long` values.\n3. The `c` variable inside `fn2` is of type `long`. This is a primary data type.\n4.
