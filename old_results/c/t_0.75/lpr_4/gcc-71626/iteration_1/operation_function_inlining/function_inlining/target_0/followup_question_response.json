The target function to be optimized is `fn1`.\n2. The function `fn1` is empty, so it can be safely removed without affecting the program's behavior.\n3. The function `fn2` calls `fn1` and assigns its value to a variable `c`.\n4. The variable `c` is then used to initialize a vector `f`.\n5. Finally, the vector `f` is returned from the `fn2` function.\n6. The `main` function is empty and does not have any impact on the optimization.\n\nTo optimize out the function `fn1`, we can inline its usage in the `fn2` function and remove the `fn1` function itself.
