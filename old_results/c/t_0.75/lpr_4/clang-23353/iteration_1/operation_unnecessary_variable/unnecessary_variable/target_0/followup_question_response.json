The function `fn1` multiplies two `char` values and returns the result. Since the result is not used in the program, we can eliminate the function call as well.\n\n3.

We can propagate the constant values and replace `p3` with its initial value `6` in the loop.\n\n4. The loop condition `p3 != -7` will always evaluate to `true` because `p3` is initialized as `6` and decremented until it becomes `-7`. Therefore, the loop will execute indefinitely.\n\n5. The expression `fn1(p3, i) && 1L` is equivalent to `p3 * i && 1L`.
