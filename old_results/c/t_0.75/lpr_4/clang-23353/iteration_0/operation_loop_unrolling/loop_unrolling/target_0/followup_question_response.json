Replace the target loop with the unrolled loop body:\n```cpp\nj.h ^= fn1(6, i) && 1L;\nj.h ^= fn1(5, i) && 1L;\nj.h ^= fn1(4, i) && 1L;\nj.h ^= fn1(3, i) && 1L;\nj.h ^= fn1(2, i) && 1L;\nj.h ^= fn1(1, i) && 1L;\n```\n\n2. Remove the loop initialization `p3 = 6` and the loop condition `p3 != -7` since they are no longer needed.\n\n3. Update the return type of `main()` to `int` since it is missing in the original code.\n\n4. The modified program:\n\n```cpp\ntypedef char a;\ntypedef int b;\n\na fn1(a p1, a p2) {\n  return p1 * p2;\n}\n\nstruct g {\n  signed h;\n};\n\nb i;\nstruct g j;\n\nint main() {\n  j.h ^= fn1(6, i) && 1L;\n  j.h ^= fn1(5, i) && 1L;\n  j.h ^= fn1(4, i) && 1L;\n  j.h ^= fn1(3, i) && 1L;\n  j.h ^= fn1(2, i) && 1L;\n  j.h ^= fn1(1, i) && 1L;\n\n  return 0;\n}\n```\n\n5.
