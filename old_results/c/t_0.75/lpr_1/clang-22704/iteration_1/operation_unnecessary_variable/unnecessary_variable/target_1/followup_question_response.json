The variable `f_e` is declared at the beginning of the program but is not initialized to any value.\n2. In the `fn1()` function, there is an `if` statement that checks the value of `f_e`.

The `main()` function is empty.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that `f_e` is only used in the `if` statement condition and has no effect on the program's behavior since it is never initialized.

The variable `f_e` is used in the `if` condition in the `fn1()` function. If the condition evaluates to true (non-zero), the program jumps to the label `i`.
