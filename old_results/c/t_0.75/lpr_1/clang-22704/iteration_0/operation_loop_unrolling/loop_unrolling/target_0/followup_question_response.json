The program defines a few type aliases: `a` is typedef'd as `int`, and `b` is typedef'd as `char`.\n\n2. The program also defines a structure `c` with two members: `d` of type `a` and `e` of type `a`. An instance of this structure, `f`, is declared.\n\n3. The `fn1()` function is defined, which returns a value of type `b`. It contains the following steps:\n   a. Variable `h` of type `a` is declared and assigned the value `6L`.\n   b. An `if` condition checks if `f.e` is nonzero. If it is, the program jumps to label `i`.\n   c. The `fn1()` function is called recursively.\n   d. Variable `j` of type `b` is declared.\n   e. The value of `j` is returned.\n\n4. Label `i` is defined, where the following steps are performed:\n   a. The value of `h` is assigned to `f.d`.\n   b. The `fn1()` function is called recursively.\n   c. Variable `j` is assigned the value `0xEEACFBBFL`.\n   d. The value of `j` is returned.\n\n5.

Remove the `if` statement and the `goto` statement.\n\n   The `if` statement checks the value of `f.e` and then jumps to the `i` label. Since the `if` statement is followed by a recursive call, we assume that the `goto` statement is used to skip the recursive call if the condition is true.
