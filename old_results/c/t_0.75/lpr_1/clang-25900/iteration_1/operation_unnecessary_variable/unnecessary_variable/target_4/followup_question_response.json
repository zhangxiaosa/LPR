The value of `t` is divided by the result of `~s / ae` and the modulus operation is performed with the result.

Since the variable `t` is not used after its declaration, it can be removed.\n2. The function `fn1(p2)` returns its argument `p2` as an `unsigned` value. So, the assignment `ad.o = fn1(5)` can be simplified to `ad.o = 5`.\n3. The variable `ae` is assigned the value of `ad.o`, which is 5. So, the assignment `ae = ad.o` can be simplified to `ae = 5`.\n4. The expression `~s` is equivalent to `~(-5L)`, which is the two's complement negation of -5. Since `s` is a signed variable, its value is constant and known at compile-time. So, we can replace `~s` with the constant value 4 (assuming `int` is 32 bits).\n5. The expression `~s / ae` can be simplified to `4 / 5`, which evaluates to 0 (integer division).\n6. The assignment `r = t % (~s / ae)` can be simplified to `r = 0` since `t` is not used and the result of the expression is always 0.\n7.
