Here is the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. In the `fn13` function, the variable `af` is assigned the constant value `0x2F2F6D26`.\n2. The `fn12` function is called with arguments `2`, `ag`, `t`, `1`, and `1`. The variable `t` is not assigned any value before this function call.\n3. Inside the `fn12` function, there is a loop that iterates while `w` is non-zero. The loop variable `w` is initially assigned the value `3`.\n4. Inside the loop, there is an `if` statement that checks if `an` is equal to `250`. If so, it performs some operations and assignments.\n5. However, the condition `if (an = 250)` is never true because `an` is not assigned any value before this check.\n6. Therefore, the block of code inside the `if` statement is never executed, and the assignments to `p2` and `v` inside that block are not reached.\n7. After the loop, the function `fn12` returns the value `3`.\n8. In the `main` function, the `fn13` function is called, and its return value is ignored.\n9. After the `fn13` function call, the variable `p` is assigned the value of `v`.\n10. Finally, the value of `p` is printed using the `printf` function.\n\nSince the variable `af` is never used after its assignment, it can be optimized out.
