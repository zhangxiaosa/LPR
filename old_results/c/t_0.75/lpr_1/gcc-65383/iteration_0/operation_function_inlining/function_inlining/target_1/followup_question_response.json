The program starts with several type definitions and variable declarations. These do not need any modifications for function inlining.\n\n2. The target function to be optimized is `fn2()`. Let's analyze it:\n   - It starts with an infinite loop using `for (;;)`.\n   - Inside the loop, a local variable `q` of type `c` (unsigned) is declared and initialized with the value `0xC3L`.\n   - An array `r` of type `b` (signed) with dimensions 5x9x5 is declared.\n   - If the value at index 2 of the array `h` is non-zero, the function returns `q`.\n   - Otherwise, the value at index `i` of the 3-dimensional array `r` is assigned to the global variable `g`.\n   - Finally, the function returns the value of the global variable `j`.\n\n3. In order to inline the `fn2()` function, we need to replace all the function calls to `fn2()` with the body of the function itself. In this case, since `fn2()` has no function calls, we can simply replace the `main()` function with the body of `fn2()`.\n\n4. Perform the following modifications:\n   - Remove the `int main() { fn2(); }` part.\n   - Replace it with the body of `fn2()`:\n     ```cpp\n     for (;;) {\n       c q = 0xC3L;\n       b r[5][9][5];\n       if (h[2])\n         return q;\n       g = r[i][i][i];\n     }\n     return j;\n     ```\n\n5. The final optimized program, with the `main()` function replaced by the inlined `fn2()` code, is as follows:\n\n```cpp\ntypedef signed a;\ntypedef int b;\ntypedef unsigned c;\ntypedef unsigned d;\nb e;\nc f;\nd g;\nb h[] = {0x92A1D2CDL, 0x92A1D2CDL, 0x92A1D2CDL};\nstatic d i = 0x06D7L;\nb j;\n\n// Inlined fn2() function\nfor (;;) {\n  c q = 0xC3L;\n  b r[5][9][5];\n  if (h[2])\n    return q;\n  g = r[i][i][i];\n}\nreturn j;\n```\n\n6.
