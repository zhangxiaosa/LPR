The target variable to optimize is `r`.\n2. Since `r` is a local variable declared inside the `fn2` function, it is not accessible outside of the function. Therefore, there is no need to optimize it from a global perspective.\n3. Within the `fn2` function, `r` is only used in one location: `g = r[0x06D7L][0x06D7L][0x06D7L]`. This line assigns a value from `r` to the global variable `g`.\n4. The loop `for (;;) { ... }` indicates an infinite loop, so the statement `g = r[0x06D7L][0x06D7L][0x06D7L]` will be executed repeatedly.\n5. Since the value of `r` is not modified within the loop, and it is not used anywhere else in the program, we can optimize it out.\n6.
