The program starts with three typedef statements that define the data types `a`, `b`, and `c`. These are the only redundant data types in the program.\n2. The program continues with three more typedef statements that define the data types `d`, `e`, and `f`.\n3. Next, there is a struct declaration `struct h` that defines a structure with three members: `i` of type `signed int`, `j` of type `c` (which is `long`), and `k` of type `unsigned int`.\n4. After the struct declaration, there is a variable declaration `d l;` which declares a variable `l` of type `d` (which is `unsigned`).\n5. Then, there is a function declaration `static struct h fn1(f, a, g, d, struct h);` which defines a function `fn1` that takes five arguments: `f`, `a`, `g`, `d`, and `struct h`. The function returns a value of type `struct h`.\n6. The program continues with another function declaration `e fn2(p1) { ... }` which defines a function `fn2` that takes one argument `p1`. The function returns a value of type `e` (which is `unsigned`).\n7. Inside the `fn2` function, there is a variable declaration `struct h p;` which declares a variable `p` of type `struct h`.\n8. Then, there is another variable declaration `b q;` which declares a variable `q` of type `b` (which is `int`).\n9. The `fn1` function is called with five arguments: `q`, `l`, `p1`, `3`, and `p`.\n10. Inside a for-loop, there is a variable declaration `struct h r;` which declares a variable `r` of type `struct h`.\n11. The value of `r` is assigned to `p`, and the value of `p` is assigned to `r`. This assignment appears to be redundant and has no effect.\n12. The `fn1` function is defined after the `fn2` function. The definition matches the declaration seen earlier.\n13. The `fn1` function definition includes a statement `p5.k;` which doesn't have any effect.\n14. The `fn1` function ends with a label `w:` and a goto statement `goto w;`. This creates an infinite loop.\n15. Finally, there is a `main` function declaration `int main() {}` which doesn't have any statements.\n\nBased on this analysis, the redundant data types are `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.
