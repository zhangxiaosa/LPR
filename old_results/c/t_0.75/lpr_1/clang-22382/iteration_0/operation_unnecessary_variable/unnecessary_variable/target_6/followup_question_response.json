The target variable to be optimized is `r` in the `fn2` function.\n2. The `fn2` function calls the `fn1` function and assigns the return value to `p`.\n3. The `fn1` function takes three parameters: `p1`, `p2`, and `p5`.\n4. In the `fn1` function, the `p5.k` statement does not have any effect since its value is not used or assigned to any variable.\n5. The `fn1` function contains an infinite loop labeled `w` and a `goto` statement that jumps back to the `w` label.\n6. Inside the infinite loop, there is a redundant assignment `p = r = p`, which assigns the value of `p` to `r` and then assigns the value of `r` back to `p`.\n\nOptimization:\n\n1. The `p5.k` statement in the `fn1` function can be removed since it has no effect.\n2.
