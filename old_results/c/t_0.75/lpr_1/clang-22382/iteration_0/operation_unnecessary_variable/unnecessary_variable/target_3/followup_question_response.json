The variable `p3` is passed as an argument to the function `fn1()`.\n2. In the function `fn1()`, the statement `p5.k;` accesses the member `k` of the struct `p5`, but it doesn't use the value.\n3. The `goto w;` statement creates an infinite loop in `fn1()`, so the subsequent code is never executed.\n4.
