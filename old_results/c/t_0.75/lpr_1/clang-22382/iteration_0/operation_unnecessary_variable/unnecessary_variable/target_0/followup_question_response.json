From the given program, we can see that `p` is assigned in the function `fn2` and used as an argument in the function `fn1`. Let's break down the steps for the optimization process:\n\n1. Identify assignments to `p`:\n   - In the function `fn2`, `p` is assigned the value of `r`, which is also assigned the value of `p`.\n   - The assignment `p = r = p` can be simplified to `p = r`.\n\n2.

Apply the optimizations:\n   - In the function `fn2`, replace the assignment `p = r = p` with `p = r`.\n\n4.
