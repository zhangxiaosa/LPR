Variables declared with complex data types include structures, classes, arrays, and pointers. Here is the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. The program defines a structure `h` with three members: `i` (short), `j` (long), and `k` (unsigned).\n2. There is a variable `l` of type `unsigned`.\n3. The function `fn1` is declared, which takes five parameters: `p1` (unsigned), `p2` (short), `p3` (unsigned), `p4` (unsigned), and `p5` (struct h).\n4. The function `fn2` is defined, which takes one parameter `p1`. It declares variables `p` (struct h) and `q` (int). It calls the `fn1` function with several arguments.\n5. Inside the `fn2` function, there is an infinite loop (`for (;;)`). Inside the loop, a variable `r` (struct h) is declared. The variables `p` and `r` are assigned to each other.\n6. The `fn1` function is defined and takes the same parameters as declared earlier. It references the member `k` of the `p5` structure.\n7. The `fn1` function contains an infinite loop labeled `w` which uses the `goto` statement to jump back to the label `w`.\n\nBased on this analysis, the variables with complex data types are `h`, `l`, `p`, `q`, `r`, and `p5`.
