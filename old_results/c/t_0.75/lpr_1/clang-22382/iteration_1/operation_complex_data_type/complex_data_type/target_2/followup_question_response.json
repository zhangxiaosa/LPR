Inside `fn2`, declare a struct `h` variable `p` and an int variable `q`.\n7. Call the function `fn1` with parameters `q`, `l`, and `p`.\n8. Enter an infinite loop (`for (;;)`) and declare a struct `h` variable `r`.\n9. Assign `p` to `r`, and then assign `r` back to `p` (`p = r = p`).\n10. Define the `main` function, which returns an int.
