The function contains an infinite loop with a `goto` statement.\n3. The program defines another function `fn2` that returns an `unsigned` value. Inside this function, a struct `H` variable `p` is declared. The `fn1` function is called with `p` as an argument.\n4. Inside an infinite loop, a struct `H` variable `r` is declared.
