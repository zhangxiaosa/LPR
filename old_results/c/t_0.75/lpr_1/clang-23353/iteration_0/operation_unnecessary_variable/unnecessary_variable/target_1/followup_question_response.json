We track the assignments and modifications to `p1` within the `fn2` function:\n   - The for loop initializes `p3` to 6 and continues until `p3` is not equal to -7. `p1` is not used or modified here.\n   - Inside the loop, `p3` is decremented in each iteration. Again, `p1` is not used or modified here.\n   - The function call `fn1(p3, i)` uses `p3` and `i`.
