The program defines a global variable `g`.\n\n2. The `main` function begins.\n\n3. Inside the `main` function, the following variables are defined:\n   - `j` (integer) with an initial value of `0x24F96B7B`\n   - `k` (unsigned integer)\n\n4. An `if` statement checks the condition `j`. If `j` is non-zero, `--j` is executed, decrementing the value of `j` by 1.\n\n5. A new variable `m` is defined with the same value as `j`.\n\n6. A label `q` is defined.\n\n7. The variable `k` is right-shifted by 1 bit (`k >> 1L`).\n\n8. Another `if` statement checks the condition `g`. If `g` is non-zero, the variable `k` is left-shifted by the value of `m`.\n\n9.
