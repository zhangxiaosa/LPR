Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:\n\n1. The variable `g` is declared as an `int` at the global scope.\n\n2. In the `main` function:\n   - The variable `j` is declared and assigned the value `0x24F96B7BL`.\n   - The variable `k` is declared as an unsigned integer.\n   \n3. There is an `if` statement checking the value of `j`. Since `j` is non-zero (assuming it's not modified elsewhere in the program), the condition will always evaluate to true, and the statement `--j` will be executed.\n\n4. There is a label `q` used with the `goto` statement.\n\n5. The variable `k` is right-shifted by `1L` (1 bit shift).\n\n6. There is another `if` statement checking the value of `g`. Since `g` is declared but not assigned a value, its initial value is 0. Therefore, the condition will always evaluate to false, and the block inside the `if` statement will not be executed.\n\n7. The program ends.\n\nTo optimize out the variable `g`, we can remove all references to it since it's not used in the program.
