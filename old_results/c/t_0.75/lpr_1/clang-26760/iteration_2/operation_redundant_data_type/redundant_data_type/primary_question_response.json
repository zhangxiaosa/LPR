Another variable \"m\" is declared and initialized with the value of \"j\". The data type of \"m\" is \"int\".\n\n7. A label \"q\" is defined.\n\n8. The variable \"k\" is right-shifted by 1, where the shift value is of type \"long\" due to the suffix \"L\".\n\n9. Another \"if\" statement checks if \"g\" is non-zero.
