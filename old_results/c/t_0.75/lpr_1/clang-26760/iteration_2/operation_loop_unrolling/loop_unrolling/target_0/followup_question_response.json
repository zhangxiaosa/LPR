Each iteration of the loop performs the same operation, so we can replace the loop with a sequence of statements that perform the operation the desired number of times.\n\nHere's the step-by-step analysis and modification of the program:\n\n1. Initialize a variable `unroll_count` to the number of times we want to unroll the loop. In this case, we want to unroll it once.\n2.

The loop iterates until the condition `g` is true.\n2. Inside the loop, the statement `k = k >> 1L;` shifts the value of `k` one bit to the right.\n3.
