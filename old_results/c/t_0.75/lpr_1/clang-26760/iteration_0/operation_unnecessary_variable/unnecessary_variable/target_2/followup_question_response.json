Variable `n` is assigned the value of `g`, which is a global variable of type `a`.\n8. Variable `o` is assigned the value of `n`, which is uninitialized at this point.\n9. The label `q` is defined.\n10. The variable `k` is shifted right by the value of `l`.\n11. If `o` is non-zero, `k` is shifted left by the value of `m`, and the program jumps to the label `q`.\n12.

The variable `m` is assigned the value of `j`. Since `j` is not modified after the nested loops, we can replace all instances of `m` with the value of `j` after the nested loops.\n\n5. The variable `n` is assigned the value of `g`. If `g` is not modified, we can replace all instances of `n` with `g`.\n\n6. The variable `o` is assigned the value of `n`. Since `n` is replaced with `g`, we can replace all instances of `o` with `g`.\n\n7. The value of `k` is shifted right by `l` (which is 1) and then left by `m` (which is `j`). If `o` is true, the `goto` statement redirects execution to the label `q`. Otherwise, the program terminates.\n\n8.
