In this case, the loop goes from `k = 0` to `k >= -27` with a decrement of 6 (`k = k - 6`). Let's unroll the loop by expanding it into individual iterations:\n\n1. Iteration 1: `k = 0`\n2. Iteration 2: `k = -6`\n3. Iteration 3: `k = -12`\n4. Iteration 4: `k = -18`\n5.

Loop unrolling is a technique where multiple loop iterations are combined into a single iteration to reduce the loop overhead and improve performance.\n\nIn this case, the loop has a fixed number of iterations (`k >= -27`), and the loop variable `k` is decremented by 6 in each iteration.
