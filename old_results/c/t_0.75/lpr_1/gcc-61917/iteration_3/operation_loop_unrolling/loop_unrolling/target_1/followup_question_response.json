We have a loop with the condition `l` that increments `l` in every iteration. We'll unroll this loop, duplicating the loop body multiple times.\n\n2. The loop body initializes `k` to 0 and then enters an inner loop that iterates as long as `k` is greater than or equal to -27. Within the inner loop, the statement `p1 = o - p1` is executed.\n\n3. Since the value of `k` does not change within the inner loop, we can calculate the number of iterations and unroll the loop accordingly. In this case, `k` starts at 0, and the loop decrements `k` by 6 in each iteration until `k` reaches -27. The number of iterations can be calculated as `(0 - (-27)) / 6 + 1 = 5`, so we'll unroll the loop five times.\n\n4. After unrolling the inner loop, we'll update the loop body accordingly. Instead of a loop, we'll have five iterations of the loop body with different values of `k`.\n\n5.

The loop condition is `l`, which means the loop will iterate as long as `l` is non-zero.\n2. The loop variable `l` is incremented by 1 in each iteration (`l++`).\n3.
