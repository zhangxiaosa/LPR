Since the function `fn1` returns its input (`p2`), we can replace the function call `fn1(5)` with the constant `5` directly in the program.\n\n2. The function `main` creates an instance of the structure `m` named `ad` and initializes its member `n` with the value `1957`.\n\n3. The variable `ae` is assigned the value of `ad.o`, which is the result of the previous function call `fn1(5)`.
