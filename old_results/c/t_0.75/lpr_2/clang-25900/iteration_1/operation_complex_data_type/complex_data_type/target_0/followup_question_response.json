The function simply returns the value of `p2`.\n\n2. The program declares the following variables:\n   - `int r`: This variable is declared but not initialized.\n   - `static int s = -5L`: This is a static variable of type `int` initialized with the value -5L.\n   - `unsigned t`: This is an unsigned variable declared but not initialized.\n   - `struct m ad`: This is a structure variable of type `struct m` initialized with the value `{1957}`.\n\n3.
