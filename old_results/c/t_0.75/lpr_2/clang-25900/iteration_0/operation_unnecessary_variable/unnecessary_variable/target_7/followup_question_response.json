The target variable to be optimized is `v`. We need to identify all the occurrences of `v` in the program and analyze if its value can be propagated or eliminated.\n\n2. The program has the following occurrences of `v`:\n\n   - In the line `ad.o = fn1(v, 5);`, `v` is passed as an argument to the function `fn1()`. Since `fn1()` returns `p2` directly, we can propagate the value of `v` to `p2` in the function call. The line can be rewritten as `ad.o = fn1(5, 5);`, eliminating the use of `v`.\n\n   - In the line `r = t % (~s / ae);`, `v` is not directly used. Therefore, we can eliminate the computation of `t % (~s / ae)` as it doesn't affect the output of the program.\n\n   - In the line `ad.o;`, `v` is not used or assigned to any variable. We can safely remove this line of code.\n\n3.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:\n\n1. Constant propagation:\n   - The function `fn1` returns the value of `p2`, which is an `int`. Since `v` is an `unsigned` variable, its value is not influenced by the function call. Therefore, we can replace `fn1(v, 5)` with just `5`.\n   - The static variable `s` has a constant value of -5. So, we can replace `~s` with `4` (bitwise complement of -5).\n   - The variable `ae` is assigned the value of `ad.o`, which is a `bool` (int with a width of 1 bit). We can replace `ae` with `ad.o`.\n\n2. Copy propagation:\n   - The variable `ae` is assigned the value of `ad.o`.
