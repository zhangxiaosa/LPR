Here is the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. The program includes the standard input/output library (`stdio.h`), which provides functions for input and output operations.\n\n2. Several typedef statements are used to define new names for existing data types: `a` is a `short`, `b` is an `int`, `c` is a `long`, `d`, `e`, `f`, and `g` are all `unsigned`.\n\n3. A structure named `h` is defined, which has three members: `i` (a signed integer), `j` (a `c` type, which is a `long`), and `k` (an `unsigned`).\n\n4. A global variable `l` is declared with the data type `d`, which is `unsigned`.\n\n5. A static function `fn1` is defined, which takes five parameters: `p1` (an `f` type, which is `unsigned`), `p2` (an `a` type, which is `short`), `p3` (a `g` type, which is `unsigned`), `p4` (a `d` type, which is `unsigned`), and `p5` (a structure of type `h`).\n\n6. Inside the `fn1` function, the member `k` of the `p5` structure is accessed but not used.\n\n7. The `fn2` function is defined, which takes one parameter `p1` of type `e` (which is `unsigned`).\n\n8. Inside the `fn2` function, a local variable `p` is declared with the structure type `h` and a local variable `q` is declared with the data type `b`, which is `int`.\n\n9. The `fn1` function is called with arguments `q`, `l`, `p1`, `3`, and `p`.\n\n10. Inside an infinite `for` loop in the `fn2` function, a local variable `r` is declared with the structure type `h`, and then the variables `p` and `r` are assigned the value of `p`.\n\n11. The `main` function is defined, which has a return type of `int`.\n\nTo extract the variable `p2` with a primary data type, we can see that it is passed as a parameter to the `fn1` function.
