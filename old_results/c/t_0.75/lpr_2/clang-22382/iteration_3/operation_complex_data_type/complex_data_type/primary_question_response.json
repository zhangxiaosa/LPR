The program defines a structure named `h` with three members: `i` (int), `j` (long), and `k` (int).\n2. The program declares a static function `fn1` that takes an unsigned integer `p1` and a structure `p5` of type `h` as parameters. The function uses the member `k` of `p5`, but it doesn't assign or return any complex data type variables.\n3. The program declares another function `fn2` that takes an unspecified parameter `p1`. Inside `fn2`, a structure variable `p` of type `h` is declared. The function calls `fn1` with arguments 0 and `p`. Inside an infinite loop, a structure variable `r` of type `h` is declared, and `p` and `r` are assigned the value of `p` using the `=` operator.\n4.
