Therefore, there are no intermediate or unused variables in this function.\n\n2. `fn2()`:\n   - The function `fn2()` declares two variables:\n     - `c`: This variable is assigned the value of `fn1`. It is a local variable and is considered an intermediate variable.\n     - `f`: This is a vector variable of type `d` and is initialized with the value of `c`. It is also a local variable and will be considered an intermediate variable.\n   - The function `fn2()` returns the variable `f`.\n\n3. `main()`:\n   - The function `main()` is empty and does not declare any variables.
