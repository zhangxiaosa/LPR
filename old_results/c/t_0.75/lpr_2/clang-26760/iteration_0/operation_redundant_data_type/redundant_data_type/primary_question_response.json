Variables are declared using these data types:\n   - f: d\n   - g: a\n\n3. A function named `fn1` is defined, which returns a value of type b (short).

Variables `l`, `m`, `n`, `o`, and `p` are assigned values based on other variables.\n\n6. A label `q` is defined.\n\n7. The variable `k` is right-shifted by the value of `l`.\n\n8. The variable `i` is assigned the value of `p`.\n\n9. An if-statement checks if `i` is non-zero. If true, `k` is left-shifted by the value of `m`, and the program jumps to the label `q`.\n\n10.
