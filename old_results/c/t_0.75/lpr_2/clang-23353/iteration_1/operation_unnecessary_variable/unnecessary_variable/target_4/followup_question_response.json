However, the loop only has one iteration because the initial value of `p3` is set to 6 and it is decremented by 7 in each iteration until it becomes less than -7. Therefore, we can optimize `p3` by replacing it with its final value after the loop.\n4. After the loop, the statement `j ^= fn1(p3 - 2, i) && 1L;` and `j ^= fn1(p3 - 3, i) && 1L;` are executed.
