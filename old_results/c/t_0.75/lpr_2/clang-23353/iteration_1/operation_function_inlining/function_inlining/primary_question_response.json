It multiplies `p1` and `p2` and returns the result as a `char`.\n\n2. Next, there is a struct declaration: `struct g { signed h; };`.

This function is named `fn2` and takes three parameters: an `unsigned` `p1`, an `int` pointer `p2`, and a `char` `p3`. Inside the function, there is a loop that XORs `j.h` with the result of calling `fn1(p3, i)` bitwise ANDed with `1L`.
