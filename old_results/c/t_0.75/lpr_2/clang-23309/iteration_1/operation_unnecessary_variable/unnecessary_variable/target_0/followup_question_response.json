Within the `if` block, the variable `p2` is assigned the value of `ac || (an = w)`. Since `an` has already been optimized to `250UL`, the assignment becomes `p2 = ac || (250UL = w)`. This assignment can be further simplified to `p2 = ac || (250UL = 3)` since `w` is assigned the constant value `3` in the `for` loop.\n5. The expression `(ao - (fn6(am, an) - 0xECL)) - ac & 1UL` within the nested `if` condition involves the optimized value of `an` (`250UL`). The expression can be simplified to `(ao - (fn6(am, 250UL) - 0xECL)) - ac & 1UL`.\n6. The assignment `v = 1UL` within the nested `if` block can be optimized to `v = 1`.\n7. After the loop, the value of `v` is assigned to `p` (`p = v`). Since `v` is always `1` due to the optimized assignment, `p` can be optimized to `1`.\n8.
