The program starts with the definition of a structure `c` with two `int` members `d` and `e`.\n2. Then, an instance of the structure `f` is declared.\n3. Next, a function `fn1` is defined with a return type of `char`.\n4. Inside the function `fn1`, there is a declaration of an `int` variable `h` and its initialization to the value `6L`.\n5. Following that, there is an `if` statement that checks the value of `f.e`. If the value is non-zero, the program jumps to the label `i`.\n6. In both branches of the `if` statement, the function `fn1` is called recursively.\n7. After the `if` statement, a `char` variable `j` is declared.\n8.
