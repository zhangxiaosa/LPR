The program starts with two typedef statements:\n   - typedef int a;\n   - typedef char b;\n   These define the data types 'a' and 'b' respectively.\n\n2. Next, there is a struct definition:\n   - struct c {\n     a d;\n     a e;\n   };\n   This struct defines a data type named 'c', which contains two variables of type 'a' named 'd' and 'e'.\n\n3. After the struct definition, there is an instance of struct 'c':\n   - struct c f;\n   This creates an instance named 'f' of the struct 'c'.\n\n4.

The variable 'h' is defined as 'a' (int) and assigned the value 6L.\n\n6. There is an if statement that checks the value of 'f.e'. Since 'f' is an instance of struct 'c' and 'e' is of type 'a' (int), this is not a redundant data type.\n\n7. Inside the if block, the function 'fn1' is recursively called.\n\n8.
