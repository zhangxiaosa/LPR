The program defines two integer variables `f_d` and `f_e`.\n2. It defines a function `fn1` that returns a `char` data type.\n3. Inside the function `fn1`, there is an `if` statement that checks the value of `f_e`.\n4. If the condition `f_e` is true, it jumps to the label `i`.\n5. After the `if` statement, there is a recursive call to the function `fn1`.\n6. The function `fn1` returns the hexadecimal value `0xEEACFBBF`.\n7. The label `i` is defined.\n8. Inside the label `i`, the value of `f_d` is assigned `6L`.\n9. After the assignment, there is a recursive call to the function `fn1`.\n10. The function `fn1` returns the hexadecimal value `0xEEACFBBF`.\n11.
