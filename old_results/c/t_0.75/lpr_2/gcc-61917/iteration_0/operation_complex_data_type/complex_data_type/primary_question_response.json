The program starts by declaring three variables: `int k;`, `unsigned l;`, and `volatile unsigned m[5][8];`. \n   - `k` is of type `int`, which is a primary data type.\n   - `l` is of type `unsigned`, which is a primary data type.\n   - `m` is a 2-dimensional array of type `volatile unsigned`, which is a complex data type.\n\n2.
