The given program has a global variable `int k`, an unsigned global variable `unsigned l`, and a volatile unsigned 2D array `m` with dimensions 5x8.\n2. There is a function `unsigned fn3(p1)` that takes an argument `p1` and returns an unsigned value.\n3. Inside the `fn3` function, there is a local signed variable `signed o`.\n4.
