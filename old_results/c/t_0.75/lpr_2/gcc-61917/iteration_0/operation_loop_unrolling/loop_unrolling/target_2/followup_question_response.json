Modify the loop increment statement `k = k - 6` to `k = k - 18` to skip three iterations at a time.\n4. Unroll the loop three times, performing the loop body three times in each iteration.\n5. Replace the loop body statement `p1 = o - p1;` with the unrolled loop body, repeating it three times.\n6. Update the loop termination condition to `(k >= -30)` to reflect the modified loop bound.\n7.
