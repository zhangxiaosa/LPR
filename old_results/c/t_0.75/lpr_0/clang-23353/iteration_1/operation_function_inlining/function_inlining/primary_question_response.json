Here is the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. The first function is named `fn1` and returns a `char` value. It takes two parameters `p1` and `p2`, both of type `char`. The function body simply multiplies `p1` and `p2` and returns the result.\n\n2. The second function is named `fn2` and returns an `int` pointer (`int*`). It takes three parameters: `p1` of type `unsigned`, `p2` of type `int*`, and `p3` of type `char`. Inside the function, there is a `for` loop that initializes `p3` to 6 and continues as long as `p3` is not equal to -7. In each iteration, it performs a bitwise XOR operation between `j_h` and the result of calling `fn1` with `p3` and `i` as arguments, bitwise ANDs the result with `1L`, and assigns it back to `j_h`. Finally, the function returns `p2`.\n\n3. The `main` function has a return type of `int` and returns 0.\n\nBased on this analysis, the identified functions are `fn1` and `fn2`.
