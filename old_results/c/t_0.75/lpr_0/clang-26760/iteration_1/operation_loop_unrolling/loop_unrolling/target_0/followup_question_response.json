Loop unrolling is a technique where we duplicate the loop body multiple times, reducing the number of iterations required.

Determine the number of times to unroll the loop. Let's assume we want to unroll the loop `for (; j; --j)` four times.\n\n2. Duplicate the loop body four times. Each duplicated loop iteration will decrement `j` by one.\n\n3. Modify the condition of the outer loop (`while (1)`) to terminate when `j` becomes zero.\n\n4.

Since the loop condition is `j`, we can unroll the loop by the initial value of `j` times.\n\nHere's the step-by-step analysis of the program optimization:\n\n1. Initialize the variables:\n   - unsigned `g` is declared but not initialized.\n   - signed `i` is declared but not initialized.\n   - int `j` is initialized with the value `0x24F96B7B`.\n   - unsigned `k` is declared but not initialized.\n   - unsigned `f` is declared but not initialized.\n\n2. The first `for` loop is an infinite loop since the condition `f` is not updated inside the loop. Hence, the loop will execute repeatedly until interrupted.\n\n3. Inside the infinite loop, the following actions are performed:\n   - Bitwise right shift operation `k = k >> 1` is performed.\n   - The value of `g` is assigned to `i`.\n   - If `i` is non-zero, a bitwise left shift operation `k = k << j` is performed, and the loop continues.\n   - If `i` is zero, the loop breaks.\n\n4.
