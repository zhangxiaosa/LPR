The variable `k` is used in the loop condition and is modified within the loop.\n4. The variable `l` is used in the outer loop condition and is incremented within the loop.\n5. The variable `p1` is modified within the loop.\n6. The variable `m25` is used in the `p1 || m25` expression.\n7. The `fn3` function does not return anything.\n8.
