The original program:\n```c\nint k;\nunsigned l;\nvolatile unsigned m25;\nunsigned fn3(p1) {\n  int o;\n  for (;;) {\n    // Unrolled iteration 1\n    for (; l >= 3; l -= 3) {\n      // Unrolled iteration 1\n      for (k = 0; k >= -27; k = k - 6)\n        p1 = o - p1;\n\n      // Unrolled iteration 2\n      for (k = 0; k >= -27; k = k - 6)\n        p1 = o - p1;\n\n      // Unrolled iteration 3\n      for (k = 0; k >= -27; k = k - 6)\n        p1 = o - p1;\n    }\n\n    // Handle remaining iterations that do not fit into unrolling\n    for (; l; l++)\n      for (k = 0; k >= -27; k = k - 6)\n        p1 = o - p1;\n\n    p1 || m25;\n  }\n}\n\nint main() {}\n```\n\n2. We can see that the target loop appears three times within the unrolled iteration loop. Let's simplify and modify the program by removing the outer loop since it is an infinite loop and doesn't affect the optimization process.\n\n3. Modified program:\n```c\nint k;\nunsigned l;\nvolatile unsigned m25;\nunsigned fn3(p1) {\n  int o;\n  // Unrolled iteration 1\n  for (; l >= 3; l -= 3) {\n    // Unrolled iteration 1\n    for (k = 0; k >= -27; k = k - 6)\n      p1 = o - p1;\n\n    // Unrolled iteration 2\n    for (k = 0; k >= -27; k = k - 6)\n      p1 = o - p1;\n\n    // Unrolled iteration 3\n    for (k = 0; k >= -27; k = k - 6)\n      p1 = o - p1;\n  }\n\n  // Handle remaining iterations that do not fit into unrolling\n  for (; l; l++)\n    for (k = 0; k >= -27; k = k - 6)\n      p1 = o - p1;\n\n  p1 || m25;\n}\n\nint main() {}\n```\n\n4. The target loop is already unrolled three times within the unrolled iteration loop. Since the loop has a constant number of iterations, we don't need to further optimize it.\n\n5.
