The variable `p2` is used in the condition `(an = w) == 0x294A85636008822DLL`.\n4. If the condition is true, the variable `p3` is updated based on the logical OR operation with `p2`.\n5. The variable `p2` is used in the expression `1 - an`.\n6. The expression `1 - an` is passed as an argument to the function `fn4`.\n7. The result of the function `fn4` is subtracted from the variable `ao`.\n8. The variable `p3` is used in the same expression as above.\n9. The result of the subtraction is then bitwise ANDed with `1`.\n10. If the bitwise AND operation is nonzero, the variable `v` is assigned the value `1`.\n\nTo optimize the variable `p2` by constant propagation or copy propagation, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Replace the usage of `p2` in the condition `(an = w) == 0x294A85636008822DLL` with its constant value.\n2. Replace the usage of `p2` in the expression `1 - an` with its constant value.\n3.
