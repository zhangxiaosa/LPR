In the `fn11` function, the value of `p2` is assigned to `p3`, and `an` is assigned the value of 250.\n\n4.

Inside the if block, `p3` is assigned the value of `p2 || (an = 0)`. This means `p3` will always be assigned the value of `p2` since the logical OR (`||`) operator short-circuits if the left operand is true.\n\n6. The variable `ao` is assigned the value of `0xBCD1`.\n\n7. The condition `if (ao - fn4(1 - an, 0xEC) - p3 & 1)` will be evaluated.\n\n8.
