Next, there is a struct definition:\n   ```c\n   struct h {\n     signed i;\n     c j;\n     unsigned k;\n   };\n   ```\n   This struct definition introduces a complex data type named `struct h` with three members: `signed i`, `c j`, and `unsigned k`.\n\n3. After the struct definition, there is a variable declaration:\n   ```c\n   d l;\n   ```\n   The variable `l` is of type `d`, which is a typedef for `unsigned`. Therefore, `l` is a variable with a complex data type.\n\n4.
