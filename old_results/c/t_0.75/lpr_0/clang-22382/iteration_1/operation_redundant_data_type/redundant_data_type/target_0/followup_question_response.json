The target data type to be optimized is `a`, which is defined as `typedef short a;`.\n\n2. To eliminate the typedef `a`, we need to find every instance of `a` in the program and replace it with its associated original data type, `short`.\n\n3. Here are the replacements to be made:\n\n  - Replace `a` with `short` in the function signature `static struct h fn1(f, a, struct h);`.\n  - Replace `a` with `short` in the function definition `struct h fn1(f p1, a p2, struct h p5)`.\n  - Replace `a` with `short` in the function call `fn1(q, l, p)` inside the `fn2` function.\n  - Replace `a` with `short` in the function parameter `a p2` of the `fn1` function definition.\n\n4. After making the replacements, the optimized program will look like this:\n\n```c\ntypedef int b;\ntypedef long c;\ntypedef unsigned d;\ntypedef unsigned e;\ntypedef unsigned f;\nstruct h {\n  signed i;\n  c j;\n  unsigned k;\n};\nd l;\nstatic struct h fn1(f, short, struct h);\ne fn2(p1) {\n  struct h p;\n  b q;\n  fn1(q, l, p);\n  for (;;) {\n    struct h r;\n    p = r = p;\n  }\n}\nstruct h fn1(f p1, short p2, struct h p5) {\n  p5.k;\nw:\n  goto w;\n}\nint main() {}\n```\n\n5.
