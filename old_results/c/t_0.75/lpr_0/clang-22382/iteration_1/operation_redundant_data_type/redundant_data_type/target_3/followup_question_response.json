Therefore, there are no instances of it to replace with its associated original data type.\n3. The program includes a struct definition and two function definitions: `fn2` and `fn1`.\n4. The struct definition defines a struct type named \"h\" with three members: \"i\" (signed int), \"j\" (long), and \"k\" (unsigned int).\n5. The struct type \"h\" is used as a parameter type and as a return type in the function declarations of `fn1` and `fn2`.\n6. The variable \"l\" of type unsigned int is declared outside any function.\n7. The function `fn2` declares two local variables: \"p\" of type struct h and \"q\" of type int.\n8. The function `fn2` calls the function `fn1` with arguments \"q\", \"l\", and \"p\".\n9. The function `fn2` contains an infinite loop where a local variable \"r\" of type struct h is declared, and then \"p\" is assigned the value of \"r\", which is assigned the value of \"p\".\n10.
