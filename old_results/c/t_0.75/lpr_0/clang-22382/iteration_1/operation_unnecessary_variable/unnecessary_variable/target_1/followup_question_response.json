Therefore, we can safely remove it from the struct definition.\n\n2. In the `fn1` function, the variable `j` is not used or assigned to any value. It is only accessed using `p5.j`. Since `p5` is a parameter and its value is not modified, we can consider `p5.j` as unused. Therefore, we can optimize out the assignment `p5.k;`.\n\n3. In the `fn2` function, the `l` variable is passed as an argument to `fn1`. Since `fn1` doesn't use the `l` variable, we can remove the argument `l` from the function call.\n\n4.
