Initialize variable `l` of type `struct c` with specific values:\n   ```c\n   struct c l = {24, 6738, 165};\n   ```\n\n5. Declare and initialize variable `m` of type `int` with the value of `j.e`:\n   ```c\n   int m = j.e;\n   ```\n\n6. Assign the value of `m` to `l.d`:\n   ```c\n   l.d = m;\n   ```\n\n7.
