We can replace `l.d` with its assigned value `j.e` using copy propagation.\n\n3. After copy propagation, the assignment becomes `p = j.e | -(l.f && j.e) - n`.\n\n4. The expression `l.f && j.e` represents a logical AND operation. If `l.f` is non-zero, the expression evaluates to `j.e`; otherwise, it evaluates to zero. We can replace `(l.f && j.e)` with `j.e * l.f` using constant propagation.\n\n5. After constant propagation, the assignment becomes `p = j.e | -(j.e * l.f) - n`.\n\n6. The expression `j.e * l.f` represents a multiplication. If either `j.e` or `l.f` is zero, the expression evaluates to zero; otherwise, it evaluates to a non-zero value. We can replace `(j.e * l.f)` with `j.e * (l.f != 0)` using constant propagation.\n\n7. After constant propagation, the assignment becomes `p = j.e | -(j.e * (l.f != 0)) - n`.\n\n8. The expression `l.f != 0` represents a comparison with zero. If `l.f` is non-zero, the expression evaluates to 1; otherwise, it evaluates to 0.

The expression `l.d | -(l.f && l.d)` performs a bitwise OR operation between `l.d` and the negation of `(l.f && l.d)`.\n3. The expression `l.f && l.d` checks if both `l.f` and `l.d` are non-zero.\n4. If `l.f` is non-zero, and `l.d` is non-zero, the result of `(l.f && l.d)` is 1; otherwise, it is 0.\n5. The negation of 1 is -1, and the negation of 0 is 0.\n6. Therefore, the expression `-(l.f && l.d)` evaluates to -1 if both `l.f` and `l.d` are non-zero; otherwise, it evaluates to 0.\n7. The bitwise OR operation `l.d | -(l.f && l.d)` combines the bits of `l.d` and the negation of `(l.f && l.d)`.\n8.
