We start with the function `fn1()`. Inside the function, we have an `if` statement that checks the value of the variable `f_e`. Since `f_e` is not initialized or modified before this `if` statement, we assume its value is unknown. However, if `f_e` evaluates to true, we have a `goto` statement that jumps to the label `i`.\n\n2. At the label `i`, we assign the value `6L` to the variable `f_d`. It is unclear how `f_d` is used outside of this function, so we cannot optimize it out at this point.\n\n3. After the assignment to `f_d`, we call `fn1()` recursively. This recursive call does not affect the value of `j` or any other variables.\n\n4. Back in the original `fn1()` function, after the recursive call, we have an assignment statement `j = 0xEEACFBBFL;`. This assigns a constant value to `j`. Since `j` is not used or returned, we can optimize it out.\n\n5. Finally, we have a `return` statement that returns the value of `j`.
