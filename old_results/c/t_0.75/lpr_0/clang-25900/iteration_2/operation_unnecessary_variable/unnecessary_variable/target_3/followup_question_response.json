We cannot optimize `r` further until the value of `t` is known.\n3. The expression `~s / ae` involves bitwise negation of `s` and division by `ae`.\n4. `s` is a static variable with a known value of -5, so `~s` is 4 (complement of -5 in two's complement representation).\n5. `ae` is assigned the value of `ad.o`, which is the return value of `fn1(5)`.\n6. `fn1(p2)` simply returns the value of `p2`, so `fn1(5)` returns 5.\n7. Therefore, `ae` is assigned the value 5.\n8. The expression `4 / 5` evaluates to 0 because both operands are integers, and integer division discards the fractional part.\n9. Finally, `r` is assigned the value of `t % 0`. Since the value of `t` is unknown, we cannot optimize this expression any further.\n\nThe provided program does not have any unused variables to optimize out.
