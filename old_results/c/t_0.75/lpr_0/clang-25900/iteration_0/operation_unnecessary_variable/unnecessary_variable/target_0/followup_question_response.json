The struct `m` is defined with two signed bit fields `n` and `o`.\n4. Global variables `r`, `s`, `t`, `u`, and `v` are declared.\n5. The `main` function begins by declaring a struct variable `ad` and initializing its `n` field with the value `1957`.\n6.

The variable `ae` is assigned the value of `ad.o`.\n10. The `o` field of `ad` is assigned the value of `u`.\n11.
