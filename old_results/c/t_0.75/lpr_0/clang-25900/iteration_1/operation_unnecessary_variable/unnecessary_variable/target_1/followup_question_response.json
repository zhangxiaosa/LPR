Variable Declarations:\n   - `struct m ad = {1957}`: Declares a structure variable `ad` of type `struct m` and initializes the `n` field with the value `1957`.\n   - `signed ae`: Declares a signed integer variable `ae` without initialization.\n\n2. Function Call:\n   - `ad.o = fn1(5)`: Calls the function `fn1` and assigns its return value (`5`) to the `o` field of the `ad` structure.\n\n3. Variable Assignment:\n   - `ae = ad.o`: Assigns the value of the `o` field of the `ad` structure to the variable `ae`.\n\n4. Arithmetic Operation and Assignment:\n   - `r = t % (~s / ae)`: Performs the following operations:\n     - `~s`: Computes the bitwise complement of the variable `s` (-5L), resulting in `4`.\n     - `~s / ae`: Divides `4` by the value of `ae`.\n     - `t % (~s / ae)`: Computes the modulus of the variable `t` by the result of the division.\n     - Assigns the result to the variable `r`.\n\n5.
