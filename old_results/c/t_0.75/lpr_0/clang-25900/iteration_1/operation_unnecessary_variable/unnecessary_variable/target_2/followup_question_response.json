Therefore, `ad.o` can be replaced with `5` in the expression.\n\n7. The expression `t % (~s / ae)` can be simplified as follows:\n   - `~s` is the bitwise complement of `-5`, which is `4`.\n   - `4 / ae` is the division of `4` by `5`, which results in `0` (integer division).\n   - `t % 0` is an undefined operation because division by zero is not allowed.
