The target variable to be optimized is `t`.\n2. Since the value of `t` is computed using various operations, we need to propagate constant values and copy expressions to optimize it.\n3. The expression `an = 2` is always evaluated, regardless of the condition. We can replace `an = 2` with `2` to optimize it.\n4. The expression `0xBCD1LL - fn4(1 - an) - t` is evaluated, and its result is used in the condition `& 1UL`. We can replace `fn4(1 - an)` with `fn4(-1)` and propagate the constant values to optimize it.\n5. After propagating the constant values and copy expressions, we can simplify the expression for `t` as follows:\n   - `t = ac || 2 == 0x294A85636008822LL` since `an = 2` is replaced.\n   - `t = ac || 2 == 0x294A85636008822LL` since `fn4(-1)` is replaced with `fn4(-1) = -1`.\n   - `t = 1 || 2 == 0x294A85636008822LL` since `ac` is initialized to `1`.\n   - `t = 1` since `1 || 2 == 0x294A85636008822LL` is `true`.\n6.

The `if` condition `if (an = 250)` is always true because it is an assignment (`=`) instead of a comparison (`==`).\n3. Inside the `if` block, the expression `an = 2` is evaluated, which assigns the value 2 to the variable `an`.\n4. The expression `ac || (an = 2) == 0x294A85636008822LL` is evaluated using the logical OR (`||`) operator. Since `ac` is non-zero (1), the expression evaluates to true (1).\n5. The result of the logical OR operation is assigned to the variable `t`.\n6. The expression `fn4(1 - an)` is evaluated, where `fn4()` returns the value of its argument. In this case, `fn4(1 - an)` is equivalent to `fn4(-1)`, which returns -1.\n7. The expression `0xBCD1LL - fn4(1 - an) - t & 1UL` is evaluated. The subtraction `- fn4(1 - an)` is equivalent to subtracting -1, so the expression becomes `0xBCD1LL + 1 - t & 1UL`.\n8. The bitwise AND (`&`) operation is applied to the result of the subtraction and `1UL`. The result is either 0 or 1.\n9. If the result of the bitwise AND operation is non-zero (1), the variable `v` is assigned the value 1.\n10.

Assignment to `t`:\n- `t = ac || (an = 2) == 0x294A85636008822LL;` - Evaluate the logical OR expression `ac || (an = 2) == 0x294A85636008822LL` and assign the result to `t`. The expression `an = 2` assigns the value `2` to `an` and evaluates to `2`, which is then compared to `0x294A85636008822LL` (a large hexadecimal number). The result of the comparison is `false` (0) because `2` is not equal to the large number. Finally, the logical OR operation with `ac` (which is `1`) results in `true` (1), and the value `1` is assigned to `t`.\n\n5. Check condition:\n- `if (0xBCD1LL - fn4(1 - an) - t & 1UL)` - Evaluate the expression `0xBCD1LL - fn4(1 - an) - t & 1UL`. The function call `fn4(1 - an)` is equivalent to `fn4(-1)` because `an` is `2`. The function `fn4` returns its parameter, so `fn4(-1)` returns `-1`. The expression `0xBCD1LL - (-1) - t` simplifies to `0xBCD2LL - t`. Finally, the bitwise AND operation with `1UL` (unsigned long) is performed.\n\n6. Assignment to `v`:\n- `v = 1;` - Assign the value `1` to the variable `v` only if the condition in the previous step was true. Otherwise, `v` remains unchanged.\n\n7.

Since `ac` is a constant with the value 1, the expression `ac || (an = 2) == 0x294A85636008822LL` will always evaluate to `1` (true). Therefore, the assignment `(an = 2)` will never occur.\n3. The expression `0xBCD1LL - fn4(1 - an) - t & 1UL` is then evaluated. Since `fn4(1 - an)` is a function call that returns the value of its argument, and `t` is always `1`, the expression simplifies to `0xBCD1LL - (1 - an) - 1 & 1UL`.\n4. Since `an` is assigned the value `250` in the preceding `if` statement, the expression further simplifies to `0xBCD1LL - (1 - 250) - 1 & 1UL`.\n5. The expression `(1 - 250)` evaluates to `-249`, so the simplified expression becomes `0xBCD1LL - (-249) - 1 & 1UL`, which can be further simplified to `0xBCD1LL + 249 - 1 & 1UL`.\n6. The addition `0xBCD1LL + 249` evaluates to `0xBCFA`, so the expression becomes `0xBCFA - 1 & 1UL`, which simplifies to `0xBCF9 & 1UL`.\n7. The bitwise AND operation `0xBCF9 & 1UL` evaluates to `1`.\n8. Finally, the condition `if (1)` is evaluated, which is always true.
