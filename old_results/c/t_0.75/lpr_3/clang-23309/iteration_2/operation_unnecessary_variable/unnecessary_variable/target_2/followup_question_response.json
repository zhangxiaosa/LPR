Since `ac` is always 1 and `(an = w)` is the updated value of `w`, the condition `(an = w) == 0x294A85636008822DLL` is not relevant in determining the value of `t`.\n4. The function `fn4` is called with the argument `1L - an`. Since `an` is `250UL`, the argument passed to `fn4` is `1L - 250UL`, which simplifies to `-249L`.\n5.

The program has a function `fn4(p1)` that simply returns the value of `p1`. Since `p1` is not used anywhere else in the program, it can be optimized out.\n\n2. The variable `p` is declared as `unsigned` and assigned the value of `v`. Since `v` is only assigned a value of `1UL` inside the `if` condition, and the condition may or may not be true, the value of `p` is not guaranteed to be `1UL`. Therefore, the assignment can be optimized out.\n\n3. The variable `t` is assigned the result of the logical OR operation between `ac` and the comparison `(an = w) == 0x294A85636008822DLL`. Since the value of `ac` is always `1L`, the logical OR operation will always result in `1L`. Therefore, the assignment can be optimized to `t = 1L`.\n\n4. The variable `an` is initialized with the value `250UL`. The `if` condition `(an = 250UL)` is always true because it is an assignment operation that evaluates to the assigned value. Therefore, the condition can be optimized to `if (true)`.\n\n5. The expression `fn4(1L - an)` can be simplified by substituting the value of `an` from the previous step. Since `an` is always `250UL`, the expression becomes `fn4(1L - 250UL)` which simplifies to `fn4(-249L)`.\n\n6. The expression `0xBCD1L - fn4(-249L) - t & 1UL` can be simplified using constant propagation and copy propagation. The function `fn4(-249L)` is known to always return the input value, so it can be replaced with `-249L`. The variable `t` is assigned the constant value `1L`, so it can be replaced with `1L`. Therefore, the expression simplifies to `0xBCD1L - (-249L) - 1L & 1UL`.\n\n7.
