It defines a static function `fn1` that takes five parameters: `p1` (an unsigned integer), `p2` (a short integer), `p3` (an unsigned integer), `p4` (an unsigned integer), and `p5` (a structure of type `h`).\n5. Inside the `fn1` function, there is an unused statement `p5.k;`.\n6. It defines an unsigned integer function `fn2` that takes one parameter `p1` (an integer).\n7.
