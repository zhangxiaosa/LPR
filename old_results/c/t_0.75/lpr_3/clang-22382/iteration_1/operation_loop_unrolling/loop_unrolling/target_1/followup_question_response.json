Here's a step-by-step analysis of the optimization process:\n\n1. The target to be optimized is the label `w:` inside the `fn1` function.\n\n2. Since `w:` is the label for an infinite loop, we can replace the loop with repeated statements that have the same effect.\n\n3. Let's unroll the loop by replacing it with a series of repeated statements. In this case, we can use a `while` loop with a condition that always evaluates to true.\n\n4. The loop body consists of a simple `goto` statement that jumps back to the beginning of the loop. We can replace this with an empty statement since it doesn't have any effect.\n\n5. After unrolling the loop, the `fn1` function will become empty.\n\n6. The `fn2` function calls the `fn1` function with a constant `0` and a struct `p` as arguments. We can remove this call since `fn1` is empty.\n\n7. The `fn2` function contains an infinite loop (`for (;;)`). Since the loop body assigns `p` to `r`, and then assigns `r` back to `p`, we can simplify it to just assigning `p` to itself.\n\n8. After optimizing the loop, the `fn2` function will become an infinite loop that does nothing.\n\n9.
