The `goto w;` statement within `fn1` creates an infinite loop, which means that the statement `p5.k;` is never reached.\n\n4. In the `fn2` function, `fn1(0, p);` is called, passing `p` as an argument. However, the return value of `fn1` is not used or assigned to any variable, so the result of the function call can be optimized out.\n\n5. In the `for` loop within `fn2`, `p = r = p;` is executed repeatedly. This statement assigns the value of `p` to `r`, and then assigns the value of `r` back to `p`.
