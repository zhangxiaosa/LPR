Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program with optimizations:\n\n1. Since the variable `f` is not used in the `main()` function, it can be safely removed from the program.\n\n2. The `fn1()` function contains the usage of `f`. Let's analyze it further:\n\n   - In the `if (f)` condition, `f` is the controlling expression. If `f` is a constant, we can propagate its value and remove the condition.\n   \n   - The `goto` statement leads to the label `i`, where `f` is assigned the value 6. If `f` is a constant, we can propagate its value and remove the assignment.\n\n   - The `fn1()` function is called recursively after the `goto` statement. If `f` is a constant, we can propagate its value and remove the recursive call.\n\n3. After performing the optimizations, the `fn1()` function becomes:\n\n   ```c\n   char fn1() {\n     f = 6;\n     return 0;\n   }\n   ```\n\n4.
