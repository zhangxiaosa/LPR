Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. The function `fn2` has a parameter `p2` of type `struct m`. We need to decompose this struct into its individual members of primary data types.\n\n2. The struct `m` has two members:\n   - `int n : 18;` which is a signed integer of 18 bits.\n   - `int o : 1;` which is a signed integer of 1 bit.\n\n3. To decompose `p2`, we'll create two variables:\n   - `int ad_n` to represent the member `n` of `p2`.\n   - `int ad_o` to represent the member `o` of `p2`.\n\n4. The program also has other variables which are not directly related to `p2`:\n   - `unsigned p1` in the function `fn2`.\n   - `struct k p3` and `struct k p4` in the function `fn2`.\n   - `int p5` in the function `fn2`.\n   - `int ad` in the function `fn2`.\n   - `int ae` in the function `fn2`.\n   - `int af` in the function `fn2`.\n\n5.

After decomposing `p2`, we can modify the `fn1` function to return `ad_p2` instead of `p2`.\n\n7.
