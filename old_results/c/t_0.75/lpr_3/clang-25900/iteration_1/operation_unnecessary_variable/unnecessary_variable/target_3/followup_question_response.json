Analyze the program to identify the uses and definitions of the variable `p1`.\n2. Determine if `p1` is assigned a constant value or if it can be replaced with a copy of another variable with the same value.\n3. Replace all uses of `p1` with the constant value or the copy of the equivalent variable.\n4. Remove the unnecessary definition and initialization of `p1`.\n\nHere's the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. The variable `p1` is passed as a parameter to the function `fn2`.\n2. Inside `fn2`, `p1` is not used or assigned a value. Therefore, it can be optimized out.\n3. In the `main` function, `p1` is passed as an argument to `fn2`. Since `fn2` does not use `p1`, the argument can be removed.\n4. The variable `p1` is not used or assigned a value anywhere else in the program.

The variable `p1` is not used in the program. Therefore, we can safely remove it.\n\n2. The function `fn1` is called with `v` and `5` as arguments. Since the program does not provide the definition of `v`, we cannot perform constant propagation or copy propagation for this call.\n\n3. In the function `fn2`, the struct `ad` is initialized with `{1957}`. However, the variable `p1` is not used in the initialization or subsequent operations of `ad`. Therefore, we can safely remove it.\n\n4. The variable `ae` is assigned the value of `ad.o`. Since `ad.o` is not modified after this assignment, we can replace all occurrences of `ae` with `ad.o`.\n\n5. The variable `ad.o` is assigned the value of `u`. Since `u` is not modified after this assignment, we can replace all occurrences of `ad.o` with `u`.\n\n6. The variable `r` is assigned the result of the expression `t % (~s / ae)`. Since `ae` is replaced with `ad.o` (which is replaced with `u`), and `u` is not modified after the assignment, we can replace all occurrences of `ae` and `ad.o` in the expression with `u`.\n\n7. The statement `ad.o;` has no effect and can be safely removed.\n\n8. In the `main` function, the variable `p` is passed as an argument to `fn2`.
