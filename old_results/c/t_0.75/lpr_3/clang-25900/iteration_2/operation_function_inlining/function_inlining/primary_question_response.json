The program defines a function named `fn1` with two parameters (`p1` of type `unsigned` and `p2` of type `int`). It returns an `unsigned` value. The function body is `return p2;`.\n\n2. The program defines a structure named `m` with two members (`n` of type `int` with a width of 18 bits, and `o` of type `int` with a width of 1 bit).\n\n3. The program declares several global variables: `q_l` of type `unsigned`, `r` of type `int`, `t` of type `unsigned`, `u` of type `int`, and `v` of type `unsigned`.\n\n4. The program defines a function named `fn2` with a single parameter (`p3_l` of unspecified type). It returns an `int` value. The function body is as follows:\n   - It declares a local variable named `ad` of type `struct m` and initializes it with the value `{1957}`.\n   - It assigns the result of calling the function `fn1` with arguments `v` and `5` to the member `o` of `ad`.\n   - It declares a local variable named `ae` of type `int`.\n   - It assigns the value of `ad.o` to `ae`.\n   - It assigns the value of `u` to `ad.o`.\n   - It assigns the result of the expression `t % (5 / ae)` to the global variable `r`.\n   - It has a statement with just the expression `ad.o`, which doesn't have any effect.\n\n5. The program defines the `main` function, which has no parameters and returns an `int` value.

The function body simply returns the value of \"p2\".\n\n2. After the \"fn1\" function, there is a declaration of a structure named \"m\". It contains two members: an integer \"n\" with a bit field size of 18, and an integer \"o\" with a bit field size of 1.\n\n3. Following the structure declaration, there are several global variable declarations:\n   - \"q_l\" of type unsigned\n   - \"r\" of type int\n   - \"t\" of type unsigned\n   - \"u\" of type int\n   - \"v\" of type unsigned\n\n4. Next, there is a definition of a function named \"fn2\". It takes a single parameter named \"p3_l\" without specifying its type (assumed to be int). The return type of this function is int. The function body is as follows:\n   - It declares a local variable named \"ad\" of type \"struct m\" and initializes its member \"n\" with the value 1957.\n   - It assigns the result of calling the \"fn1\" function with arguments \"v\" and 5 to the member \"o\" of the \"ad\" variable.\n   - It declares a local variable named \"ae\" of type int.\n   - It assigns the value of \"ad.o\" to the \"ae\" variable.\n   - It assigns the value of \"u\" to the member \"o\" of the \"ad\" variable.\n   - It calculates the value of \"r\" by performing the modulo operation of \"t\" with the result of dividing 5 by \"ae\".\n   - It has an expression statement with the value of \"ad.o\", which doesn't have any effect.\n\n5. Finally, there is the main function declaration named \"main\". It takes no parameters and returns an int. The function body consists of a single statement, which is a function call to \"fn2\" with the argument \"q_l\".\n\nIdentified functions (other than the main function):\n- fn1\n- fn2\n\nJSON representation of the identified functions:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"target_list\": [\"fn1\", \"fn2\"]\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that the JSON representation provided above is in Markdown syntax.
