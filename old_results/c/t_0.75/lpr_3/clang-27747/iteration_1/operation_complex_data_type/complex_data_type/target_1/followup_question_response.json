It declares two variables of type `struct c` named `i` and `j`.\n4. The `main()` function begins.\n5. It declares a local variable `l` of type `struct c` and initializes it with the values `{24, 6738, 165}`.\n6. It assigns the value of `j.e` to `l.d`.\n7. It declares an integer variable `n` and assigns the result of the logical AND (`&&`) operation between `j.h` and `l.d` to it.\n8. It assigns the result of the expression `l.d | -(l.f && l.d) - n` to `i.g`.\n9.
