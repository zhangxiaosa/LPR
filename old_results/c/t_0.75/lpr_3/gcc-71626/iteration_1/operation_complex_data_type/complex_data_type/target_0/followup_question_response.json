The `fn2()` function is defined and returns a value of type `d`.\n4. Inside `fn2()`, there is a variable declaration `long c = fn1;` which attempts to assign the address of `fn1` to `c`. However, `fn1` is a function and cannot be assigned to a `long` variable directly. It seems like there is a typo, and it should be `long c = fn1();` to call the `fn1` function and assign its return value to `c`.\n5. There is another variable declaration `d f = {c};` that initializes a variable of type `d` with the value of `c`. Assuming `c` is correctly assigned, this statement should be fine.\n6.
