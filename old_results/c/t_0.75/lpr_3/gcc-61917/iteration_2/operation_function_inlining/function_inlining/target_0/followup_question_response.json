The target function to be optimized is `fn3`.\n2. The function `fn3` has no return type specified, so we assume it returns an `int`.\n3. The function `fn3` takes a single parameter `p1`.\n4. The function `fn3` contains a while loop that runs indefinitely (`while (1)`).\n5. Inside the outer while loop, there is another while loop that runs as long as the value of `l` is non-zero.\n6. Inside the inner while loop, there is a for loop that initializes `k` to 0 and runs as long as `k` is greater than or equal to -27. In each iteration, `k` is decremented by 6.\n7. Inside the for loop, the value of `p1` is updated as `o - p1`.\n8. After the for loop, the value of `l` is decremented by 1.\n9. After the inner while loop, there is a logical OR operation (`p1 || m22`), but the result is not assigned to any variable or used in any way.\n10. The program also includes global variables `k`, `l`, and `m22`, but they are not used in `main()`.\n\nTo optimize the program via function inlining, we need to replace all the function calls to `fn3` with the actual code of the function.
