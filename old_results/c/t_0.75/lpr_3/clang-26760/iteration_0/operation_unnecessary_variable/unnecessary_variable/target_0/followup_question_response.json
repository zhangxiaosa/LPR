Therefore, `i` can be replaced with `n` throughout the program.\n\n2. After replacing `i` with `n`, we observe that `n` is assigned the value of `g`. However, `g` is not defined within the given program. Assuming that `g` is a global variable or defined elsewhere, we can proceed with the optimization.\n\n3. We can replace all occurrences of `i` in the program with `n`.\n\n4. Since `n` is a `short` variable and `i` is also of type `short`, we can replace the type of `n` with `short` wherever it is declared.\n\n5.
