Remove the unused variable `int main() {}` since it is not related to the optimization target `m`.\n\n2. Analyze the function `fn1()`:\n   - `short n = g;` initializes variable `n` with the value of global variable `g`.\n   - `int j = 0x24F96B7BL;` initializes variable `j` with a constant value.\n   - `unsigned k;` declares variable `k` without initializing it.\n   - `if (j) --j;` checks if `j` is non-zero and decrements it if true.\n   - `int l = 1L;` initializes variable `l` with a constant value.\n   - `int m = j;` initializes variable `m` with the value of `j`.\n   - `unsigned p = n;` initializes variable `p` with the value of `n`.\n   - `q:;` defines a label `q` for a jump statement.\n   - `k = k >> l;` right-shifts `k` by the value of `l`.\n   - `n = p;` assigns the value of `p` to `n`.\n   - `if (n) { k = k << m; goto q; }` checks if `n` is non-zero, left-shifts `k` by the value of `m`, and jumps to label `q` if true.\n\n3.

Here is a step-by-step analysis and modification of the program:\n\n1. In the `fn1()` function, the variable `m` is assigned the value of `j`.\n2. Since `j` is not modified after the assignment, we can replace all occurrences of `m` with `j`.\n3. The variable `l` is assigned the value of `1L`, which is a constant.\n4. We can propagate the constant value of `l` to the right-hand side of the shift operation `k = k >> l`, resulting in `k = k >> 1L`.\n5. The `goto` statement `goto q;` can be eliminated as it is an unconditional jump to the label `q`.\n6. After the optimizations, the `fn1()` function becomes:\n```c\nshort fn1() {\n  short n = g;\n  int j = 0x24F96B7BL;\n  unsigned k;\n  if (j)\n    --j;\n  int l = 1L;\n  unsigned p = n;\nq:;\n  k = k >> 1L;\n  n = p;\n  if (n) {\n    k = k << j;\n    goto q;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n7.
