Inside the function fn1, it declares variables i of type a, j of type c, k of type e, l of type c, m of type c, n of type a, o of type c, and p of type e.\n5. It checks if j is nonzero and decrements it if true.\n6. It assigns the value 1L to l.\n7. It assigns the value of j to m.\n8. It assigns the value of g to n.\n9. It assigns the value of n to o.\n10. It assigns the value of o to p.\n11. It enters a loop labeled q.\n12. It right-shifts the value of k by the value of l.\n13. It assigns the value of p to i.\n14. It checks if i is nonzero.\n15. If i is nonzero, it left-shifts the value of k by the value of m and jumps back to the label q.\n16. The function fn1 does not return any value explicitly.\n17.
