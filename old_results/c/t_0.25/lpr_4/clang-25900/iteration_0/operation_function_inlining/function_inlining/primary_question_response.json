The program starts with several typedef statements, which define new type names for existing types. These typedef statements do not represent functions.\n\n2. The program then defines a function named `fn1` that takes two parameters (`e p1` and `int p2`) and returns a value of type `e`.\n\n3. The program defines two structs named `k` and `m`. These structs do not represent functions.\n\n4. The program declares several variables of different types (`a p`, `struct k q`, `c r`, `static a s`, `g t`, `c u`, `g v`). These variable declarations do not represent functions.\n\n5. The program defines a function named `fn2` that takes five parameters (`a p1`, `struct m p2`, `struct k p3`, `struct k p4`, `c p5`) and returns a value of type `a`.\n\n6. The program defines a function named `fn3` that takes one parameter (`g p1`) and returns a value of type `b`.\n\n7. The program defines a function named `fn4` that does not take any parameters and returns a value of type `d`.\n\n8. The program defines the `main` function, which does not take any parameters and returns an `int`.

The program defines a function `fn2` with the following signature:\n   ```\n   a fn2(a p1, struct m p2, struct k p3, struct k p4, c p5)\n   ```\n   It takes five arguments of various types and returns a value of type `a`.
