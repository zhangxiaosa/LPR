We can replace the function call `fn1(5)` with the constant `5` since the result is immediately assigned to `ad.o`.\n\n2. The value of `ad.o` is then assigned to the variable `ae`. We can replace `ae = ad.o` with `ae = u` since `ad.o` is not used afterward.\n\n3. The expression `t % (~s / ae)` involves the variables `t`, `s`, and `ae`. Since `ae` is now a constant (`u`), we can perform constant propagation and calculate the value of `~s / ae` at compile time.\n\n4. The variable `r` is assigned the result of `t % (~s / ae)`.
