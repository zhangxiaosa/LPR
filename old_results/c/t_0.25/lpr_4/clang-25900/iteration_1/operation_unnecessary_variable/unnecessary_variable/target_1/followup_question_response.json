Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:\n\n1. The variable `ae` is assigned the value of `ad.o`, which is the return value of the function `fn1(5)`.\n2. The function `fn1(p2)` simply returns the value of `p2`.\n3. In the `fn4()` function, the variable `ad` of type `struct m` is declared and initialized with the value `{1957}`.\n4. The `o` field of the `ad` struct is assigned the value returned by `fn1(5)`, which is `5`.\n5. The variable `ae` is assigned the value of `ad.o`, which is `5`.\n6. The `o` field of the `ad` struct is then assigned the value `0`.\n7. The variable `r` is assigned the result of the expression `t % (~s / ae)`.\n8.
