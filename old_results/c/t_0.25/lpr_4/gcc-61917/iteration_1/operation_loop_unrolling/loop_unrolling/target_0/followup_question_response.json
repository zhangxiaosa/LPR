Determine the loop termination condition: The loop terminates when the variable `l` becomes zero.\n\n2. Identify the loop body: The loop body consists of the statements inside the loop.\n\n3. Determine the number of iterations to unroll: To optimize the loop, we need to decide how many times the loop body should be repeated in each iteration.

Determine the number of iterations to unroll the loop. Let's assume we want to unroll the loop by a factor of 4.\n\n2. Modify the loop condition to account for the unrolling. Since the original loop condition is `l`, we need to change it to `l >= 4` to ensure we have enough iterations to unroll.\n\n3. Unroll the loop by manually duplicating the loop body 4 times. Replace the loop with the unrolled loop body:\n\n```cpp\nfor (; l >= 4; l -= 4) {\n  // Unrolled loop body\n  for (k = 0; k >= -27; k = k - 6)\n    p1 = o - p1;\n\n  for (k = 0; k >= -27; k = k - 6)\n    p1 = o - p1;\n\n  for (k = 0; k >= -27; k = k - 6)\n    p1 = o - p1;\n\n  for (k = 0; k >= -27; k = k - 6)\n    p1 = o - p1;\n\n  p1 || m_2_5;\n}\n```\n\n4.

Replace `l` with `l >= 4`:\n\n```cpp\nfor (; l >= 4; l -= 4) {\n  // Unrolled loop body\n  for (k = 0; k >= -27; k = k - 6)\n    p1 = o - p1;\n\n  for (k = 0; k >= -27; k = k - 6)\n    p1 = o - p1;\n\n  for (k = 0; k >= -27; k = k - 6)\n    p1 = o - p1;\n\n  for (k = 0; k >= -27; k = k - 6)\n    p1 = o - p1;\n\n  p1 || m_2_5;\n}\n```\n\n5.
