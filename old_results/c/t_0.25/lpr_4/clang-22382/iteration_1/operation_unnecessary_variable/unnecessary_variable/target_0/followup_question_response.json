The `goto` statement `goto w;` creates an infinite loop, so the subsequent code in `fn1` is unreachable.\n4. The function `fn2` calls `fn1` with the variable `q`, `l`, `3`, and `p` as arguments.\n5. In the `for` loop in `fn2`, the statement `p = r = p;` assigns the value of `p` to `r` and then assigns the value of `r` back to `p`. This statement does not use or assign the value of `p1`.\n6.
