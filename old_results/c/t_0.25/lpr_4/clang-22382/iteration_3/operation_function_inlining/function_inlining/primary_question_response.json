The program defines a struct named `h` with three members: `i` of type `int`, `j` of type `long`, and `k` of type `int`.\n2. The program then declares a static function named `fn1` that takes a parameter of type `struct h` and returns a value of type `struct h`.\n3. Inside the `fn1` function, there is a statement `p6.k;` which does nothing.\n4. There is a label `w` followed by a `goto` statement `goto w;`, creating an infinite loop.\n5. The program declares an unsigned function named `fn2` that takes no parameters and returns an `unsigned` value.\n6. Inside the `fn2` function, a variable `p` of type `struct h` is declared.\n7. The `fn1` function is called with the `p` variable as an argument.\n8. There is a `for` loop with no termination condition, creating an infinite loop.\n9.
