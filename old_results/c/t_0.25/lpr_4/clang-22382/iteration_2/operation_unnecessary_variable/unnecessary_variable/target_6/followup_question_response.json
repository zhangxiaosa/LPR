The program defines a struct `h` with three members: `i`, `j`, and `k`.\n2. The function `fn1` takes a parameter `p6` of type `struct h` and does nothing with it except accessing the member `k`. This access has no effect on the program's behavior.\n3. The function `fn2` has no return type specified, so it defaults to `int`. It declares a local variable `p` of type `struct h` and calls `fn1` with `p` as an argument. The return value of `fn1` is ignored.\n4. Inside an infinite loop, `fn2` declares a local variable `r` of type `struct h` and assigns `p` to `r`. Then, it assigns `r` back to `p`. This assignment has no effect on the program's behavior.\n5.
