Inside the function, there is a statement \"p6.k;\" which does nothing. After that, there is a label \"w\" and a \"goto\" statement that jumps to the label \"w\". This creates an infinite loop.\n3. The program defines another function named \"fn2\" that returns an unsigned integer. Inside the function, a variable \"p\" of type \"h\" is declared. The function calls \"fn1\" with arguments 0 and \"p\". After that, there is a \"for\" loop with an empty condition, which creates an infinite loop.
