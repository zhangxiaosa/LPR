Since `fn1` is a simple multiplication operation, there are no constant values to propagate.\n\nStep 2: Copy Propagation\n- The variable `h` is initialized as a signed integer.\n- In the function `fn2`, `h` is updated in a loop using the XOR operator (`^=`) with the result of `fn1(p3, i) && 1L`.\n- The loop iterates from `p3 = 6` to `p3 != -7` with a decrement of `p3--`.\n- The function `fn1` is called with `p3` and `i` as arguments.\n- The result of `fn1(p3, i) && 1L` is then XORed with `h` and assigned back to `h`.\n\nSince `h` is the target variable to be optimized, we need to analyze the loop conditions and the value of `fn1(p3, i) && 1L` to determine if `h` can be optimized out.\n\n- The loop condition `p3 != -7` indicates that the loop will terminate when `p3` becomes `-7`.\n- The value of `fn1(p3, i) && 1L` will be `0` (false) when `p3` is `0` or any negative value.

Therefore, if `p3` is always negative or zero, `h` will remain unchanged throughout the loop.\n\nSince the loop condition `p3 != -7` indicates that the loop will terminate when `p3` becomes `-7`, we can infer that the loop will iterate at most `14` times (`6` to `-6`, excluding `-7`). If `p3` is always negative or zero, `h` will not be modified.\n\nTo optimize out `h`, we can replace the loop in `fn2` with a single assignment of `h` to its initial value (`signed h;`) before the loop.
