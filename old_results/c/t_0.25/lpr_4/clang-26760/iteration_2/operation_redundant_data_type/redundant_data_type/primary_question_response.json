The program then enters a nested loop:\n   - The outer loop initializes `f` to 0 and checks the condition `f = 0`, which is always false. Therefore, the loop is never executed.\n   - The inner loop initializes `j` to the value of `j` and decrements `j` until it becomes 0. This loop does not modify any variables and can be considered redundant.\n4. After the nested loop, the program continues with the following statements:\n   - `k = k >> 1`: This right-shifts the value of `k` by 1 bit.\n   - `i = p`: This assigns the value of `p` to `i`.\n   - The program then checks the condition `if (i)` and enters the following block if `i` is non-zero:\n     - `k = k << j`: This left-shifts the value of `k` by the value of `j`.\n     - The program then jumps to the label `q` using the `goto` statement.\n5.
