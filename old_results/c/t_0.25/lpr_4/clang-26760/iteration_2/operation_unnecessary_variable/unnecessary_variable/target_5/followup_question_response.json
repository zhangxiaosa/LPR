However, since `g` is not defined in the given program, we cannot determine its value.\n\n4. The variable `i` is assigned the value of `p`, which is uninitialized. Therefore, the value of `i` is also uninitialized.\n\n5. The condition `if (i)` checks if `i` is non-zero. Since `i` is uninitialized, we cannot determine the outcome of this condition.\n\n6. If the condition `if (i)` is true, the variable `k` is shifted left by `j` bits.
