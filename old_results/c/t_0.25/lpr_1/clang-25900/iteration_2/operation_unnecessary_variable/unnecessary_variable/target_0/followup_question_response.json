The program defines a function `fn1` that takes an argument `p2` and returns it. Since `fn1` is not used in the program, it can be optimized out.\n\n2. The program defines a structure `m` with two signed fields `n` and `o`. The field `n` has a width of 18 bits, and the field `o` has a width of 1 bit.\n\n3.
