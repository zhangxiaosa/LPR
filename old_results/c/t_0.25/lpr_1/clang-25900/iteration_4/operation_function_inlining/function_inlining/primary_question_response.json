The program starts with the declaration of a function named `fn1` that takes a parameter `p2` and returns an `int`. The function body consists of a single statement that returns the value of `p2`.\n\n2. Next, a structure `m` is defined with two signed bit fields `n` and `o`. `n` has a width of 18 bits, and `o` has a width of 1 bit.\n\n3. An integer variable `r` is declared.\n\n4. A static signed integer variable `s` is declared and initialized with the value -5.\n\n5. Another function named `fn4` is defined, which returns a `long`. The function body consists of several statements:\n   - A variable `p2` of type `struct m` is declared and initialized with the value 1957.\n   - The `o` field of `p2` is assigned the result of calling the `fn1` function with the argument 5.\n   - A signed integer variable `ae` is declared.\n   - The value of `p2.o` is assigned to `ae`.\n   - The `o` field of `p2` is assigned the value of `r`.\n   - The value of `r` is updated by performing the modulo operation with the expression `~s / ae`.\n   - The value of `p2.o` is evaluated (but not used).\n\n6.
