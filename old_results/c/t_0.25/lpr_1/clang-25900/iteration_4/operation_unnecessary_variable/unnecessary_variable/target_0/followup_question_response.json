Identify the variable `ae` and its assignment statement: `ae = p2.o;`.\n2. Since `p2.o` is assigned to `ae`, we need to analyze the value of `p2.o`.\n3. Look for the assignment statement of `p2.o` to determine its value: `p2.o = fn1(5);`.\n4. Analyze the function `fn1` to determine its return value: `return p2;`.\n5. Since `p2` is a struct with two fields `n` and `o`, and `p2.o` is assigned the return value of `fn1`, we can conclude that `fn1` returns the value of `p2.o`.\n6.
