Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:\n\n1. The variable `c` is declared as `typedef int c;`. Since it is not used anywhere in the program, it can be optimized out.\n\n2. The variable `r` of type `c` is assigned a value in the function `fn4()`. The assignment is `r = t % (~s / ae);`.

We cannot perform constant propagation for `t`.\n\n4. The variable `s` is declared as `static signed s = -5L;`. Since it is a constant value, we can propagate its value to its usage.\n\n5. The variable `ae` is assigned the value of `p2.o` in the statement `ae = p2.o;`. We can propagate the value of `p2.o` to `ae`.\n\n6. The variable `p2.o` is assigned the value of `u` in the statement `p2.o = u;`. We can propagate the value of `u` to `p2.o`.\n\n7.

The variable `r` of type `c` is assigned a value in the function `fn4()` as `r = t % (~s / ae);`. We need to analyze the expression `t % (~s / ae)` to see if any constant propagation or copy propagation can be applied.\n\n3.

Since `c` is optimized out, the assignment `r = t % (~s / ae);` can be modified to `r = t % (~s / ae);` without affecting the program's behavior.\n\n3.

The variable `v` of type `g` is used as an argument in the function `fn1(v, 5)`.
