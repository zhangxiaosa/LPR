The program starts with a typedef statement `typedef long d;`, which creates an alias `d` for the `long` data type.\n\n2. The program defines a function `unsigned fn1(p2)` that takes an argument `p2` and returns an `unsigned` value. The return type and argument type are both primary data types.\n\n3. The program defines a structure `struct m` with two bit fields `n` and `o`. The bit fields are of type `signed` and have widths of 18 and 1, respectively. The bit fields are primary data types.\n\n4. The program declares an `int` variable `r`.\n\n5. The program declares a `static signed` variable `s` and initializes it with the value `-5L`. The variable `s` is a primary data type.\n\n6. The program declares an `int` variable `t`.\n\n7. The program defines a function `d fn4()` that returns a value of type `d` (which is an alias for `long`). The function initializes a variable `p2` of type `struct m` with the value `{1957}`. The variable `p2` is a complex data type.\n\n8. Inside the function `fn4()`, the field `o` of the variable `p2` is assigned the value returned by the function `fn1(5)`.

The function `fn1` takes an argument `p2` of an unspecified type and returns an `unsigned` value. Since the type of `p2` is not specified, we cannot determine its primary data type.\n\n3. After that, there is a struct declaration: `struct m { signed n : 18; signed o : 1; };`. The struct `m` has two members `n` and `o`, both of which are bit-fields. `n` is a signed bit-field of size 18, and `o` is a signed bit-field of size 1.\n\n4. Following the struct declaration, there are some variable declarations:\n   - `int r;` declares an `int` variable `r`.\n   - `static signed s = -5L;` declares a static `signed` variable `s` and initializes it with the value -5L (a long integer).\n   - `int t;` declares an `int` variable `t`.\n\n5.
