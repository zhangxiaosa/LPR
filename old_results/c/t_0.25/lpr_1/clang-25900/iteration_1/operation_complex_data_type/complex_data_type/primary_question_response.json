The parameter `p2` does not have an explicit data type, so it is assumed to be an `int` by default.\n\n3. Then, there is a structure declaration `struct m { signed n : 18; signed o : 1; };`. This defines a structure named `m` with two bit fields `n` and `o`, both of which are of type `signed`.\n\n4. After the structure declaration, there is a global variable declaration `int r;`.\n\n5.
