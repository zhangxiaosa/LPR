The expression `l.d | -(l.f && l.d)` can be simplified as `l.d | -l.f` because `l.d` is non-zero.\n3. The expression `-l.f` can be simplified as `-(l.f != 0)` because `l.f` is an integer.\n4. The expression `l.d | -(l.f != 0)` can be simplified as `l.d | (l.f == 0)` because `-(l.f != 0)` is equivalent to `(l.f == 0)`.\n5. The expression `l.d | (l.f == 0)` can be simplified as `l.d | (l.f == 0 ? 1 : 0)` because `l.d` and `(l.f == 0)` are boolean expressions.\n6. The expression `l.d | (l.f == 0 ? 1 : 0)` can be simplified as `(l.f == 0 ? l.d | 1 : l.d)` because `l.d | 1` is equivalent to `l.d` when `(l.f == 0)` is true.\n7.
