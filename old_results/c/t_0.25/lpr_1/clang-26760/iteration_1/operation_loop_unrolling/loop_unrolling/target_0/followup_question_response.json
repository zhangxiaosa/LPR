Loop unrolling is a technique where we duplicate loop iterations to reduce the overhead of loop control and improve performance.

Identify the loop to be optimized: `for (; j; --j)`.\n2. Determine the number of loop iterations (`n`) to unroll the loop. This value depends on the specific optimization goals and trade-offs. Let's assume we want to unroll the loop 4 times (`n = 4`).\n3. Duplicate the loop body `n` times, replacing the loop control variable `j` with a new variable for each iteration. In this case, we'll use `j1`, `j2`, `j3`, and `j4`.\n4. Modify the loop condition to combine the conditions of all unrolled iterations. In this case, we'll use the logical OR operator (`||`) to combine the conditions.\n5. Update the loop control variable `j` in each iteration to reflect the unrolled loop structure. We'll decrement the loop control variables `j1`, `j2`, `j3`, and `j4` in each iteration.\n6. Update the loop termination condition to reflect the unrolled loop structure.
