In the `if` statement within the `for` loop in `fn10`, the expression `(am - an)` is passed as an argument to the function `fn4`.

Finally, in the same `if` statement, the expression `(ao - fn4(1L - an, 0xECL)) - p2` is computed.

Inside the `if` statement in the `for` loop, the expression `am - an` is passed as an argument to the function `fn4`. Since `am` is a constant and `an` is not modified within the loop, the result of `am - an` will always be the same.

As mentioned in the previous step, `am - an` can be replaced with its constant value. Since the result of `fn4` is not used in any subsequent computations, we can optimize out the function call and replace it with its constant value.\n\n4. The expression `(ao - fn4(am - an, 0xECL)) - p2` is used in the conditional statement `(ao - fn4(am - an, 0xECL)) - p2 & 1UL`.
