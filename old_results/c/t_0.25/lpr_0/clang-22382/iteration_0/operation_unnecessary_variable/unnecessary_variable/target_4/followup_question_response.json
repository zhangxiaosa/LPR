The target variable to be optimized is `p5` in the `fn1` function.\n2. In the `fn1` function, `p5.k` is accessed but not used. Therefore, it can be optimized out.\n3. In the `fn2` function, `fn1(q, p)` is called, but the result is not used. Therefore, the call can be optimized out.\n4. In the `fn2` function, the loop `for (;;) { ... }` assigns `p` to `r`, and then assigns `r` back to `p`. This assignment is redundant and can be optimized out.\n5.

Therefore, we can optimize it out by simply removing the parameter `p5` from the function signature and the function call `fn1(q, p);` in the `fn2` function.\n\n2. After removing the unused parameter `p5`, the `fn1` function becomes:\n\n```c\nstatic struct h fn1(unsigned p1) {\n  p5.k;\nw:\n  goto w;\n}\n```\n\n3. In the `fn2` function, the statement `p = r = p;` can be optimized out using copy propagation. Since `p` is assigned the value of `r`, and then `r` is assigned the value of `p`, we can replace the assignment `p = r = p;` with `r = p;`.\n\n4. After applying copy propagation, the `fn2` function becomes:\n\n```c\nunsigned fn2() {\n  struct h p;\n  int q;\n  fn1(q);\n  for (;;) {\n    struct h r;\n    r = p;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n5.
