The target variable to be optimized is `p4`.\n2. We need to analyze the program and identify all the occurrences of `p4`.\n3. In the `fn1` function, `p4` is passed as a parameter but not used. We can remove the parameter `p4` from the function signature and the corresponding argument when calling `fn1` in the `fn2` function.\n4. After removing the unused parameter, the `fn1` function becomes:\n```c\nstatic struct h fn1(unsigned p1, struct h p5) {\n  p5.k;\nw:\n  goto w;\n}\n```\n5. In the `fn2` function, the call to `fn1` can be modified to remove the unused argument `p4`:\n```c\nfn1(q, p);\n```\n6. After the modifications, the `fn2` function becomes:\n```c\nunsigned fn2() {\n  struct h p;\n  int q;\n  fn1(q, p);\n  for (;;) {\n    struct h r;\n    p = r = p;\n  }\n}\n```\n7.
