The program defines a struct named `h` with three members: `i` of type `int`, `j` of type `long`, and `k` of type `int`.\n\n2. The function `fn1` is declared as `static` and returns a struct of type `h`. It takes two parameters: an unsigned integer `p1` and a struct of type `h` named `p5`. Inside the function, the member `k` of `p5` is accessed, but its value is not used. The function contains an infinite loop labeled `w` with a `goto` statement to jump back to the label `w`.\n\n3. The function `fn2` returns an unsigned integer. It declares a struct of type `h` named `p`. It calls the function `fn1` with arguments `0` and `p`. Then, it enters an infinite loop using a `for` loop with an empty body. Inside the loop, a new struct of type `h` named `r1` is declared, and both `p` and `r1` are assigned the value of `p`.\n\n4.
