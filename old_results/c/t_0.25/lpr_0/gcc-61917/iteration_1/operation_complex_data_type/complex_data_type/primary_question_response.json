Within the innermost loop, there is an assignment statement `p1 = 0x4FL - p1;` which subtracts `p1` from `0x4FL` and assigns the result back to `p1`.\n\n5. After the inner loop, there is an `if` statement `if (p1) m[2][5];` which checks if `p1` is non-zero and accesses the element at index `[2][5]` of the 2D array `m`.
