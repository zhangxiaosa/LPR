The variable `an` is used in the following places:\n   - Inside the `if` condition: `if (an = 250UL)`\n   - Inside the assignment to `p2`: `int p2 = ac || (an = 0)`\n   - Inside the expression `(ao - (1L - an)) - p2 & 1UL`\n\n2. Since the value of `an` is assigned the constant `250UL` in the `if` condition, we can replace all uses of `an` with the constant `250UL`.\n\n3.
