The `o` field of `ad` is assigned the value of the `u` variable.\n10. The value of `t` is divided by the bitwise negation of `s` divided by `ae`, and the result is assigned to the `r` variable.\n11. The value of `ad.o` is not used, so it can be optimized out.\n12. The `fn4` function does not have a return statement, but it has a return type of `long`.
