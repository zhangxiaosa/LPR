In the `fn4` function, the variable `ad` is declared as a struct of type `m` and initialized with the value `{1957}`. The field `o` of `ad` is then assigned the result of the function `fn1(v, 5)`.

Since the values of `af`, `s`, and `ae` are not known at compile-time, we cannot determine the value of `r` at compile-time.\n\n7. The value of `ad.o` is not used after the assignment, so it can be optimized out.\n\nBased on the analysis, we cannot optimize out the variable `ad` using constant propagation or copy propagation because its value depends on runtime values.
