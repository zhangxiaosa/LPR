Let's break it down further:\n   - `~s` is the bitwise complement of `s`, which is -5. So `~s` becomes 4.\n   - `4 / ae` is an integer division, which results in 4 / 5 = 0.\n   - Finally, `t % 0` is performed. Since the modulus operator `%` is undefined for division by zero, this expression will result in an error or undefined behavior.
