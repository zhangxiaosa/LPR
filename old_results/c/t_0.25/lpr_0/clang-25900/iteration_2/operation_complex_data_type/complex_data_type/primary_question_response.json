Next, there is a structure declaration: `struct m { int n : 18; int o : 1; };`. It defines a structure named `m` with two members, `n` and `o`, both of type `int`.\n\n3. After the structure declaration, there are several variable declarations:\n   - `int r;` declares an `int` variable named `r`.\n   - `static signed s = -5L;` declares a `signed` variable named `s` and initializes it with the value `-5L`.\n   - `unsigned t;` declares an `unsigned` variable named `t`.\n   - `int u;` declares an `int` variable named `u`.\n   - `unsigned v;` declares an `unsigned` variable named `v`.\n\n4. The next part of the program is a function definition: `long fn4() { ... }`. It defines a function named `fn4` that returns a `long` value.
