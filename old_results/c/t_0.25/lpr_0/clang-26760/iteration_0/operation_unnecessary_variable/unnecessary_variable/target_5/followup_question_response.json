Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:\n\n1. The variable `g` is declared as an `int` outside the `main` function.\n2. Inside the `main` function:\n   - The variable `j` is initialized with the hexadecimal value `0x24F96B7B`.\n   - The variable `k` is declared as an `unsigned`.\n   - If `j` is non-zero, `j` is decremented by 1.\n   - The variable `o` is assigned the value of `g`.\n   - The variable `p` is assigned the value of `g`.\n   - A label `q` is defined.\n   - The variable `k` is right-shifted by 1.\n   - If `g` is non-zero, `k` is left-shifted by `j`, and the program jumps to label `q`.\n\nTo optimize out the variable `o`, we can replace all occurrences of `o` with `g`.
