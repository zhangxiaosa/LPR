Since `h2` is initialized to a non-zero value (`0x92A1D2CDL`), the `if` statement will never be true, and the assignment to `g` will never occur.

The loop restarts, and the process repeats.\n\nTo optimize out the variable `r`, we can see that it is only used once in the assignment statement `g = r[0x06D7L][0x06D7L][0x06D7L]`.
