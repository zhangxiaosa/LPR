Then, we can replace the struct instances with their associated data types.\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. The struct `c` has the following members:\n   - `signed d : 18;` (bit-field of signed integer type with 18 bits)\n   - `unsigned e;` (unsigned integer type)\n   - `unsigned f;` (unsigned integer type)\n   - `signed g;` (signed integer type)\n   - `signed h;` (signed integer type)\n\n2. The struct instances `i` and `j` are declared as `struct c`.\n\n3. In the `main()` function:\n   - `struct c l_temp = {24, 6738, 165};` initializes a struct `c` variable `l_temp` with specific values.\n   - `l_temp.d = j.e;` assigns the value of `j.e` to `l_temp.d`.\n   - `int n = j.h && l_temp.d;` declares an integer variable `n` and assigns the result of the logical AND operation between `j.h` and `l_temp.d`.\n   - `i.g = l_temp.d | -(l_temp.f && l_temp.d) - n;` assigns the result of a bitwise OR operation between `l_temp.d` and the negation of the logical AND operation between `l_temp.f` and `l_temp.d` subtracted by `n` to `i.g`.\n\nTo optimize the program by eliminating the struct `c` and substituting it with its associated original data types, we can replace the struct instances `i` and `j` with their respective data types.
