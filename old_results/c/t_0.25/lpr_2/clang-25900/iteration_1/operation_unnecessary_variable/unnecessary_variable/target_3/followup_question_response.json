The target variable to be optimized is `p2`.\n2. The program starts with a function `fn1` that takes two parameters `p1` and `p2` and returns `p2`. Since `p2` is the target variable, it can be optimized out by replacing the function call `fn1(v, 5)` with just `5`.\n3. The program declares several variables: `r`, `s`, `t`, `u`, and `v`. None of these variables are used to compute the value of `p2`, so they can be ignored for the optimization.\n4. The program defines a struct `m` with two members `n` and `o`. The value of `o` is modified later in the program, but it is not used to compute the value of `p2`, so it can be ignored for the optimization.\n5. The program initializes an instance of the struct `m` named `ad` with the value `1957` for the member `n`. Again, this initialization is not relevant for the optimization of `p2`.\n6. The program assigns the result of the function call `fn1(v, 5)` to `ad.o`. As mentioned earlier, this can be replaced with just `5`.\n7. The program assigns the value of `ad.o` to the variable `ae`. Since `ad.o` has been replaced with `5`, `ae` can be assigned the value `5`.\n8. The program assigns the value of `u` to `ad.o`. This assignment is not relevant for the optimization of `p2`.\n9. The program computes the expression `t % (~s / ae)` and assigns the result to `r`. Since `s` is a constant `-5L` and `ae` is a constant `5`, the expression can be simplified to `t % (-5 / 5)`, which further simplifies to `t % -1`. However, since `r` is not used later in the program, this computation can be ignored for the optimization of `p2`.\n10.
