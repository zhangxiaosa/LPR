Constant Propagation:\n   - The initial value of `ad.o` is `1957`.\n   - The value of `ad.o` is updated using the function `fn1(v, 5)`. Since `fn1` returns `p2`, which is `5`, we can replace the function call with the constant `5`.\n   - The value of `ad.o` is updated with the value of `u`. If `u` is a constant, we can replace `ad.o` with the constant value of `u`. Otherwise, we need to keep the assignment as it is.\n\n2.
