Remove the function declaration and definition for `unsigned f;` and `signed g;` since they are not used in the provided code.\n\n2. Replace the function call `function_name()` with the actual code of the function.\n\n3. Inline the nested loops into the `main` function.\n\n4.

Optimize the loop by removing the inner loop since it does nothing.\n\n7. Optimize the loop by removing the outer loop since it does nothing.\n\n8.
