Inside `fn1`, there is a local variable `p5_i` which is assigned the value of `p5.i`.\n4. The program defines a function `fn2` that returns an unsigned integer.\n5.

The `main` function is empty.\n\nTo optimize out the variable `p5_i`, we can perform copy propagation. Since `p5_i` is assigned the value of `p5.i` and `p5` is not modified within `fn1`, we can replace all occurrences of `p5_i` with `p5.i`.
