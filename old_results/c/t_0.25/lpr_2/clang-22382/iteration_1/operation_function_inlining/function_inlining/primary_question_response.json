The program defines a structure named `h` with three members: `i` of type `int`, `j` of type `long`, and `k` of type `int`.\n2. It declares an unsigned integer variable `l`.\n3. It defines a static function `fn1` that takes three arguments: an unsigned integer, a short integer, and a structure of type `h`. The return type of `fn1` is also `struct h`.\n4. Inside `fn1`, there is a label `w` and a `goto` statement that jumps to the label `w`. This creates an infinite loop.\n5. It defines another function `fn2` that takes no arguments and returns an unsigned integer.\n6. Inside `fn2`, it declares a structure variable `p` of type `h`.\n7.
