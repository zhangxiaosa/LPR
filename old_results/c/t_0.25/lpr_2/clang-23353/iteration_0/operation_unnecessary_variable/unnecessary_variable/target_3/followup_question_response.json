The loop condition `p3 != -7` ensures that the loop will execute as long as `p3` is not equal to -7.\n3. In each iteration of the loop, the function `fn1` is called with the arguments `p3` and `i`.

Since the value of `p3` is not modified within the loop, we can replace all occurrences of `p3` with the constant value 6.\n5.
