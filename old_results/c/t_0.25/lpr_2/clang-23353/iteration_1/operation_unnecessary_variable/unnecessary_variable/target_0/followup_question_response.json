The function `fn2` calls `fn1` with `p3` and `i` as arguments, but the return value of `fn1` is not used.\n4. The loop in `fn2` iterates until `p3` is not equal to -7, and in each iteration, it performs a bitwise XOR operation (`^=`) between `j_h` and the result of `fn1(p3, i) && 1L`.\n5. Since the return value of `fn1` is not used and `i` is not used elsewhere, we can optimize out the call to `fn1` and the bitwise XOR operation in the loop.\n6.

The `fn2` function is the only place where `fn1` is called, and it is called with `p3` as the first argument and `i` as the second argument.\n\n4.

Since the result of `fn1(p3, i)` is being used in the program, we cannot optimize out the variable `i` completely.\n\n6. However, we can optimize the value of `i` if it is a constant. In this case, `i` is not assigned a constant value in the program, so we cannot perform constant propagation.\n\n7. We can perform copy propagation by replacing the variable `i` with its value wherever it is used.
