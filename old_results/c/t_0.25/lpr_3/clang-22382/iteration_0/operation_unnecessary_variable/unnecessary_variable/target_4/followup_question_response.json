In the function `fn1`, the statement `p5.k;` does not have any effect since the result is not used.\n3. The function `fn1` contains an infinite loop with the statement `goto w;`, which means the control flow never reaches the end of the function.\n4. The function `fn2` calls `fn1` with the variable `p5` as an argument.\n5. In the `for` loop inside `fn2`, the variables `p` and `r` are declared and assigned the value of `p`.\n6.

In the `fn2` function, the `fn1` function is called with the arguments `q`, `l`, and `p`. However, the return value of `fn1` is not used, so the assignment `p = r = p` does not affect the value of `p5`. Therefore, we can optimize out `p5` in this context as well.\n\n3.
