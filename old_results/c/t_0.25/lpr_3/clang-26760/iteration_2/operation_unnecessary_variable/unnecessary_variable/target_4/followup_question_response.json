The value of `l` is not used anywhere else in the program.\n\nSince the value of `l` is never used after its assignment, we can optimize it out by removing the declaration and assignment statement.

The variable `l` is used in the statement `k = k >> l;` inside the loop.\n4. The loop condition `if (i)` determines whether the loop is executed or not.\n5. The value of `i` is assigned the value of `p`, which is the variable `g`.\n6. The value of `p` is not modified anywhere in the program.\n7. The loop condition `if (i)` checks if `i` is non-zero.\n8. If `i` is non-zero, the value of `k` is shifted left by `m` and the program jumps to the label `q`.\n9. The label `q` is the only place where the variable `l` is used.\n10.
