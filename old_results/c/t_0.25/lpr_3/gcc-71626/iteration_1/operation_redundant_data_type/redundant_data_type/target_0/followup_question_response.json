The program defines a data type `d` using the `typedef` keyword. The `d` data type is defined as a vector of `long` elements, with the vector size determined by the `sizeof(long)` expression.\n\n2. The program then defines a function `fn2()` that returns a value of type `d`. Inside the function, it declares a variable `c` of type `long` and assigns the value of `fn1` to it. It also declares a variable `f` of type `d` and initializes it with the value of `c`. Finally, it returns the variable `f`.\n\n3. The program also includes a `main()` function, which is empty.\n\nTo eliminate the `d` data type and substitute it with the original data type (`long`), we need to modify the program as follows:\n\n```c\nlong fn2() {\n  long c = fn1;\n  long f = c;\n  return f;\n}\n```\n\nThe modified program removes the `typedef` for `d` and replaces all instances of `d` with `long`. The `fn2()` function now returns a value of type `long`, and the variable `f` is also of type `long`.

Inside `fn2()`, there are two variables declared:\n   - `long c = fn1;`: This declares a variable `c` of type `long` and assigns it the value of `fn1`. `fn1` appears to be a function, so it should be replaced with its associated original data type.\n   - `d f = {c};`: This declares a variable `f` of type `d` and initializes it with the value of `c`.
