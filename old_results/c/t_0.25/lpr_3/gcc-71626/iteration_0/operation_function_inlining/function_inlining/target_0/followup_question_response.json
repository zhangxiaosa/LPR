Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:\n\n1. The program starts with a typedef `a` which is an alias for `long`.\n2. The function `fn1` is defined, which takes no arguments and has no return value. It is an empty function.\n3. Another typedef `d` is defined as a vector of type `a` with the size of `sizeof(a)`.\n4. The function `fn2` is defined, which returns a value of type `d`. Inside `fn2`:\n   - A variable `c` of type `a` is declared and assigned the value of `fn1`.\n   - A variable `f` of type `d` is declared and initialized with the value of `c`.\n   - The variable `f` is returned.\n5. The `main` function is defined, which takes no arguments and has no return value.
