In the `main` function, a local variable `l` of type `struct c` is declared and initialized with the values `{24, 6738, 165}`.\n4. The value of `j.e` is assigned to `l.d`, effectively copying the value of `j.e` into `l.d`.\n5. A new local variable `n` is declared and assigned the value of the logical AND operation between `j.h` and `l.d`.\n6. The expression `l.f && l.d` is evaluated, and its result is negated using the unary minus operator `-`.\n7. The value of `n` is subtracted from the negated result, and the bitwise OR operation is performed between `l.d` and the subtraction result.\n8. The final result is assigned to `i.g`.\n\nTo optimize out the variable `j`, we can replace all occurrences of `j.e` with its constant value and remove the declaration of `j`.
