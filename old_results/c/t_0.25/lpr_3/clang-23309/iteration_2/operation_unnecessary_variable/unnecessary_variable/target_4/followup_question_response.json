The variable `w` is declared but not initialized.\n2. Inside the `if` statement, the value of `w` is assigned to `an` if the condition `(an = 250)` is true.\n3. The value of `an` is used in the expression `(1 - an)` as an argument to the function `fn4`.\n4. The result of `fn4(1 - an, 0xEC)` is subtracted from `ao`.\n5.

Constant propagation: Since the value of `an` is assigned as `250`, we can replace `(1 - an)` with `-249` in the expression `(ao - fn4(1 - an, 0xEC))`.\n2.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:\n\n1. The variable `w` is declared but not initialized.\n2. Inside the `if` statement, there is an assignment `an = 250`. This assigns the value 250 to `an` and also evaluates to 250.\n3. The function `fn5` is called with arguments `ab` and `ac`. Since `ac` is a constant with the value 1, the result of the function call is also a constant.\n4. The result of the function call `fn5(ab, ac)` is assigned to `p2`.\n5. The expression `(an = w)` assigns the value of `w` to `an` and also evaluates to the value of `w`.\n6. The expression `(ao - fn4(1 - an, 0xEC)) - p2 & 1` is evaluated. Since `an` is 250 and `fn4` returns the first argument `p1`, the expression simplifies to `(ao - (1 - an)) - p2 & 1`.\n7. The expression `v = af` assigns the value of `af` to `v`.\n8. The function `fn10` returns the value of `af`.\n9. In the `main` function, `fn10(u, t)` is called, but the return value is not used.\n10. The value of `v` is printed using `printf`.\n\nTo optimize out the variable `w`, we can replace all occurrences of `w` with the constant value 250.
