The target variable to be optimized is `w`.\n2. `w` is assigned the value of `an` inside the `if` statement: `p2 = fn5(ab, ac) || (an = w);`.\n3. The value of `an` is assigned `250` in the `if` statement condition: `if (an = 250)`.\n4. Since `an` is always assigned the value `250`, the condition `if (an = 250)` will always evaluate to true.\n5. Therefore, the assignment `p2 = fn5(ab, ac) || (an = w);` will always execute, and `w` will always be assigned to `p2`.\n6.
