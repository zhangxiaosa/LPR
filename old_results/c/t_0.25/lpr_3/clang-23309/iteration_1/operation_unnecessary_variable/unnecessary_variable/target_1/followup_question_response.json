Inside the `if` statement, there is a condition `(ao - fn4(1 - an, 0xEC)) - p2 & 1`. Let's break it down:\n   - `fn4(1 - an, 0xEC)` returns `1 - an`.\n   - `(ao - (1 - an))` simplifies to `(ao + an - 1)`.\n   - `(ao + an - 1) - p2` simplifies to `(ao + an - 1 - p2)`.\n   - `(ao + an - 1 - p2) & 1` performs a bitwise AND operation with `1`.\n3. If the result of the bitwise AND operation is non-zero, the expression `(ao - fn4(1 - an, 0xEC)) - p2 & 1` evaluates to true, and the assignment `v = af` is executed.\n4. Finally, the value of `af` is returned from the `fn10` function.\n\nOptimization:\n\nSince the variable `ao` is not used anywhere else in the program, we can optimize it out by removing the initialization and the condition that depends on it.
