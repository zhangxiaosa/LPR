The innermost loop has the condition `k >= -27` and updates the variable `k` by subtracting 6 in each iteration. The middle loop iterates over the variable `l`, and the outermost loop is the infinite loop.\n\nTo perform loop unrolling, we can manually unroll the loop by replicating the loop body multiple times.

In this case, the target loop is `for (;;) {`.\n\nHere's the step-by-step analysis and modification of the program:\n\n1. The target loop `for (;;) {` is an infinite loop with no termination condition. To optimize it, we need to determine the number of iterations that are necessary.\n\n2. Looking at the loop body, we see that there is a nested loop `for (; l; l++)` that increments `l` until it becomes zero. Therefore, the number of iterations of the target loop depends on the initial value of `l`.\n\n3. Since the loop condition `l` is not modified within the loop body, we can determine the number of iterations by analyzing the code before the loop.\n\n4. In the given code, the initial value of `l` is not explicitly defined. To optimize the loop, we need to assume a specific value for `l` and unroll the loop accordingly.\n\n5. Let's assume the initial value of `l` is 10. We will unroll the loop 10 times, as each iteration of the nested loop will decrement `l` by 1.\n\n6. After unrolling the loop, we need to remove the unnecessary iterations from the loop body. In this case, the loop body contains another nested loop `for (k = 0; k >= -27; k = k - 6)`. Since the loop condition `k >= -27` is always true, we can remove the loop and execute its body only once.\n\n7.
