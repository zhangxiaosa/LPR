The program declares three variables:\n   - `c k;` declares a variable `k` of type `c`, which is equivalent to `int`.\n   - `unsigned l;` declares a variable `l` of type `unsigned`.\n   - `volatile f m[5][8];` declares a 2D array `m` of type `volatile f`, which is equivalent to `volatile unsigned`.\n\n3.
