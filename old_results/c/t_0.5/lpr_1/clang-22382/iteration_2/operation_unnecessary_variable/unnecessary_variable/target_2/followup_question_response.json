Identify the target variable to be optimized: `r`.\n\n2. Analyze the program:\n   - The program defines a structure `h` with three members: `i`, `j`, and `k`.\n   - There is a static function `fn1_k` that takes a `struct h` as an argument and returns an `int`.\n   - The `fn1_k` function is called within the `fn2` function, passing a `struct h` variable `p` as an argument.\n   - In the `fn2` function, an infinite loop is created using a `for` loop with no termination condition.\n   - Inside the loop, a new `struct h` variable `r` is declared and assigned the value of `p`.\n   - The value of `r` is then assigned to `p` using the assignment operator `=`.\n   - The loop continues indefinitely, repeatedly assigning the value of `p` to `r` and vice versa.\n\n3. Perform constant propagation and copy propagation optimizations:\n   - Since the `r` variable is never used after it is assigned the value of `p`, it can be optimized out.\n   - The assignment `r = p` can be replaced with `p = p`, which has no effect.\n   - The `r` variable declaration can also be removed.\n\n4.
