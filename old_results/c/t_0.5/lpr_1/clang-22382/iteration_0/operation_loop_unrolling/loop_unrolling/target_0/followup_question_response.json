Replace the loop `for (;;) { ... }` with multiple iterations of the loop body statement `p = r = p;`.\n\n```c\ne fn2(p1) {\n  struct h p;\n  b q;\n  fn1(q, l, p1, 3, p);\n  {\n    struct h r;\n    p = r = p;\n    p = r = p;\n    p = r = p;\n    // Repeat the statement as many times as needed\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n```\n\n2. The loop body statement `p = r = p;` can be simplified to `p = r;`.\n\n```c\ne fn2(p1) {\n  struct h p;\n  b q;\n  fn1(q, l, p1, 3, p);\n  {\n    struct h r;\n    p = r;\n    p = r;\n    p = r;\n    // Repeat the statement as many times as needed\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n```\n\n3.
