The target function to be optimized is `fn1_k`.\n2. In the `fn2` function, `fn1_k` is called with a `struct h` parameter.\n3. The `fn1_k` function contains a loop with a single statement `p5.k;` and a `goto` statement that causes an infinite loop.\n4. Since the `fn1_k` function is trivial and does not have any side effects, we can optimize it out by inlining its code directly into the `fn2` function.\n5. After inlining, the `fn2` function will contain a loop with the statement `p.k;` and a `goto` statement causing an infinite loop.\n6. The `main` function is empty and does not affect the optimization process.\n\nFinal optimized program:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"program\": \"struct h {\\n  int i;\\n  long j;\\n  int k;\\n};\\n\\nunsigned fn2() {\\n  struct h p;\\n  for (;;) {\\n    struct h r;\\n    p = r = p;\\n    p.k;\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nint main() {}\\n\"\n}\n```\n\nThe `fn1_k` function has been optimized out, and its code has been inlined into the `fn2` function.
