In this case, the loop body contains only a single statement, which is the `goto w;` statement. Therefore, we can unroll the loop by replacing it with multiple instances of the `goto w;` statement.\n\nHere's the step-by-step analysis and modification of the program:\n\n1. In the `fn2` function, the loop labeled `w:;` is the target to be optimized. We will unroll this loop.\n2. Since the loop body contains only the `goto w;` statement, we can replace the loop with multiple instances of the `goto w;` statement.\n3. Let's unroll the loop by duplicating the `goto w;` statement three times. We'll replace the loop with the following code:\n```c\ngoto w;\ngoto w;\ngoto w;\n```\n4. Update the `fn2` function to include the unrolled loop:\n```c\nunsigned fn2() {\n  struct h p;\n  fn1_k(p);\n  for (;;) {\n    struct h r;\n    p = r = p;\n    goto w;\n    goto w;\n    goto w;\n  }\n}\n```\n5. Remove the `fn1_k` function declaration since it's already defined above the `fn2` function.\n6.
