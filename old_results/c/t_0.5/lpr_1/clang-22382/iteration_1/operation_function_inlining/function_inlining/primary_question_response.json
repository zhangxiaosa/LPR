The program defines a struct named `h` with three members: `i` of type `int`, `j` of type `long`, and `k` of type `int`.\n\n2. The program declares a static function `fn1` that returns a struct of type `h`. The function does not take any arguments.\n\n3. The program defines an unsigned function `fn2` that takes an unspecified number of arguments. Inside the function, it declares a struct `p` of type `h` and an integer `q`. It calls the function `fn1` with arguments `q` and `p`. It also contains an infinite `for` loop. Inside the loop, it declares a struct `r` of type `h` and assigns `p` to `r` and then assigns `r` back to `p`.\n\n4. The program defines another function `fn1` that takes an unsigned argument `p1` and a struct `p5` of type `h`. Inside the function, it accesses the member `k` of `p5` but does not use it. It contains a label `w` and a `goto` statement that jumps to the label `w`. This creates an infinite loop.\n\n5. The program defines the `main` function of type `int` that takes no arguments.
