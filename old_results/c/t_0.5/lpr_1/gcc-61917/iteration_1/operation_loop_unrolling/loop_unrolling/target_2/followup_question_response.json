In this case, the loop condition is `k >= -27`, and the loop increment is `k -= 6`. Let's unroll the loop by expanding it into multiple iterations:\n\n```cpp\nfor (k = 0; k >= -27; k -= 6) {\n  // Iteration 1\n  // Loop body code\n  \n  // Iteration 2\n  // Loop body code\n  \n  // Iteration 3\n  // Loop body code\n  \n  // ... continue unrolling until the loop condition is no longer satisfied\n}\n```\n\nSince the loop condition is `k >= -27`, we can calculate the number of iterations required by dividing the difference between the initial value of `k` and the loop termination condition by the loop increment:\n\n```\nNumber of iterations = (0 - (-27)) / 6\n                    = 27 / 6\n                    = 4\n```\n\nTherefore, we need to unroll the loop into four iterations.
