The statement `g = r[0x06D7L]` assigns the value of `r[0x06D7L]` to the variable `g`. Since `r` is not modified within the loop, the index `0x06D7L` will always access the same element of `r`.\n5. The function `fn2` does not return any value, so the `return` statement is unreachable and can be removed.\n6. The `main` function calls `fn2` but does not use the return value.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can optimize out the variable `r` by propagating the constant value `r[0x06D7L]` to the assignment statement `g = r[0x06D7L]`.
