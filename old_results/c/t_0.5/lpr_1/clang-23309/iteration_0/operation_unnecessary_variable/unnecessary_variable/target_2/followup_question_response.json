The target variable to be optimized is `p1`, which is used as an argument in the function calls `fn3(ao, fn4(fn6(am, an), 0xEC))` and `fn2(...)`.\n2. `p1` is passed as an argument to `fn6(am, an)`, where `am` is a constant value of 1 and `an` is assigned the value of `w` inside the loop.\n3. Since `w` is initialized to 3 and decremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop, the loop will execute three times with `an` taking the values 3, 2, and 1.\n4. The value of `an` is then passed as an argument to `fn6(am, an)`, which always returns `am - an` (1 - 3, 1 - 2, 1 - 1) resulting in -2, -1, and 0, respectively.\n5. The result of `fn6(am, an)` is then passed as an argument to `fn4(..., 0xEC)`, where the second argument is a constant value of 0xEC.\n6. `fn4` only uses the first argument `p1` and returns it as the result.\n7. The result of `fn4` is then passed as an argument to `fn3(ao, ...)`, where `ao` is a constant value of 0xBCD1.\n8. `fn3` performs the subtraction of the two arguments and returns the result.\n9. The result of `fn3` is finally passed as an argument to `fn2(...)` along with another argument `t`.\n10. `fn2` subtracts the two arguments and returns the result.\n11. The result of `fn2` is used in the bitwise AND operation `& 1`.\n12. If the result of the bitwise AND is non-zero, the variable `p` is assigned the value of 1.\n\nTo optimize out the variable `p1`, we can perform constant propagation and copy propagation:\n\n1. Replace the function call `fn6(am, an)` with the constant value -2, -1, or 0, depending on the value of `an` in each iteration.\n2. Replace the function call `fn4(fn6(am, an), 0xEC)` with the constant value -2, -1, or 0, depending on the value of `an` in each iteration.\n3. Replace the function call `fn3(ao, fn4(fn6(am, an), 0xEC))` with the constant value `0xBCD1 - (-2)`, `0xBCD1 - (-1)`, or `0xBCD1 - 0`, depending on the value of `an` in each iteration.\n4. Replace the function call `fn2(fn3(ao, fn4(fn6(am, an), 0xEC)), t)` with the constant value `0xBCD1 - (-2) - t`, `0xBCD1 - (-1) - t`, or `0xBCD1 - 0 - t`, depending on the value of `an` in each iteration.\n5. Replace the bitwise AND operation `fn2(...) & 1` with the constant value `0xBCD1 - (-2) - t & 1`, `0xBCD1 - (-1) - t & 1`, or `0xBCD1 - 0 - t & 1`, depending on the value of `an` in each iteration.\n6.
