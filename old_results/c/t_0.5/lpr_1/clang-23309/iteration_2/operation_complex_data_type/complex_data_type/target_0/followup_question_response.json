Define the function `fn4` with the return type `char` and two parameters of type `unsigned int`: `p1` and `p2`. The function returns the value of `p1`.\n\n2. Define the variables:\n   - `p` of type `short`\n   - `t` of type `int`\n   - `w` of type `short`\n   - `ac` of type `short` and initialize it to 1\n\n3. Define the `main` function with the return type `int`.\n\n4. Define the variables inside the `main` function:\n   - `an` of type `int`\n   - `ao` of type `short` and initialize it with the hexadecimal value `0xBCD1`\n\n5. Start a `for` loop with the condition `w = 3`. The loop continues as long as `w` is non-zero. After each iteration, decrement `w` by 1.\n\n6. Inside the `for` loop, check if `an` is assigned the value 250 using the assignment operator `=`. If the condition is true, execute the following block of code:\n\n   - Assign the result of the logical OR operation `ac || (an = w) == 0x294A85636008822` to `t`. The logical OR operation checks if `ac` is non-zero or if the result of the comparison `(an = w) == 0x294A85636008822` is true.\n   \n   - Calculate the expression `(ao - fn4(1 - an, 0xEC) - t) % 2`. This expression subtracts the result of the function `fn4` called with parameters `1 - an` and `0xEC` from `ao`, subtracts `t` from the result, and then calculates the modulo 2 of the final result.\n   \n   - If the result of the above expression is non-zero, assign the value 1 to `p`.\n\n7.
