The function `fn1` is called with `v` and `5` as arguments, but the return value is not used. This call does not affect the optimization of `p1`.\n\n3. The struct `m` is declared with a field `o` of type `signed` and initialized with the value `1957`. The field `o` is then assigned the return value of `fn1(v, 5)`. Again, this assignment does not affect the optimization of `p1`.\n\n4. The variable `ae` is declared and assigned the value of `ad.o`. This assignment does not involve `p1`.\n\n5. The variable `ad.o` is assigned the value of `u`. This assignment does not involve `p1`.\n\n6. The variable `r` is assigned the result of the expression `t % (~s / ae)`. This expression does not involve `p1`.\n\n7. The expression `ad.o` is evaluated but not used in any assignment or computation. Since `ad.o` is not used, we can optimize it out.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that the variable `p1` is unused and can be optimized out.

Since `ad.o` is now a constant `5`, we can replace `ae = ad.o` with `ae = 5`.\n\n5. The expression `t % (~s / ae)` is assigned to `r`. Since `ae` is a constant `5`, we can replace `~s / ae` with `~s / 5` and perform the division.\n\n6. The value of `ad.o` is accessed without any effect.
