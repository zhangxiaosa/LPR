The target function to be optimized is `fn4()`.\n2. Start by analyzing the function and identifying any function calls within it.\n3. In the `fn4()` function, there is a function call to `fn1(v, 5)`.\n4. The `fn1()` function can be inlined by replacing the function call with its body.\n5. The body of `fn1()` is `return p2;`, so we can replace the function call with `return 5;`.\n6.
