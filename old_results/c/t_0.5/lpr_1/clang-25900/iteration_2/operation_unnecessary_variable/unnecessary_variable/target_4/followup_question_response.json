The variable `p1` is declared as the first parameter of the function `fn1(unsigned p1, int p2)`.\n2. The function `fn1` is called with the arguments `5` and `5` in the statement `ad.o = fn1(5, 5);`.\n3. The return value of `fn1` is assigned to the member `ad.o`.\n4. The value of `ad.o` is then assigned to the variable `ae` in the statement `ae = ad.o;`.\n5. The value of `u` is assigned to the member `ad.o` in the statement `ad.o = u;`.\n6. The expression `t % (~s / ae)` is calculated and assigned to the variable `r`.\n7. The value of `ad.o` is accessed in the statement `ad.o;`, but it is not used or assigned to any variable.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that the variable `p1` is not used in the program.
