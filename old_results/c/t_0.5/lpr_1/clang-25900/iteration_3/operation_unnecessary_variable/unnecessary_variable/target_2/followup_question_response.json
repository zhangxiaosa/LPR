The variable `s` is a static signed variable with the value `-5L`, which is a constant. We can replace all occurrences of `s` with the constant `-5`.\n\n3. The variable `t` is an unsigned variable, but it is not assigned any value in the program. Since it is unused, we can remove it from the program.\n\n4. The variable `u` is an integer variable, but it is not assigned any value in the program. Since it is unused, we can remove it from the program.\n\n5. The struct `ad` has two members: `n` and `o`. The member `n` is not used in the program, so we can remove it. The member `o` is assigned the value of `fn1(5)`, which can be replaced with the constant `5`.\n\n6. The variable `ae` is assigned the value of `ad.o`, which is a constant `5`. We can replace all occurrences of `ae` with the constant `5`.\n\n7. The statement `ad.o = u` assigns the value of `u` to `ad.o`, but `u` is unused and has no assigned value. We can remove this statement.\n\n8. The expression `~s / ae` can be simplified to `~(-5) / 5`, which is equivalent to `-(-6) / 5` and further simplified to `6 / 5`. Since both operands are constants, we can replace this expression with the constant `1`.\n\n9. The expression `t % 1` is equivalent to `t % 1`, which is always `0`. We can replace the assignment statement `r = t % 1` with the constant assignment `r = 0`.\n\n10.
