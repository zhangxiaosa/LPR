Since the target is to optimize `r`, we need to decompose it into variables with primary data types.\n3. We can start by decomposing `r` into three separate variables: `r0`, `r1`, and `r2`.\n4. `r0` will be a 1-dimensional array of type `int` with size `5`.\n5. `r1` will be a 2-dimensional array of type `int` with dimensions `[9][5]`.\n6. `r2` will be a 3-dimensional array of type `int` with dimensions `[5][9][5]`.\n7. We can then modify the code to use these decomposed variables. The assignment `g = r[i][i][i]` will become `g = r2[i][i][i]`.\n8.
