Here's the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. Since `r2` is a local variable within the `fn2` function, we can analyze its usage within the loop and determine if it can be optimized out.\n\n2. Inside the loop, there is an `if` statement with the condition `h2`. If `h2` is true, the function returns `0xC3L`, and `r2` is not used. Therefore, if `h2` is always true, we can optimize out `r2`.\n\n3. The value of `h2` is `0x92A1D2CDL`, which is non-zero. Hence, the `if` condition `h2` is always true, and we can optimize out `r2`.\n\n4. After optimizing out `r2`, the program becomes:\n\n```cpp\nunsigned g;\nint h2 = 0x92A1D2CDL;\n\nunsigned fn2() {\n  for (;;) {\n    if (h2)\n      return 0xC3L;\n  }\n}\n\nint main() {\n  fn2();\n}\n```\n\n5.

If `h2` is non-zero, the function returns `0xC3L`.\n3. If `h2` is zero, the value of `r2` is copied to `g`.\n4.
