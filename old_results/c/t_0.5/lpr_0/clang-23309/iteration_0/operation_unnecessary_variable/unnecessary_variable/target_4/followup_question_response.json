Here's the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. In the `fn10` function, the variable `ao` is assigned the constant value `0xBCD1L` within the loop. Since `ao` is not used anywhere else, we can optimize it out by removing the assignment statement.\n\nModified `fn10` function:\n```c\nchar fn10(unsigned p1, short p2) {\n  int an;\n  for (w = 3; w; w -= 1)\n    if (an = 250UL) {\n      p2 = ac || (an = w) == 0x294A85636008822DLL;\n      if ((ao - fn4(1L - an, 0xECL)) - p2 & 1)\n        v = 1UL;\n    }\n  return 3L;\n}\n```\n\n2. Since `ao` is no longer used, we can remove the declaration of `ao` from the `fn10` function.\n\nModified `fn10` function:\n```c\nchar fn10(unsigned p1, short p2) {\n  int an;\n  for (w = 3; w; w -= 1)\n    if (an = 250UL) {\n      p2 = ac || (an = w) == 0x294A85636008822DLL;\n      if ((fn4(1L - an, 0xECL)) - p2 & 1)\n        v = 1UL;\n    }\n  return 3L;\n}\n```\n\n3. Since the `fn10` function is unchanged, we can move to the `main` function.\n\n4. In the `main` function, the `fn13` function is called, which in turn calls `fn10`. However, the return value of `fn10` is not used. Therefore, we can optimize out the call to `fn10` and remove the assignment of its return value.\n\nModified `main` function:\n```c\nint main() {\n  fn13();\n  p = v;\n  printf(\"checksum = %d\\n\", p);\n  return 0;\n}\n```\n\n5.
