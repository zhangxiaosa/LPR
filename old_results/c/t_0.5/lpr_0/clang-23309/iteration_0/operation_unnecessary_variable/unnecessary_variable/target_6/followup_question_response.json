Since `ac` is a constant with the value of 1, we can simplify the expression to `p2 = 1`.\n\n2. The if statement `(ao - fn4(1L - an, 0xECL)) - p2 & 1` is checking if the result of `(ao - fn4(1L - an, 0xECL)) - p2` is odd.

The variable `v` is assigned the value of 1UL if the simplified expression `(ao - fn4(1L - an, 0xECL)) - 1 & 1` is true.
