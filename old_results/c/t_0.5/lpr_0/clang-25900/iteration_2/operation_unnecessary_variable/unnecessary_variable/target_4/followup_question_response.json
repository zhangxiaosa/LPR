Here are the steps to optimize the program:\n\n1. Remove the unused variable `p1` from the function `fn1(unsigned p1, int p2)`.\n\n2. Replace all occurrences of `fn1(0, 5)` with the constant value `5`. This is possible because the function `fn1` always returns its second argument `p2`, and in this case, `p2` is a constant `5`.\n\n3. Replace the assignment `ae = ad.o` with `ae = 5`. This is because the value of `ad.o` is set to `5` in the previous step.\n\n4. Replace the expression `~s / ae` with the constant value `-1`. This is because `~s` is equivalent to `~(-5L)`, which is `4` in two's complement representation, and `4 / 5` is `0` in integer division.\n\n5. Replace the expression `t % (-1)` with the constant value `0`. This is because any number modulo `-1` is always `0`.\n\n6.
