Since `n` is not used anywhere in the program, it can be optimized out.\n\n2. The variable `o` is assigned the result of the function `fn1(v, 5)`. Since `v` is an unsigned variable and `5` is a constant, the result of the function call will always be `5`. Therefore, the assignment `ad.o = fn1(v, 5)` can be simplified to `ad.o = 5`.\n\n3. The variable `ae` is assigned the value of `ad.o`, which is `5`. Since `ad.o` is a constant, `ae` can be replaced with the constant `5` in subsequent computations.\n\n4. The variable `u` is assigned to `ad.o`. Since `ad.o` is a constant and `u` is an `int` variable, the assignment can be simplified to `u = 5`.\n\n5. The expression `(~s / ae)` involves bitwise negation of `s` followed by division by `ae`. Since `s` is a constant and `ae` is a constant (both equal to `5`), the expression can be simplified to `(~-5L / 5)`, which evaluates to `-(-6L / 5)`.\n\n6. The expression `t % (-(-6L / 5))` involves modulus division of `t` by the result of the previous expression.
