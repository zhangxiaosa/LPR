The function `fn1` is called with arguments 0 and 5, and the return value is assigned to `ad.o`. Since the arguments are constants, we can replace the function call with the constant value 5.\n3. The value of `ad.o` is assigned to the variable `ae`.\n4. The variable `ad.o` is assigned the value of `u`. Since `u` is not defined or used anywhere in the program, we can optimize it out.\n5. The expression `~s / ae` is evaluated and used to calculate the new value of `r`. Since `s` is a constant value of -5, we can replace `~s` with 4 (bitwise negation of -5) and perform constant folding to calculate the new value of `r`.\n6.
