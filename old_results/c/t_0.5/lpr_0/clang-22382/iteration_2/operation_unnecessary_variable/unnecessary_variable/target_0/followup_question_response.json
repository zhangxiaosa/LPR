The `struct h` struct is used in the `fn1` function as a parameter, but the `i` member is not accessed or used within `fn1`.\n4. The `fn1` function contains an infinite loop with a `goto` statement, which means that the program will never reach the end of the function.\n5. The `fn2` function calls `fn1` with a `struct h` parameter `p`, but the return value of `fn1` is not used or assigned to any variable.\n6.

In the function `fn1`, the variable `p5` of type `struct h` is passed as an argument, but the member `i` is not used.

However, the return value of `fn1` is not assigned to any variable, so the optimization does not apply here.\n6. The loop in `fn2` assigns the value of `p` to `r`, and then assigns `r` back to `p`. Since the optimization is targeting `i`, and `i` is a member of `h`, the assignment `p = r` does not affect `i`. Therefore, the optimization does not apply here.\n7.

In `fn1`, the variable `p5` of type `struct h` is passed as a parameter but its member `k` is not used. We can optimize out the unused variable by removing the statement `p5.k;`.\n4. In `fn2`, the function `fn1` is called with the `p` variable of type `struct h`. However, the result of the function call is not used. Since `fn1` does not modify the `p` variable, we can optimize out the function call and remove the statement `fn1(p);`.\n5. In the `for` loop in `fn2`, the `p` variable of type `struct h` is assigned the value of `r` which is also of type `struct h`. However, both variables have the same value, so we can optimize out the assignment and remove the statement `p = r = p;`.\n6. In the `main` function, there are no statements or operations involving the target variable `i`.
