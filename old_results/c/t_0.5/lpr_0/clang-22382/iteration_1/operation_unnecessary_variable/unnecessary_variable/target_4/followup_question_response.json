Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. The variable `p2` is only used as a parameter in the function `fn1`. Since `fn1` does not use `p2` anywhere, we can optimize it out by removing the parameter.\n\n2. Update the function signature of `fn1` to remove the unused parameter `p2`:\n   ```c\n   static struct h fn1(struct h p5)\n   ```\n\n3. Remove the unused variable `p2` from the function body of `fn1`:\n   ```c\n   struct h fn1(struct h p5) {\n     p5.k;\n   w:\n     goto w;\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. In the `fn2` function, the call to `fn1` can be updated to remove the unused argument `l`:\n   ```c\n   fn1(p);\n   ```\n\n5. The `for` loop in the `fn2` function assigns `p` to `r`, which is then assigned back to `p`. Since `p` is not used outside the loop, we can remove the assignment and simplify the loop:\n   ```c\n   for (;;) {\n     struct h r;\n     p = r;\n   }\n   ```\n\n6.
