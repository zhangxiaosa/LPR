Identify the associated original data types for each member of the struct \"h\":\n   - \"signed i\" -> \"signed\"\n   - \"long j\" -> \"long\"\n   - \"unsigned k\" -> \"unsigned\"\n\n2. Replace every instance of the struct \"h\" with its associated original data types:\n   - Replace \"struct h p\" in fn2 with \"signed i, long j, unsigned k\"\n   - Replace \"struct h r\" in the for loop with \"signed i, long j, unsigned k\"\n   - Replace \"struct h p5\" in fn1 with \"signed i, long j, unsigned k\"\n\n3. Remove the struct definition \"struct h\" from the program.\n\n4. Update the function signatures and calls to match the modified data types:\n   - Change the return type of fn1 from \"struct h\" to \"unsigned\"\n   - Update the fn1 function definition to match the modified parameter types:\n     - Change \"unsigned p1\" to \"signed\"\n     - Change \"short p2\" to \"long\"\n     - Remove \"struct h p5\" since it has been replaced with individual data types\n   - Update the fn1 function call in fn2 to match the modified argument types:\n     - Change \"fn1(q, l, p)\" to \"fn1(q, (short)l, p.i, p.j, p.k)\"\n\n5.
