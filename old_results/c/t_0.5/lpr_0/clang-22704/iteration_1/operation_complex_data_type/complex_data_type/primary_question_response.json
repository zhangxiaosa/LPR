The program starts with the declaration of a variable `f` of type `int`.\n2. Next, there is a function `fn1()` defined, which returns a `char` value.\n3. Inside `fn1()`, there is an `if` statement that checks the value of `f`. This implies that `f` is a variable of type `int`.\n4. Inside the `if` block, there is a `goto` statement, which jumps to the label `i`. This indicates that `i` is a label, not a variable.\n5. After the `goto` statement, there is a recursive call to `fn1()`, indicating that `fn1` is a function.\n6. Following the recursive call, a variable `j` of type `char` is declared.\n7. The value of `j` is not assigned before the return statement, so it is uninitialized.\n8.
