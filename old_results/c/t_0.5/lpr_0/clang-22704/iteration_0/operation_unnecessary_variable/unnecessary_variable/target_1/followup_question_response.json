Inside `fn1`, a local variable `h` is declared and initialized with the constant value `6L`.\n4. There is an `if` statement that checks the value of `f`. If `f` is non-zero, the program jumps to the label `i`.\n5. If `f` is zero, the `fn1` function calls itself recursively.\n6. After the recursive call, a local variable `j` of type `char` is declared.\n7. The value of `j` is not initialized in the code provided, so its value is undefined.\n8.
