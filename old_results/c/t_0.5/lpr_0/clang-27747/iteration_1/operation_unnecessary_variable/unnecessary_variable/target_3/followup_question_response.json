The variable `n` is initialized with the logical AND of `i.h` and `l.d`. The value of `i.h` is not known from the given code, so we cannot perform constant propagation on it. However, we can perform copy propagation for `l.d` since it is assigned the value of `i.e`.\n\n2. After the copy propagation, the assignment statement `l.d = i.e` can be removed, and all occurrences of `l.d` can be replaced with `i.e`.\n\n3. The updated assignment statement `i.g = i.e | -(l.f && i.e) - n` can be simplified further. The expression `-(l.f && i.e)` is a logical NOT of the result of `l.f && i.e`. If `l.f` and `i.e` are both non-zero, the logical AND will be true, resulting in `-1` after the logical NOT. Otherwise, the logical NOT will be `0`. So, the expression can be simplified to `-(l.f && i.e)`.\n\n4. The updated assignment statement `i.g = i.e | -(l.f && i.e) - n` can be further simplified. Since `n` is `i.h && i.e`, we can substitute its value in the expression, resulting in `i.g = i.e | -(l.f && i.e) - (i.h && i.e)`. \n\n5. The final assignment statement `i.g = i.e | -(l.f && i.e) - (i.h && i.e)` can be optimized by performing constant propagation.

If the values of `l.f` and `i.e` are known, we can compute the values of `(l.f && i.e)` and `(i.h && i.e)` and substitute them into the assignment statement. If either of these expressions evaluates to `0`, the corresponding term in the assignment statement will be `0`, simplifying the expression further.\n\n7. If the values of `l.f` and `i.e` are not known, we cannot perform constant propagation on `(l.f && i.e)` and `(i.h && i.e)`. However, we can still perform copy propagation on `i.e` in the assignment statement.\n\n8.
