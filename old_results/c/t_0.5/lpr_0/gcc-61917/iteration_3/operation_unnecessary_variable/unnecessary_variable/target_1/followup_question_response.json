Let's analyze the function to see if we can optimize out `o`.\n\n1. The `for` loop in `fn3` iterates while `l` is non-zero and decrements `l` in each iteration.\n2. Inside the `for` loop, the variable `k` is set to 0 and then decremented by 18 in each iteration until it becomes less than or equal to -27.\n3. The expression `p1 = o - p1` is executed in each iteration, where `o` is subtracted from `p1` and the result is assigned back to `p1`.\n\nSince `o` is not initialized or modified within the loop, its value remains constant throughout the loop execution. Therefore, we can determine its value at compile-time.\n\nTo optimize out `o`, we can replace the expression `p1 = o - p1` with `p1 = <constant_value> - p1`, where `<constant_value>` represents the determined value of `o`.
