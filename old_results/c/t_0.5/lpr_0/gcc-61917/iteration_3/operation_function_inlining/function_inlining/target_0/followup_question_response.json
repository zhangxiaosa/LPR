The target function to be optimized is `fn3`.\n2. The function `main` does not contain any code, so it can be removed.\n3. Inlining `fn3` means replacing all the function calls to `fn3` with the actual code of the function.\n4. The function `fn3` has a loop that iterates `l` times. The loop initializes `k` to 0 and continues as long as `k` is greater than or equal to -27. In each iteration, `p1` is updated by subtracting `o` from it.\n5. Since the loop iterates `l` times, we can replace the loop with the actual code inside the loop `l` times.\n6. The initial value of `k` is 0, and it is decremented by 18 in each iteration. So the loop will have `(l / 18)` iterations, and the final value of `k` will be `-18 * (l / 18)`.\n7. The value of `o` is not defined in the given code snippet. Assuming it is a constant, we can replace `o` with its actual value.\n8.
