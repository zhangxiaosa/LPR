Loop unrolling is a technique where multiple iterations of a loop are combined into a single iteration, reducing the overhead of loop control and improving performance.\n\nIn this case, we can unroll the loop by a factor of 4. Here's the modified program with loop unrolling:\n\n```c\nint k;\nunsigned l;\nunsigned fn3(p1) {\n  int o;\n  for (; l >= 4; l -= 4) {\n    for (k = 0; k >= -27; k = k - 18) {\n      p1 = o - p1;\n      p1 = o - p1;\n      p1 = o - p1;\n      p1 = o - p1;\n    }\n  }\n\n  // Handle remaining iterations (less than 4)\n  for (; l; l--) {\n    p1 = o - p1;\n  }\n\n  return p1;\n}\n\nint main() {}\n```\n\nIn the optimized version, we unrolled the loop by a factor of 4.
