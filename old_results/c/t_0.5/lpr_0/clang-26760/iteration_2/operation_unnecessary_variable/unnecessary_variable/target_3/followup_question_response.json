If `g` is non-zero, the code inside the `if` block will execute. Otherwise, it will be skipped.\n\n6. Inside the `if` block, `k` is left-shifted by `j` bits and then assigned back to `k`. Since `j` is initialized to a constant value (`0x24F96B7B`), the left shift operation is effectively multiplying `k` by a constant.
