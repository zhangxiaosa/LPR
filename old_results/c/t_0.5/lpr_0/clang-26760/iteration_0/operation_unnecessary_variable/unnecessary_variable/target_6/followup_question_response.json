We need to determine if `i` is constant or can be replaced with a constant.\n11. The value of `i` is assigned the value of `p`. Since `p` is replaced with `o`, we need to determine if `o` is constant or can be replaced with a constant.\n12. The value of `o` is assigned the value of `n`. We need to determine if `n` is constant or can be replaced with a constant.\n13. The value of `n` is assigned the value of `g`.

There is no assignment to `g` within the program, so we cannot propagate a constant value for `p` from `g`.\n4.
