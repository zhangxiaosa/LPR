If the optimized value of `p` is not used anywhere else in the program, remove the assignment and declaration of `p` altogether.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given program:\n\n1. Analysis:\n   - The variable `l.d` is assigned the value of `j.e`.\n   - The variable `n` is assigned the logical AND of `j.h` and `l.d`.\n   - The variable `p` is assigned the value of `l.d` bitwise OR the negation of the logical AND of `l.f` and `l.d`, minus `n`.\n   - The variable `i.g` is assigned the value of `p`.\n\n2.
