Remove the `return` statement from the function body since it's not used in the program.\n4. Remove the label `q` and the `goto q` statement since they are not used in the program.\n5. Remove the unused variables `i`, `k`, `o`, and `p` from the function body.\n6. Remove the nested `for` loop since it doesn't have any effect on the program.\n7.
