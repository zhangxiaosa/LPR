Since `k` is not modified within the loop, this operation can be moved outside the loop.\n\n5. Inside the loop, `k` is shifted left by `j` (`k = k << j`) if `p` is non-zero. However, `p` is always zero since it is assigned the value of `g`, which is optimized out. Therefore, the shift operation can be eliminated.\n\n6.
