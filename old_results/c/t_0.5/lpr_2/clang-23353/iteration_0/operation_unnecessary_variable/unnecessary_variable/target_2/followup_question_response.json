Since the loop condition does not depend on `p3`, we can optimize it out.\n4. The loop iterates from `p3 = 6` until `p3 != -7`, decrementing `p3` by 1 in each iteration.\n5. We can replace the loop condition `p3 != -7` with `1` since it will always evaluate to true.\n6. We can remove the assignment `p3 = 6` as it is not necessary.\n7. The function `fn1(p3, i)` is called in each iteration of the loop. However, the result of the function call is not used for any computation. We can optimize out this function call.\n8. The expression `j ^= fn1(p3, i) && 1L` can be simplified to `j ^= 1L` since the result of the function call is always `1L` due to the optimization in step 7.\n9.
