Constant propagation: The value of `p3` in the `for` loop is initialized to `6` and decremented by `1` in each iteration until it becomes `-7`. Therefore, the loop runs for `6 - (-7) + 1 = 14` iterations.\n4. Copy propagation: The function `fn1(p3, i)` is called inside the loop, but the result is not used. Therefore, the function call can be replaced with its return value directly.\n5. The bitwise XOR operation `^=` is applied between `j` and `fn1(p3, i) && 1L`. Since the result of `fn1(p3, i)` is always `p3 * i` and the bitwise XOR with `1L` does not affect the result, the expression can be simplified to `j ^= p3 * i`.\n6.
