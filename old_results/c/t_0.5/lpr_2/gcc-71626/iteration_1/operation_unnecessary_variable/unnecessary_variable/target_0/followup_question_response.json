The target variable to be optimized is `c` in the function `fn2()`.\n2.

It is unclear whether `fn1` is a constant or not. Assuming it is a constant, we can proceed with constant propagation.\n4. Constant propagation replaces variables with their constant values. In this case, `c` is initialized with `fn1`, so we can replace `c` with `fn1` throughout the program.\n5.
