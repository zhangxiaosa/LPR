The typedef `typedef a d __attribute__((__vector_size__(sizeof(a))));` creates another data type `d` which is an array of `a` with a size equal to the size of `a` (which is `long`).\n\n4. The function `fn2()` is defined, which returns a value of type `d`. Inside this function:\n   - A variable `c` of type `a` is declared and assigned the value of `fn1`.\n   - A variable `f` of type `d` is declared and initialized with a single element, which is the value of `c`.\n   - The function returns the variable `f`.\n\n5.
