Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. The program defines several typedefs (`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`) and a structure `h` with members `i`, `j`, and `k`.\n2. It declares a global variable `l` of type `d`.\n3. It defines a static function `fn1` that takes four parameters: `f`, `g`, `d`, and `struct h`. The function has an infinite loop labeled `w` and a single statement that jumps to the `w` label.\n4. It defines another function `fn2` that takes a single parameter `p1` of type `e`. Inside `fn2`, it declares a local variable `p` of type `struct h` and calls `fn1` with arguments `l`, `p1`, `3`, and `p`.\n5. Inside `fn2`, there is an infinite loop that declares a local variable `r` of type `struct h` and assigns `p` to both `r` and `p`.\n6. The `main` function is defined but doesn't contain any statements.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can see that the variable `p3` is not used anywhere in the program.

After removing `p3` from the function definition and call, the optimized `fn2` function becomes:\n```c\ne fn2(p1) {\n  struct h p;\n  fn1(l, 3, p);\n  for (;;) {\n    struct h r;\n    p = r = p;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n6.
