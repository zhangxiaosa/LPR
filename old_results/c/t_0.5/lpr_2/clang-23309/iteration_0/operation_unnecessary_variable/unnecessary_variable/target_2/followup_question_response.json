Since `ao` is a constant, we can replace `ao` with its value, resulting in `if (fn2(0xBCD1 - fn4(fn6(1, an), 0xEC), ab) & 1)`.\n3.

Inside the loop, the condition `if (an = 250)` assigns the value 250 to `an` and checks if the assignment was successful (non-zero).\n4. If the condition is true, the variable `ab` is updated using the function `fn5(ab, ac)`, and the result is stored in `ab`. Additionally, the condition `(an = w) == 0x294A85636008822D` is evaluated and its result is assigned to `ab`.\n5. The variable `ao` is assigned the value 0xBCD1.\n6. The condition `if (fn2(ao - fn4(fn6(1, an), 0xEC), ab) & 1)` checks if the result of the expression is bitwise ANDed with 1 and evaluates to non-zero.\n7. If the condition is true, the variable `v` is assigned the value 1.\n8.
