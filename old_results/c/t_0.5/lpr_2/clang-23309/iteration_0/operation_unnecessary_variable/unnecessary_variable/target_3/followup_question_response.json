Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. The variable `p` is initially set to 0 and is not used until the end of the program, where its value is printed. We can optimize it out by removing all the assignments and references to `p`.\n\n2. In the `fn13` function, there is a loop where the variable `w` is decremented from 3 to 0. Inside the loop, there are conditions that involve the variable `an` and the function calls `fn2`, `fn4`, `fn5`, and `fn6`. However, none of these conditions affect the value of `p`, so we can ignore this loop for our optimization.\n\n3. The `fn13` function ends with a return statement that always returns 3. Since the return value is not used, we can optimize it out as well.\n\n4. In the `main` function, the `fn13` function is called, but its return value is not used. We can remove the function call and the assignment to `p` since `p` is no longer used.\n\n5. The `printf` statement at the end of the `main` function prints the value of `p`.

The condition `fn2(ao - fn4(fn6(1, an), 0xEC), ab) & 1` can be simplified by constant propagation and copy propagation.\n   - `fn6(1, an)` can be replaced with `1 - an` since `fn6` calculates the difference between its arguments.\n   - `fn4(1 - an, 0xEC)` can be replaced with `1 - an` since `fn4` only returns its first argument.\n   - `ao - (1 - an)` can be simplified to `ao + an - 1`.\n   - `fn2(ao + an - 1, ab) & 1` can be replaced with `(ao + an - 1) & 1` since `fn2` subtracts the second argument from the first and performs a bitwise AND with `1`.\n   - The condition simplifies to `(ao + an - 1) & 1`.\n4.
