The program starts with the declaration of an unsigned function named `fn1` that takes a single parameter `p2` and returns an unsigned value. The function body consists of a single statement `return p2;`.\n\n2. Next, a structure named `m` is defined with two signed members `n` and `o`. `n` is a 18-bit signed integer, and `o` is a 1-bit signed integer.\n\n3. An unsigned variable `r` is declared.\n\n4.
