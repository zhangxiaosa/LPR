Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. The program starts with the declaration of the function `fn1` with the return type `unsigned` and a parameter `p2`.\n   - Variable(s) with complex data type: None\n\n2. Next, a structure `m` is defined with two bit fields `n` and `o`.\n   - Variable(s) with complex data type: `struct m`\n\n3. An unsigned variable `r` is declared.\n   - Variable(s) with complex data type: None\n\n4. A static signed variable `s` is declared and initialized with the value `-5L`.\n   - Variable(s) with complex data type: None\n\n5. The `main` function is defined.\n   - Variable(s) with complex data type: None\n\n6. Inside the `main` function, a variable `ad` of type `struct m` is declared and initialized with the values `1957` and the result of the function call `fn1(5)`.\n   - Variable(s) with complex data type: `ad`\n\n7. A signed variable `ae` is declared.\n   - Variable(s) with complex data type: None\n\n8. The value of `ad.o` is assigned to `ae`.\n   - Variable(s) with complex data type: None\n\n9. The expression `4 % (~s / ae)` is evaluated, and the result is assigned to `r`.\n   - Variable(s) with complex data type: None\n\n10. The statement `ad.o;` doesn't have any effect and can be removed.\n   - Variable(s) with complex data type: None\n\nBased on the analysis, the variables with complex data types in the program are `struct m` and `ad`.
