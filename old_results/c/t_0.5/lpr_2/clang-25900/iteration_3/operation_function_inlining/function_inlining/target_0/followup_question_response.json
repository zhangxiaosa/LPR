The target function to be optimized is `fn1(p2)`, which simply returns the value of `p2`.\n2. The function `fn1` is called in the initialization of the `struct m` variable `ad` with the argument `5`.\n3. The variable `ad` is initialized with the values `1957` and the result of calling `fn1(5)`.\n4. The value of `ad.o` is assigned to the variable `ae`.\n5. The value of `ad.o` is assigned to `ad.o`, which has no effect.\n6. The value of `t` is divided by the bitwise negation of `s` divided by `ae`, and the result is assigned to `r`.\n7. The value of `ad.o` is evaluated but not used in any assignment or operation.\n\nTo optimize the code by inlining the `fn1` function, we can replace the function call with its return value wherever it is used.
