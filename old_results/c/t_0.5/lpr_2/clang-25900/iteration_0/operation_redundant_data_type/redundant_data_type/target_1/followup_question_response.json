The program defines three typedefs:\n   - `c` is defined as `int`.\n   - `e` is defined as `unsigned`.\n   - `g` is defined as `unsigned`.\n\n2. The program defines a function `fn1` that takes an `e` parameter `p1` and an `int` parameter `p2`. It returns an `e`.\n\n3. The program defines a struct `m` with two bit fields:\n   - `n` is a signed bit field with a width of 18 bits.\n   - `o` is a signed bit field with a width of 1 bit.\n\n4.
