Remove the typedef declaration for `typedef unsigned e;` and substitute every instance of `e` with `unsigned`.\n4. Remove the typedef declaration for `typedef unsigned g;` and substitute every instance of `g` with `unsigned`.\n5. Update the function `fn1` to reflect the change in the parameter type. Change `e p1` to `unsigned p1`.\n6. Update the struct `m` to reflect the change in the member type. Change `signed n : 18;` to `int n : 18;`.\n7. Update the variable declarations to reflect the change in types:\n   - `a s = -5L;` becomes `signed s = -5L;`\n   - `c r;` becomes `int r;`\n   - `g t;` becomes `unsigned t;`\n   - `c u;` becomes `int u;`\n   - `g v;` becomes `unsigned v;`\n   - `a ae;` becomes `signed ae;`\n   - `c af = t;` becomes `int af = t;`\n8. Update the expression `r = af % (~s / ae);` to reflect the change in types. Change `af % (~s / ae)` to `r = af % (~s / (unsigned)ae);`.\n9.
