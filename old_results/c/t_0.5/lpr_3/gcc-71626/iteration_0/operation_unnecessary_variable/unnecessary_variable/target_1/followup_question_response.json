Since `fn1` is a function and not a variable, we cannot propagate its value directly. However, we can see that `fn1` is an empty function with no side effects. Therefore, we can optimize out the call to `fn1` and replace `c` with a constant value of 0.\n3. After constant propagation, the assignment `d f = {c};` becomes `d f = {0};`.\n4.
