The program starts with a function declaration `fn1()` which takes no arguments and has no return type. We can eliminate this function since it is not used in the program.\n\n2.

Since the target is to optimize `d`, we need to substitute every instance of `d` with `long`.\n\n3. The program then defines a function `fn2()` which returns a variable of type `d`. Inside the function, it declares a variable `c` of type `long` and assigns `fn1` to it. We can eliminate the assignment since `fn1` is not a valid value for a `long` variable.\n\n4. The function also declares a variable `f` of type `d` and initializes it with the value of `c`. We need to substitute `d` with `long` in this case.\n\n5.
