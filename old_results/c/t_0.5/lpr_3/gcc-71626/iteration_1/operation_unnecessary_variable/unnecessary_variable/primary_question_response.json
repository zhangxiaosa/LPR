The program defines a function `fn1()` without any parameters or return type.\n2. It then defines a `typedef` for a type `d` which is a `long` with a vector size attribute.\n3. Next, it defines a function `fn2()` which returns a value of type `d`.\n4. Inside `fn2()`, it declares a local variable `c` of type `long` and assigns the address of `fn1` to it. However, `fn1` should be invoked as `fn1()` to call the function.\n5. It also declares a local variable `f` of type `d` and initializes it with the value of `c`.\n6. Finally, `fn2()` returns `f`.\n7.
