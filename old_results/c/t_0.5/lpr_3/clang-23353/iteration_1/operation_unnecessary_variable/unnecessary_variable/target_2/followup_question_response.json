Here is the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. The variable `p1` is only used in the `fn1` function, so we will focus on optimizing it within that function.\n\n2. In the `fn1` function, the expression `return p1 * p2;` is the only place where `p1` is used. Since `p1` is the target variable to be optimized, we can replace it with a constant value.\n\n3. Since the value of `p1` is not specified in the given program, we will assume it to be a constant value of `1` for the purpose of optimization.\n\n4. After replacing `p1` with the constant value `1`, the `fn1` function becomes `char fn1(char p2) { return 1 * p2; }`.\n\n5. Now, we need to propagate the optimized value of `p1` to the `fn2` function.\n\n6. In the `fn2` function, the call to `fn1` becomes `j_h ^= fn1(p3, i) && 1L;`.\n\n7. Since the first argument `p3` is not affected by the optimization, we only need to optimize the second argument `i`.\n\n8. Assuming `i` is a constant value of `0` for the purpose of optimization, the call to `fn1` becomes `j_h ^= fn1(p3, 0) && 1L;`.\n\n9. Finally, the optimized `fn2` function becomes:\n```c\nint fn2(p3) {\n  for (p3 = 6; p3 > -4; p3 -= 4)\n    j_h ^= fn1(p3, 0) && 1L;\n  return 0;\n}\n```\n\n10.
