The program declares a variable `l` of type `d` (which is typedefed as `unsigned`).\n\n4. The program defines a static function `fn1` that takes the following parameters:\n   - `p1` of type `f` (which is typedefed as `unsigned`).\n   - `p2` of type `short`.\n   - `p3` of type `g` (which is typedefed as `unsigned`).\n   - `p4` of type `d` (which is typedefed as `unsigned`).\n   - `p5` of type `struct h`.\n\n   The function has a loop that uses the value of `p5.k`.\n\n5.
