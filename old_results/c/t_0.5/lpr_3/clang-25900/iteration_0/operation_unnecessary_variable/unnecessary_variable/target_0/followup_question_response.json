If `ad.o` is indeed `5`, then `ae` will also be `5`.\n4. `ad.o = u;` - The value of `u` is assigned to `ad.o`.

The final result is assigned to `r`. Since `s` is a constant `-5L`, and `ae` is `5` (if `ad.o` is `5`), we can calculate `~s / ae` as `~(-5L) / 5`, which simplifies to `-(-6L) / 5` and further to `6L / 5`.
