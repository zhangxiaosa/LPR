The statement `signed p = l.d | -(l.f && l.d) - n;` initializes the variable `p` with a bitwise OR operation, negation, subtraction, and the value of `n`. Since `j` is the target variable to be optimized, we need to analyze the expression and perform the necessary optimizations.\n\n   - `l.d` is a copy of `j.e`, which can be propagated directly.\n   - `l.f && l.d` is a logical AND operation involving `l.f` and `l.d`. We can propagate the value of `l.f` because it is a constant in this program.\n   - `-n` is the negation of `n`, which is the same as negating `j.h` since `n` is a copy of `j.h`.\n\n   After performing the optimizations, the expression simplifies to `p = j.e | -(l.f) - j.h`.\n\n6.
