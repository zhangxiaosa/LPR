Here is the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. The variable `j` is declared as a global variable of type `struct c`. It is initialized by default to zero since it is a global variable.\n\n2. In the `main()` function, a local variable `l` of type `struct c` is declared and initialized with the values `{24, 6738, 165}`.\n\n3. The statement `l.d = j.e;` assigns the value of `j.e` to `l.d`. Since `j` is a global variable and its fields are not modified, we can replace `j.e` with its constant value, which is `0`. Therefore, the statement can be optimized to `l.d = 0;`.\n\n4. The statement `int n = j.h && l.d;` assigns the logical AND of `j.h` and `l.d` to the variable `n`. Since `j` is a global variable and its fields are not modified, we can replace `j.h` with its constant value, which is `0`. Therefore, the statement can be optimized to `int n = 0;`.\n\n5. The statement `j.g = l.d | -(l.f && l.d) - n;` assigns the result of the expression `l.d | -(l.f && l.d) - n` to `j.g`. Since `j` is a global variable and its fields are not modified, we can replace `l.d` with its constant value, which is `0`. Therefore, the expression can be optimized to `0 | -(l.f && 0) - 0`, which simplifies to `0 | 0 - 0`, and further simplifies to `0`.\n\n6.
