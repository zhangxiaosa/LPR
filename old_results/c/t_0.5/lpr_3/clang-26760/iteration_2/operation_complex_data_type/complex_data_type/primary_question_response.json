The program starts with the declaration of the `main` function.\n2. Inside the `main` function, the following variables are declared:\n   - `signed i;` - This variable has a complex data type (`signed`).\n   - `int j = 0x24F96B7BL;` - This variable has a primary data type (`int`).\n   - `unsigned k;` - This variable has a primary data type (`unsigned`).\n   - `unsigned p = g;` - This variable has a primary data type (`unsigned`).\n3. The program then enters an `if` statement with the condition `if (j)`.\n4. Inside the `if` statement, the decrement operator `--` is applied to the variable `j`.\n5. After the `if` statement, the variable `p` is assigned the value of the variable `g`.\n6. The program encounters a label `q:`.\n7. The variable `k` is right-shifted by 1 bit (`k = k >> 1L;`).\n8. The variable `i` is assigned the value of the variable `p`.\n9. The program enters another `if` statement with the condition `if (i)`.\n10. Inside the nested `if` statement, the variable `k` is left-shifted by the value of `j`.\n11. The program encounters a `goto` statement, which jumps back to the label `q`.\n12.
