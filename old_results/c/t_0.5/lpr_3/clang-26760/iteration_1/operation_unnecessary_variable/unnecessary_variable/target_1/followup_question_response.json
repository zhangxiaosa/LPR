The target variable to be optimized is `n`.\n2. We can see that `n` is assigned the value of `g`.\n3. The value of `g` is not defined in the given program. If `g` is not used anywhere else in the program, we can optimize out `n` by removing the assignment statement.\n4. Since `n` is not used anywhere else in the program, we can safely remove the declaration and assignment of `n`.\n5.
