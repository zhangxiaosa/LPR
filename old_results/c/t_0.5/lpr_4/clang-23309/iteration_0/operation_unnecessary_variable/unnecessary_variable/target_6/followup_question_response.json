The target variable to be optimized is `p2` in the `fn10` function.\n2. In the `fn10` function, `p2` is assigned the value of the `fn5` function with arguments `ab` and `ac`.\n3. Since the value of `ab` is not provided in the given code, we cannot determine the exact value of `p2` at compile time.\n4. Therefore, constant propagation is not possible for `p2`.\n5. However, we can perform copy propagation for `p2`.\n6. The assignment `p2 = fn5(ab, ac)` can be replaced with `p2 = ac`.\n7. This optimization simplifies the code by removing the unnecessary function call to `fn5`.\n8.

Let's assume the constant value assigned to `p2` is `c2`. The condition becomes:\n   ```\n   if ((ao - fn4(1L - an, 0xECL)) - c2 & 1UL)\n   ```\n\n3. In the `main` function, the variable `t` is assigned a constant value:\n   ```\n   t = 1UL;\n   ```\n   Since `t` is not used anywhere else in the program, we can optimize it out.\n\n4. In the `main` function, the `fn10` function is called with arguments `u` and `t`:\n   ```\n   fn10(u, t);\n   ```\n   Since `t` is no longer used, we can remove it from the function call:\n   ```\n   fn10(u);\n   ```\n\n5.
