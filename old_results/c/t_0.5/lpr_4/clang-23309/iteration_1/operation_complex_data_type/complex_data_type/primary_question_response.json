Inside the `main()` function, there is a declaration of the variable `an` of type `int`, which is also a simple data type.\n\n3. Within the `for` loop, there is an assignment statement `an = 250UL`, where `250UL` represents an unsigned long value.

Similar to the previous case, this assignment is not a declaration of a new variable.\n\n5. Inside the nested `if` statement, there is a function call `fn4(1L - an, 0xECL)`. The function `fn4` is declared with a return type of `char` and takes two parameters of type `char`. The expressions `1L - an` and `0xECL` involve long and long long values, respectively.
