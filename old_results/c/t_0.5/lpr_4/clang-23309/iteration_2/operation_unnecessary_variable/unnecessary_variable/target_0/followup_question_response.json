The variable `an` is assigned the value `250UL` inside the `if` statement. Since this assignment is constant, we can replace all occurrences of `an` with `250UL` within the `if` statement.\n\n2. The expression `(an = w) == 0x294A85636008822DLL` is assigned to `t`. Since `an` is always assigned the value of `w` (which is `3` in this case), we can replace `(an = w)` with `3` within the `if` statement.\n\n3. The expression `(ao - fn4(1L - an, 0xECL)) - t & 1UL` is used in the `if` statement. Since `an` has been replaced with `250UL` in step 1 and step 2, we can simplify this expression further.\n\n4. The expression `1L - 250UL` can be simplified to `-249L`.\n\n5. The function `fn4` takes two arguments, `1L - 250UL` and `0xECL`. Since the first argument is a constant expression, we can evaluate it. `1L - 250UL` is `-249L`, so we can replace `1L - an` with `-249L` within the function call.\n\n6. After evaluating the function call `fn4(-249L, 0xECL)`, we get the result `1L`.\n\n7. The expression `(ao - fn4(1L - an, 0xECL)) - t` simplifies to `(0xBCD1L - 1L) - t`, which further simplifies to `0xBCD0L - t`.\n\n8. The expression `(0xBCD0L - t) & 1UL` can be simplified to `0xBCD0L & 1UL` since `t` is either `0` or `1`.\n\n9.

The variable `t` is assigned the result of the expression `ac || (an = w) == 0x294A85636008822DLL`.
