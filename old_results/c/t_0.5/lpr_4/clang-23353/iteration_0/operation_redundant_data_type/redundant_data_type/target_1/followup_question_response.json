The target type to be optimized is `b`, which is defined as `typedef int b`. We need to eliminate this type and replace every instance of it with `int`.\n\n2. The function `char fn1(char p1, char p2)` returns a `char` type. Since `b` is equivalent to `int`, we can change the return type to `int` as well: `int fn1(char p1, char p2) { return p1 * p2; }`.\n\n3. The structure `struct g` contains a member `signed h`. We don't need to modify this structure because it doesn't involve the target type `b`.\n\n4. Variable `i` is of type `b`, so we replace it with `int`: `int i;`.\n\n5. Variable `j` is of type `struct g`, so we don't need to modify it.\n\n6.
