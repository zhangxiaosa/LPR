We'll assume it has a default value of 0.\n\n2. The function `fn1` is defined, which returns a `short`.

If `g` is true, `k` is shifted left by `j` bits. Otherwise, `k` is shifted right by 1 bit. We can replace the variable `k` with a constant value based on the initial condition of `g`.\n\n3. The inner `for` loop is an infinite loop since there is no termination condition. Therefore, the code inside the loop is unreachable.
