The program defines several typedefs: `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e`.\n2. It declares variables `f` of type `d` and `g` of type `a`.\n3. It defines a function `fn1` that returns a value of type `b`.\n4. Inside the function, it declares variables `i` of type `a`, `j` of type `c`, `k` of type `e`, `l` of type `c`, `m` of type `c`, `n` of type `a`, `o` of type `c`, and `p` of type `e`.\n5.
