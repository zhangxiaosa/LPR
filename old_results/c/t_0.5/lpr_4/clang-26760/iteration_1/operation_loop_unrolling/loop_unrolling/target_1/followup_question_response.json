Loop unrolling is a technique where multiple iterations of the loop are executed together in a single iteration.

Remove the loop `for (unsigned f; f;)` since it is optimized out.\n\n2. Unroll the inner loop `for (; j; j -= 4)` by four iterations.

The loop `for (unsigned f; f;)` has no initialization expression, condition, or update expression. It means that the loop will only execute if the value of `f` is non-zero.\n\n2.
