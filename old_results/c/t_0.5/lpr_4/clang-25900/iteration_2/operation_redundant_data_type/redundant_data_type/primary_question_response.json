The program starts with a function definition: `int fn1(int p1, int p2) { return p2; }`. No redundant data types are defined in this function.\n\n2. Next, a structure is defined: `struct m { signed n : 18; signed o : 1; };`. The structure defines two bit-field members, `n` and `o`, with specific widths. The data type `struct m` is a user-defined data type and should be included in the JSON.\n\n3.
