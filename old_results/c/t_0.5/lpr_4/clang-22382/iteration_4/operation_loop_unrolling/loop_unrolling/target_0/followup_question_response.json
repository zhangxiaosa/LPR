In this case, since the loop body is simply assigning `p = r = p`, we can unroll the loop by directly repeating this assignment multiple times.\n\nHere's the step-by-step analysis and modified program:\n\n1. The original program:\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nstruct h {\n  int i;\n  long j;\n  int k;\n};\n\nstatic struct h fn1(struct h p5) {\n  int p5_i = p5.i;\nw:\n  goto w;\n}\n\nunsigned fn2() {\n  struct h p;\n  struct h r;\n  fn1(p);\n  for (;;)\n    p = r = p;\n}\n\nint main() {\n  return 0;\n}\n```\n\n2. We need to optimize the loop `for (;;)` in the `fn2` function.\n3. Since the loop body is `p = r = p;`, we can unroll the loop by repeating this assignment multiple times.\n4. Let's unroll the loop 4 times:\n```c\nunsigned fn2() {\n  struct h p;\n  struct h r;\n  fn1(p);\n  p = r = p;\n  p = r = p;\n  p = r = p;\n  p = r = p;\n}\n```\n\n5.
