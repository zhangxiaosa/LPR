The program starts with the definition of a struct named \"h\" with three members: an integer \"i\", a long integer \"j\", and another integer \"k\".\n\n2. After that, there is an unsigned integer variable \"l\" declared.\n\n3. Next, there is a static function named \"fn1\" defined, which takes five parameters: an unsigned integer \"p1\", a short integer \"p2\", two unsigned integers \"p3\" and \"p4\", and a struct \"p5\" of type \"h\".\n\n4. Inside the \"fn1\" function, there is a signed integer variable \"p5_i\" declared and assigned the value of the \"i\" member of the struct \"p5\".\n\n5.
