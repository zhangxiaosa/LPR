The function `fn1` is defined as static and returns a struct `h`. It takes two parameters: an unsigned int `p1` and a struct `h` `p5`.\n3. Inside `fn1`, a local variable `p5_i` is declared and initialized with the value of `p5.i`.\n4. There is an infinite loop labeled `w` with a `goto` statement to jump back to the `w` label. This loop will never terminate.\n5. The function `fn2` is defined as returning an unsigned int.\n6. Inside `fn2`, two local variables are declared: `p` and `r`, both of type struct `h`.\n7. The function `fn1` is called with arguments 0 and `p`.\n8. There is an infinite loop using a `for` statement with an empty body. Inside the loop, `p` and `r` are assigned the value of `p` (copy propagation).\n9.
