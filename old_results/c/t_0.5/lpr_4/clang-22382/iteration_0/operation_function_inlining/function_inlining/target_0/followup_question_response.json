Replace all occurrences of `fn1(q, l, p1, 3, p)` in the function `fn2` with the body of `fn1`:\n```c\nstruct h p;\nb q;\np5.k;\nw:;\ngoto w;\n```\n\n2. Remove the declaration of `fn1` from the program since it's no longer needed.\n\n3. Update the function signature of `fn2` to match the inlined code:\n```c\ne fn2(p1) {\n  struct h p;\n  b q;\n  struct h p5;\n  p5.k;\nw:;\n  goto w;\n}\n```\n\n4. Remove the unused variables `p2`, `p3`, and `p4` from the function `fn1` since they are not used in the inlined code.\n\n5. Remove the unused variables `p2`, `p3`, and `p4` from the function signature of `fn1` since they are not used.\n\n6. Remove the unused variable `r` from the loop in `fn2` since it's not used.\n\n7. Remove the `for` loop in `fn2` since it doesn't serve any purpose after inlining.\n\n8.
