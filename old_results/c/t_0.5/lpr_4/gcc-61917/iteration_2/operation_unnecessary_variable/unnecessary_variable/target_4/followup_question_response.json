The loop condition for the outer loop is `l`, which is initially set to 1 and incremented in each iteration of the outer loop.\n4. The loop condition for the inner loop is `k >= -27`, and `k` is initialized to 0 and decremented by 6 in each iteration of the inner loop.\n5. After the nested loop, there is a logical OR operation between `p1` and `m_25`, but the result is not assigned to any variable.\n6.
