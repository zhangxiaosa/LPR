The variable `l_hi` is of type `long` and is used to store the high-order bits of the value of `l`, while the variable `l_lo` is of type `long` and is used to store the low-order bits of the value of `l`. This allows the program to avoid the use of a single `long` variable for `l`, which can help to optimize the program by reducing the number of memory accesses required to perform the computation.",
