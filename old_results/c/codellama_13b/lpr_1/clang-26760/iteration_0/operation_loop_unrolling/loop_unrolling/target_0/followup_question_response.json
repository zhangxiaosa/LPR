We first find the number of iterations of the outer loop that will be executed. In this case, it is 4 times the number of iterations of the inner loop.\n2. We then copy the contents of the inner loop 4 times, each with a different value for the loop counter `j`.\n3. We then replace the outer loop with a condition that checks the value of `f` and branches to the corresponding copy of the inner loop.\n4. We then remove the outer loop and the condition that checks the value of `f`.\n\nThe resulting optimized program executes the outer loop 4 times and the inner loop 16 times, which is the same number of iterations as the original program.
