The optimization is done by replacing the `if` statement with a `goto` statement that jumps to the end of the loop if the condition is true. This eliminates the need to execute the `if` statement and the code inside it, which reduces the overhead of the loop.\n\nThe `for` loop is also optimized by eliminating the initialization and increment statements, since they are not used in the optimized version of the program.\n\nNote that the `goto` statement can be problematic in some cases, since it can make the code harder to read and understand. However, in this case, it is used to simplify the code and improve its performance.",
