The variable `j_hi` is also declared as an `int`, which is a primary data type. The variable `f` is not declared, so it will have an implicit type of `int` by default. The variable `p` is declared as an `int`, but it is assigned the value of `g`, which is an `int`.\n\nThe program is the same as the original program, with the exception that the variables are now declared with explicit primary data types.

The variable `p` is also of type `unsigned`, but it is initialized to the value of `g`, which is not explicitly declared in the code snippet provided.\n\nThe optimization target is `k`, which is of type `unsigned`. The optimization can be achieved by using the fact that the `k` variable is initialized to 0 and then incremented by 1 in each iteration of the inner loop. This means that the `k` variable can be replaced with a simple counter variable, which starts from 0 and is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the inner loop.
