This can be done by creating separate variables for each member of the struct, and then using those variables to access the struct members.\n\nFor example, the variable `h_low` can be extracted from the struct and used to perform the bitwise operations.\n```\nint h_low_i, h_low_j, h_low_l;\n\nint main() {\n  h_low_l = h_low_j;\n  int n = h_low_j && h_low_l;\n  h_low_i = h_low_l | -(165 && h_low_l) - n;\n}\n```\nThis optimization can help to improve the performance of the program by reducing the number of memory accesses and improving the cache behavior.",

The variable `h_low` of type `int` has been replaced with `h_low_l` and `h_low_j`, and the variable `n` of type `bool` has been replaced with `n`.\n\nThis decomposition is a common technique used in compiler optimization, as it allows the compiler to reason about the program in a more straightforward way, by dealing with smaller, simpler pieces instead of complex data types.\n\nIt is important to note that the compiler will only perform this decomposition if it is able to determine that the program will not exhibit undefined behavior as a result of the decomposition. In this case, the decomposition is safe because the program does not access or modify any other members of the `struct c_new` variable, so the decomposition will not introduce any undefined behavior.",
