Since this variable is used in both expressions, it cannot be optimized out.\n\nHowever, if we look at the expressions individually, we can see that `l.d` is used in both expressions, and `l.f` is only used in one expression. Therefore, we can optimize out `l.f` by replacing all occurrences of `l.f` with `l.d` in the expression `l.f && l.d`, and then removing the variable `l.f` entirely.\n\nThe optimized program would look like this:\n```\nstruct c {\n  signed d : 18;\n  unsigned e;\n  unsigned f;\n  signed g;\n  signed h;\n} i, j;\nint fn1() {\n  struct c l = {24, 6738, 165};\n  l.d = j.e;\n  int n = j.h && l.d;\n  int o = l.d;\n  signed p = o | -(l.d && l.d) - n;\n  i.g = p;\n}\nint main() {}\n```\nIn this optimized program, the variable `l.f` has been removed, and all occurrences of `l.f` have been replaced with `l.d`.
