It is used to store the low-order 18 bits of the `int` value.\n\nNote that the variable `l` is not used in the program, so it can be removed. The program can be optimized by removing the variable `l` and the line `l.h_low = i.h_low;`\n\nThe optimized program is:\n```\nstruct c_new {\n  int h_low : 18;\n};\n\nstruct c_new i;\n\nint main() {\n  int h_low = i.h_low;\n  int n = i.h_low && h_low;\n  i.h_low = h_low | -(165 && h_low) - n;\n}\n```",
