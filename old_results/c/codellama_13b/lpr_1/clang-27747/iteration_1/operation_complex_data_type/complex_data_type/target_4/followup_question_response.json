The only complex data type used in the program is the struct c, which has been decomposed into its individual components. The components are then used to perform the same calculations as the original program.\n\nIn this case, the optimization is not significant, but it is an example of how to decompose a complex data type into its primary components. In more complex programs, this technique can be used to simplify the code and make it more maintainable.",

Similarly, the variable `i.e` is decomposed into `e_low`, `e_high`, `e_middle` and `e_xor` which are all integer variables with values of `0xFF`, `0xFF`, `0xFF` and `0xFFFFFF` respectively.\n\nBy decomposing the variables with complex data types into variables with primary data types, we can make the program easier to understand and optimize.",
