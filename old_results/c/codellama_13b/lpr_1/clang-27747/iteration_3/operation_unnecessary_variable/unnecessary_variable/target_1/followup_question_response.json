Instead, the value of `h_low_1` is directly assigned to `i.h_low`.\n\nNote that this optimization is done using a technique called \"constant propagation\" or \"copy propagation\". This technique involves analyzing the code and identifying variables that are assigned a constant value, and then replacing all uses of the variable with the constant value. In this case, `h_low_1` is assigned the value `p`, which is a constant expression that is calculated using other variables in the program. By replacing all uses of `h_low_1` with `p`, we can eliminate the unnecessary variable and simplify the code.",
