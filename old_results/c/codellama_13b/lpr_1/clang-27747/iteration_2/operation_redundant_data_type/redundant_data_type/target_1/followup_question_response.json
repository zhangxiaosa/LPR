The `main` function is also modified to use the optimized data types and instances.",

To eliminate the data type and substitute every instance with its associated original data type, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Declare a new type that is a combination of the fields of `struct c`\n2. Replace instances of `struct c` with the new type\n3. Replace references to the fields of `struct c` with references to the corresponding fields of the new type\n\nHere is the modified program:\n```\nstruct c_new {\n  int h : 18;\n  int g;\n} i, j;\nint main() {\n  struct c_new l;\n  l.h = j.h;\n  int n = j.h && l.h;\n  int p = l.h | -(165 && l.h) - n;\n  i.g = p;\n}\n```\nIn this program, the `struct c` type has been eliminated, and the `struct c_new` type has been introduced to replace it.
