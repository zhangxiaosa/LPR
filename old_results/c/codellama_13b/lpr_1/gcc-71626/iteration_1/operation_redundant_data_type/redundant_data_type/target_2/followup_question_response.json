The `typedef` keyword is used to create a new name for an existing data type. In this case, `a` is a new name for the data type `long`. By eliminating the `typedef` and replacing every instance of `a` with `long`, we are replacing the `typedef` with its associated original data type.\n\nNote that the `__attribute__((__vector_size__(sizeof(long))))` part is also eliminated from the code. This is because it is not necessary to include this part in the optimized code. The `__attribute__` keyword is used to specify attributes for a function or variable, and in this case, it specifies that the function `fn2` should have a size equal to the size of `long`. Since we are eliminating the `typedef` and replacing every instance of `a` with `long`, this attribute is no longer necessary.",
