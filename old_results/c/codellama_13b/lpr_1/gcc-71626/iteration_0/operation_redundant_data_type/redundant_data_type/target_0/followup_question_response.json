The `d` type from the original program is also removed, as it is not necessary. The `fn1` function returns a `long` value, which is assigned to a variable of type `long` in the `fn2` function. The `fn2` function returns a `long` value, which is assigned to a variable of type `long` in the `main` function. The `main` function is also simplified by removing the unnecessary `d` type.",

This is because `a` is a typedef for a long data type, and all instances of `a` in the program can be replaced with `long` to make the program more readable and easier to understand.",

Additionally, the `__attribute__((__vector_size__(sizeof(a))))` attribute has been removed from the `d` typedef, as it is not needed in this program.\n\nI hope this helps!

The `fn1` function is also declared as a `void` function that returns nothing. The `d` struct is declared with a single `long` member variable named `c`.
