The function is defined in the same file and is called directly within the function body without any additional overhead. The function does not have any local variables or other function calls, so there is no opportunity for the compiler to perform any optimizations.\n\nHowever, if we look at the function calls, we can see that `fn2` calls `fn1` with the same arguments multiple times, which can potentially be optimized. Here is an example of how we can optimize the function calls:\n```\na fn1(b m, c n, d o, a p) {\n  for (;;) {\n    c q = 0xC3L;\n    b r[5][9][5];\n    if (h[2])\n      return q;\n    g = r[i][i][i];\n  }\n}\n\nd fn2() {\n  b m = 0x92A1D2CDL;\n  c n = 0x92A1D2CDL;\n  d o = 0x92A1D2CDL;\n  a p = 0x92A1D2CDL;\n  for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {\n    fn1(m, n, o, p);\n  }\n  return m;\n}\n```\nIn this optimized version, we have inlined the `fn1` function directly into the body of `fn2`, eliminating the overhead of function calls. This optimization can potentially improve the performance of the program.\n\nNote that this optimization is not guaranteed to always improve performance, and it may not be possible to optimize all function calls in this way. The compiler may have other optimizations that can improve performance in other parts of the program.",
