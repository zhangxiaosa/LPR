These data types can be removed from the program without affecting its functionality.\n\nIt is important to note that the program also contains a data type called \"static d i = 0x06D7L;\" which is not redundant. The \"static\" keyword indicates that the variable \"i\" has static storage duration, which means it exists throughout the entire execution of the program, and its value is preserved between function calls. This data type is not redundant because it has a different storage duration than the other data types, and its value is used in the function \"fn1\".",
