The `if` statement in the `fn1` function has no side effects, so it can be optimized out.\n4. The `r` array is not used in the program, so it can be optimized out.\n5. The `q` variable is not used in the program, so it can be optimized out.\n6. The `i` variable is not used in the program, so it can be optimized out.\n\nThe resulting program after optimization is:\n```\nint fn1(int, unsigned, unsigned, int);\nint fn1(int m, unsigned n, unsigned o, int p) {\n  return 0xC3L;\n}\nint main() { fn1(0, 0, 0, 0); }\n```",
