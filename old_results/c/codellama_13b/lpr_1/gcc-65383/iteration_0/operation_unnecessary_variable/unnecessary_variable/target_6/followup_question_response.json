This is a constant value, and it can be replaced with a single `unsigned` variable with the same value. The program will still work correctly with this optimization.\n\nThe variable `q` is also a constant value, and it is used only once in the program.

Additionally, the variable `q` is replaced by its constant value `0xC3L` in the function `fn1`.\n\nHere is the explanation of the optimization techniques used:\n\n1. Constant Propagation: The value of `i` is constant throughout the program and is never modified, so it can be replaced by its constant value `0x06D7L` in the function `fn1`.\n2. Copy Propagation: The value of `g` is never used in the function `fn1`, so it can be removed completely.\n3. Dead Code Elimination: The variable `q` is only used in the function `fn1`, and it is assigned a constant value `0xC3L` which is never used. Therefore, it can be removed.\n\nThe resulting program is smaller and faster due to the removal of unused variables and the application of constant propagation and copy propagation.",
