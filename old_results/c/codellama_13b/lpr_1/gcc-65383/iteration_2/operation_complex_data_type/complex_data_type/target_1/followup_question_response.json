We can do this by modifying the program as follows:\n```\nint g;\nint h3 = 0x92A1D2CD;\nint fn1() {\n  for (;;) {\n    int r3[5];\n    if (h3)\n      return 0xC3L;\n    g = r3[0x06D7];\n  }\n}\nint main() { fn1(); }\n```\n\nAfter the optimization, the program becomes:\n```\nint g;\nint h3 = 0x92A1D2CD;\nint fn1() {\n  for (;;) {\n    int r3[5];\n    if (h3)\n      return 0xC3L;\n    g = r3[0x06D7];\n  }\n}\nint main() { fn1(); }\n```\nThe pointer `g` has been replaced with a variable `r3` that stores the value of `r3[0x06D7]`, which is a primary data type.
