However, in the function `fn1`, it is being used as a 3D array of `long int`s. Since `g` is not declared as a 3D array, this is a type mismatch and will lead to a compilation error.\n\nTo fix this issue, we can modify the definition of `g` to be a 3D array of `long int`s. We can also modify the initialization of `h` to be a 2D array of `long int`s, since the program is using it as such.\n```\nlong int g[5][9][5];\nlong int h[2][2];\n```\nWith these modifications, the program should compile successfully and the type mismatch issue should be resolved.",
