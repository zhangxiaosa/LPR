Therefore, we can optimize it out by removing it from the program. Additionally, since the variable `r3` is not used, we can also optimize out the assignment `g = r3[0x06D7]`.\n\nThe resulting optimized program is the same as the original program, but with the `r3` array and the assignment to `g` removed.",

Additionally, since `h3` is a constant, we can replace it with its value `0x92A1D2CD` in the `if` statement and the assignment to `g`. This results in a shorter and more efficient program.",

The variable `h3` is never modified in the program, so it can be replaced with its initial value `0x92A1D2CD` throughout the program.\n2. The variable `r3` is never used, so it can be removed from the program.\n3. The variable `g` is only assigned to once in the program, so its value can be propagated to all uses of the variable.\n\nThe optimized program would look like this:\n```\nint g;\nint h3 = 0x92A1D2CD;\nint fn1() {\n  for (;;) {\n    g = 0xC3L;\n  }\n}\nint main() { fn1(); }\n```\nThis program has been optimized by constant propagation and copy propagation, as requested.",

Since `r3` is only used in this expression and not used anywhere else in the program, it can be optimized out by constant propagation.\n\nHere's the optimized program:\n```\nint g;\nint h3 = 0x92A1D2CD;\nint fn1() {\n  for (;;) {\n    if (h3)\n      return 0xC3L;\n    g = 0x06D7;\n  }\n}\nint main() { fn1(); }\n```\nIn this optimized program, the variable `r3` is removed and the expression `g = r3[0x06D7];` is simplified to `g = 0x06D7;`.\n\nNote that the `h3` variable is also optimized out by constant propagation, since it is always evaluated to the same value in the loop. The resulting optimized program is:\n```\nint g;\nint fn1() {\n  for (;;) {\n    g = 0x06D7;\n  }\n}\nint main() { fn1(); }\n```\nIn this final optimized program, the `h3` variable is removed and the loop is simplified to an infinite loop that assigns the value `0x06D7` to `g`.",
