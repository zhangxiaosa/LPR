These variables are of primary data types (int, long, and int) and can be used in place of the original struct h p5 parameter.\n\nTo use these variables in the fn1 function, we need to modify the function to use the new variables instead of the original struct h p5 parameter. Here is an example of how to do this:\n```\nint fn1(int p1, int p2, int p3, int p4, struct h p5) {\n  int p5_i;\n  long p5_j;\n  int p5_k;\n  p5_i = p5.i;\n  p5_j = p5.j;\n  p5_k = p5.k;\n  goto w;\n}\n```\nIn this modified version of the fn1 function, we have replaced the struct h p5 parameter with the three variables p5_i, p5_j, and p5_k. The function now uses these variables instead of the original struct h p5 parameter.\n\nNote that this is just one possible solution to the optimization problem.
