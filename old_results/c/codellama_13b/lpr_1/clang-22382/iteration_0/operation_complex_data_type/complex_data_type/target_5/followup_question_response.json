Here is the decomposed version of the struct h:\n```\nint i;\nlong j;\nint k;\n```\nThese variables are the members of the struct h, and they are the primary data types that can be optimized.\n\nThe function fn1 is a function that takes a struct h as an argument and returns a struct h. It also has a few local variables, including p1, p2, p3, and p4, which are also of type struct h.\n\nThe function fn2 is a function that takes an integer as an argument and returns an integer. It also has a few local variables, including p, q, and r, which are also of type struct h.\n\nThe main function is the entry point of the program and does not have any local variables.\n\nTo optimize the struct h, we can use the following techniques:\n\n1. Use a smaller data type: Since the struct h has only three members, we can use a smaller data type such as a 64-bit integer or a 128-bit integer to represent the struct h. This will reduce the memory usage and improve the performance of the program.\n2. Use a union: Since the struct h has only three members, we can use a union to represent the struct h. A union is a data structure that allows us to store different data types in the same memory location. This can reduce the memory usage and improve the performance of the program.\n3. Use a bitfield: Since the struct h has only three members, we can use a bitfield to represent the struct h. A bitfield is a data structure that allows us to store different data types in the same memory location. This can reduce the memory usage and improve the performance of the program.\n4. Use a compact data structure: Since the struct h has only three members, we can use a compact data structure such as an array or a list to represent the struct h. This will reduce the memory usage and improve the performance of the program.\n\nBy using these techniques, we can optimize the struct h and improve the performance of the program.",
