The optimized version of `fn1` has been replaced with a single `goto` statement, which jumps to the label `w`.

However, the compiler will try to inline small functions that are called repeatedly and that have no side effects. In this case, the function `fn1` is small and is called only once, so it is a good candidate for inlining.",

This means that the body of `fn1` has been copied and pasted into the `fn2` function, and the function call to `fn1` has been removed.\n\nThe inlining has allowed the compiler to see that the `fn1` function is only called from `fn2`, and therefore it can optimize out the function call and the code that is executed in the `fn1` function.\n\nInlining can be useful in cases where function calls are expensive, such as in embedded systems or real-time systems where every instruction counts. It can also help to improve the performance of the code by reducing the number of memory accesses and branch instructions.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that inlining can also increase the size of the code and make it more difficult to read and maintain. It's important to use inlining judiciously and only when it's necessary to improve performance.",

The function returns a `struct h` value, and the `k` field of this struct is used in the function.\n\nThe function `fn2` is defined as taking one argument `p1` and returning an `e` value. It calls `fn1` with the arguments `q`, `l`, `p1`, and `3`, and then enters an infinite loop that assigns the value of `p` to `r`.\n\nThe optimization is done by inlining the body of `fn1` into `fn2`. This is done by replacing the call to `fn1` with the body of the function, which is the sequence of statements that begins with `p5.k;` and ends with `goto w;`. This allows the compiler to eliminate the function call and eliminate the overhead associated with function calls, such as the saving and restoring of registers and the pushing and popping of the stack.\n\nAfter the optimization, the program is no longer calling the `fn1` function and is instead using the body of the function directly in `fn2`. This allows the compiler to further optimize the code by eliminating the unnecessary assignment of `p5.k` to `p5.k` and the `goto w` statement, which is a no-op.\n\nThe resulting program is the same as the original program, but with the optimization applied.",
