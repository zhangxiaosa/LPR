The function fn1 is now defined with the fifth parameter p5 as an int, since it is the only member of the struct h. The function fn2 is also modified accordingly, with the local variable p declared as an int.\n\nThe original program had a struct h with three members: i, j, and k. These members were used as parameters in the function fn1, which takes a struct h as its fifth parameter. The struct h was also used as a return type for the function fn1. In the modified program, these members have been eliminated and replaced with int.\n\nThe program has been optimized to eliminate the struct h and reduce the number of variables used. This optimization technique is called \"struct elision\" and is commonly used in C programming to reduce the overhead of structs and improve program efficiency.",
