The loop body is empty, and the loop condition is always true. Therefore, we have replaced the loop with a non-operational `goto w` statement, which will cause the program to enter an infinite loop.\n\nOverall, this optimized program is more efficient and easier to understand than the original program, because it eliminates unnecessary variables and loops.",
