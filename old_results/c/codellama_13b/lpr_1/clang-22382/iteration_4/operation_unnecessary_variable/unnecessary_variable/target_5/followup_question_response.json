Since `r` is not modified in the loop, we can replace `p` with `r` in the loop, resulting in the following optimized code:\n```\nstruct h {\n  int i;\n  long j;\n  int k;\n};\n\nstatic struct h fn1(struct h p4) {\n  while (1)\n    p4 = p4;\n}\n\nint fn2() {\n  struct h p;\n  struct h r;\n  fn1(p);\n  while (1)\n    r = r;\n}\n\nint main() {\n  // No optimizations made\n}\n```\n\nOptimization 2: Copy Propagation\n\nIn `fn2()`, the variable `p` is assigned the value of `r` in the `while` loop.

Therefore, it can be safely optimized out by the compiler.\n\nTo optimize out `p`, we can modify the `fn2()` function as follows:\n```\nint fn2() {\n  struct h p;\n  struct h r;\n  fn1(p);\n  while (1)\n    r = r;\n}\n```\nIn this modified function, the variable `p` is no longer needed and can be safely removed.
