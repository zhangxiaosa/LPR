We have also optimized out the variable `p` in `fn2()` since it is not used in the function.\n\nHere's the explanation of the optimizations:\n\n* In `fn1()`, we have optimized out the unused parameter `p2` since it is not used in the function. We have also optimized out the variable `p` since it is not used in the function.\n* In `fn2()`, we have optimized out the variable `p` since it is not used in the function.\n* In `main()`, we have optimized out the unused parameter `p1` since it is not used in the function.\n\nNote that the `while` loop in `fn1()` and `fn2()` is not optimized out since it is not clear whether the loop condition is always true or false.",

The function `fn2()` can also be simplified by removing the `p1` parameter and the `while` loop that assigns `p` to `r` and then `r` to `p`. The final optimized program would be:\n```\nstruct h {\n  int i;\n  long j;\n  int k;\n};\n\nstatic struct h fn1(struct h p4) {\n  while (1)\n    p4 = p4;\n}\n\nint fn2() {\n  struct h p;\n  struct h r;\n  fn1(p);\n  while (1)\n    p = r = p;\n}\n\nint main() {\n  // No optimizations made\n}\n```\nNote that the `p1` and `p2` parameters in `fn1()` are still present, but they are not used in the function body. This is because the function `fn1()` is called with the parameter `p` of type `struct h`, which is used in the function body. The other parameters `p1` and `p2` are not used in the function body, so they can be removed.",
