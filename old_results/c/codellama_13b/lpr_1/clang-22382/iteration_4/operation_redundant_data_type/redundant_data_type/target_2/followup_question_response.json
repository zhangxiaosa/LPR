Additionally, the \"struct h\" data type has been replaced with \"struct h\" in the while loop condition and statement.",

This is done by changing the definition of the `struct h` to use `int` instead of `long` for the `j` member. Additionally, the `fn1` function has been modified to use `int` instead of `long` for the `p4` parameter.\n\nThe optimization is done by using the fact that `long` and `int` are both 32-bit types, so the `long` data type is not needed in this program. By using `int` instead of `long`, the program becomes smaller and more efficient, which can lead to better performance.",
