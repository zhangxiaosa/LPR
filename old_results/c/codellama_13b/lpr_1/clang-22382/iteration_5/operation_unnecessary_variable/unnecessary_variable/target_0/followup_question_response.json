The variable `j` is also removed as it is not used in the `fn1` function. The variable `k` is not removed as it is used in the `fn2` function.\n\nThe constant propagation optimization is applied by replacing the value of the variable `p4` in the `fn1` function with the initial value of `p`, which is `0`. This is done by using the fact that the loop in `fn1` is an infinite loop, and the value of `p4` is never changed in the loop.\n\nThe copy propagation optimization is applied by replacing the value of the variable `p` in the `fn2` function with the value of `r`, which is also `0`. This is done by using the fact that the loop in `fn2` is an infinite loop, and the value of `p` is never changed in the loop.\n\nNote that the optimized program still has the same functionality as the original program. The optimization is done to reduce the number of variables and the number of instructions in the program, making it more efficient and easier to understand.",
