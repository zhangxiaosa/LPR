The `if` statement is also eliminated, as the compiler can see that the `goto` instruction will always jump to `i` if `e` is true.\n\nThe optimized program is equivalent to the original program, but with less code and fewer instructions.",

This means that the function `fn1()` has been replaced by its body directly in the calling function `main()`. This is done by removing the recursion and replacing it with a direct call to the function `fn1()`.\n\nIn the original program, the function `fn1()` had a recursive call to itself. This recursive call was in an `if` statement, which caused the function to call itself repeatedly. However, in the optimized program, the recursive call has been removed, and the function has been simplified to a single return statement.\n\nThe optimization is done by function inlining, which is a technique used to reduce the overhead of function calls by directly embedding the function's body into the calling function. This technique is particularly useful when the function is called many times in a program, as it reduces the overhead of the function call and improves the performance of the program.",
