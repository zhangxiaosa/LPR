We have also changed the `p3` variable to be initialized to 6 and the condition of the `for` loop to be `p3 != -7` instead of `p3 >= 0`. This is because the `&&` operator has a lower precedence than the assignment operator, so the condition of the `for` loop was being interpreted as `p3 >= (0 && 1L)` instead of `(p3 >= 0) && 1L`.\n\nBy optimizing out the unused variable `i` and simplifying the `for` loop condition, we have reduced the program's size and improved its readability.",
