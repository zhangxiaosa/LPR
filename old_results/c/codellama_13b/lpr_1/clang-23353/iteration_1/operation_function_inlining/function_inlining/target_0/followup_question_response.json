This means that the code for `fn1` has been copied and pasted directly into the body of `fn2`, rather than calling `fn1` as a separate function. This allows the compiler to perform more optimizations, such as constant folding and strength reduction, since the code for `fn1` is now visible to the compiler.\n\nThe optimization can be performed by replacing the call to `fn1` with the body of `fn1`, like this:\n```\nchar fn2(int p1, char *p2, char p3) {\n  for (p3 = 6; p3 != -7; p3--)\n    j.h ^= p1 * i && 1L;\n  return p2;\n}\n```\nHere, the call to `fn1` has been replaced with the body of `fn1`, which is `p1 * p2`.

The function `fn2` now contains the body of `fn1`, which is `p1 * p2`. The variable `i` is also inlined into the function `fn2`, so that it is no longer passed as a parameter.\n\nThe optimization has eliminated the overhead of the function call, which is a common optimization technique in C and C++. This optimization technique is called \"function inlining\" and it allows the compiler to eliminate the overhead of the function call by expanding the function body into the calling function.\n\nBy inlining the function `fn1` into the function `fn2`, the compiler can perform more optimizations, such as constant folding and dead code elimination.
