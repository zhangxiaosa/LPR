The variable `i` is not used in the program, so it can be optimized out.\n2. Since `i` is not used, its value can be replaced with 0 in the call to `fn1`.\n3. The loop in `fn2` can be simplified by removing the unnecessary condition `p3 != -7`, since it is not used.\n\nAfter these optimizations, the program becomes shorter and more efficient.",

This optimization is called \"constant propagation\".\n\nAlternatively, if we want to optimize out `i` by copy propagation, we can modify the `fn2` function as follows:\n```\nchar fn1(char p1, char p2) { return p1 * p2; }\nchar *fn2(int p1, char *p2, char p3) {\n  for (p3 = 6; p3 != -7; p3--)\n    j ^= fn1(p3, ' ') && 1L;\n  return p2;\n}\nint main() { return 0; }\n```\nIn this version, the `i` variable has been replaced with the character literal `' '` in the `fn1` function.

The `fn1` function also has a redundant multiplication operation, which is optimized out by constant propagation. The `fn2` function has a local variable `j` that is used to perform the XOR operation, but it is not used anywhere else in the program, so it is optimized out. Finally, the `main` function is not changed.",
