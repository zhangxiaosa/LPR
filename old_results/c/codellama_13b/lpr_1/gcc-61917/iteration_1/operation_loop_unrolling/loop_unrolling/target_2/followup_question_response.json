This has resulted in a significant reduction in the number of iterations required to complete the loop, which in turn has improved the performance of the program.",

The `while` loop is written in a way that it evaluates the condition `k >= -27` at the end of each iteration, which allows us to eliminate the need for a separate conditional statement in the loop body. Additionally, the loop body has been simplified by removing the loop variable assignment `k = fn1(k, 6)` and replacing it with a single statement `p1 = k - p1`.",
