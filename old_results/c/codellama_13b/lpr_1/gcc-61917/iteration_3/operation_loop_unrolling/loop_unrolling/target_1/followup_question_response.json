The second part of the loop, which is the while loop that iterates while `k` is greater than or equal to -27, has been replaced with a sequence of instructions that perform the same functionality. The third part of the loop, which is the incrementing of `p1` by 2 and the decrementing of `p1` by 5, has been replaced with a single instruction that performs the same functionality. Finally, the fourth part of the loop, which is the incrementing of `p1` by 1, has been moved outside of the loop.\n\nThe optimized version of the program should be functionally equivalent to the original program, but should execute faster because it avoids the overhead of the loop.",
