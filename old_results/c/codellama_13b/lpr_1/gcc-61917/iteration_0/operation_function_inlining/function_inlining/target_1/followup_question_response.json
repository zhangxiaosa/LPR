This results in a smaller and more efficient program, as there is no need to make a function call.\n\nNote that this optimization is only applicable in this specific case, where the `fn2` function is called with constant arguments. In more general cases, the function call cannot be inlined, and the program will need to be optimized in different ways.",

It's recommended to use inlining only when the function is small and the call is not a performance bottleneck.",

The function `fn2` has been inlined into the function `fn3` to eliminate the function call overhead.\n2. The `p2` parameter of `fn2` has been replaced with the value `o` in the function `fn3`, which is a constant value equal to 0x4FL.\n3. The `k` variable in the function `fn3` has been replaced with a constant value equal to -27.\n\nThe optimized program now has the following functions:\n\n1. `fn1`: This function has not been modified.\n2. `fn3`: This function has been modified to eliminate the function call overhead and to replace the `k` variable with a constant value.\n3. `main`: This function has not been modified.\n\nThe optimized program should be faster and more efficient than the original program, as it eliminates the function call overhead and replaces the `k` variable with a constant value.",
