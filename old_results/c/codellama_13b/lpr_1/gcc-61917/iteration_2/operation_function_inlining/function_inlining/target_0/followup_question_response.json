This optimization is called \"function inlining\".\n\nThe resulting program is shorter and more efficient because it eliminates the overhead of function calls, which can be significant for small functions like `fn1`. Additionally, the inlining of `fn1` allows the compiler to perform more aggressive optimizations, such as constant folding and dead code elimination, which can further improve the performance of the program.",
