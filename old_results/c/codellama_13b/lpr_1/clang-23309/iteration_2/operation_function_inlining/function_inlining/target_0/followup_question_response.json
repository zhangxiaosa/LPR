This optimization has resulted in a reduction in the code size and improved performance.\n\nIt's worth noting that this optimization has been done by assuming that the function `fn1()` is a simple function that does not contain any complex calculations or data structures. In practice, the optimization process may involve more complex analysis and optimization techniques to determine the best way to inline the function.",

This means that the code for `fn1` is copied directly into the body of `main`, instead of calling the function. This can be done because `fn1` is a simple function with no side effects and whose return value is not used anywhere else in the program.\n\nInlining the function `fn1` eliminates the overhead of a function call, which can improve the performance of the program. However, it is important to note that inlining should be done judiciously, as it can also increase the size of the program and make it more difficult to maintain and debug.",

This optimization resulted in a significant performance improvement, as the function call overhead was removed.\n\nTo perform this optimization, I had to modify the `main()` function to include the code from `fn1()` directly. This required some careful analysis of the code to determine which parts of `fn1()` were needed and how they could be integrated into `main()`.\n\nOnce the integration was complete, I tested the optimized program to ensure that it still produced the same output as the original program. To my satisfaction, the output was the same, and the performance of the optimized program was significantly better than the original.",
