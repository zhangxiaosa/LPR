This eliminates the overhead of a function call and allows the compiler to optimize the code further.\n2. The `fn6` function was removed from the program entirely, since it is no longer needed.\n3. The `f` type was removed from the program, since it is no longer used.\n4. The `b` type was removed from the program, since it is no longer used.\n5. The `an` variable was removed from the program, since it is no longer used.\n6. The `fn10` and `fn11` functions were removed from the program, since they are no longer used.\n7. The `ac` variable was removed from the program, since it is no longer used.\n8. The `fn13` function was modified to use the inlined `fn6` function, since it is no longer needed to call the `fn6` function.\n\nAfter these changes, the program is optimized and runs more efficiently.",
