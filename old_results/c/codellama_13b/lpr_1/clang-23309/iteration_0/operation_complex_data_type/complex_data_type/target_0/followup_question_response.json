To optimize the array, we can first simplify the data types by decomposing them into simpler types.\n\nHere is the decomposition of the data types into simpler types:\n\n* `f` can be decomposed into `unsigned int`.\n* `g` can be decomposed into `unsigned long`.\n* `short` can be decomposed into `unsigned short`.\n* `unsigned` can be decomposed into `unsigned int`.\n* `d` can be decomposed into `unsigned char`.\n\nOnce the data types have been decomposed, we can analyze the program to identify the array that needs to be optimized. The array in this case is `u`, which is of type `unsigned int`.\n\nTo optimize the array, we can use the following techniques:\n\n1. Use a smaller data type: Instead of using `unsigned int`, we can use `unsigned short` to store the array elements. This will reduce the memory usage and improve the performance.\n2. Use a more efficient algorithm: Instead of using a linear search algorithm, we can use a binary search algorithm to search for the array elements. This will improve the performance of the program.\n3. Use caching: We can use caching to store frequently accessed array elements in a cache memory.

In this case, the arrays are \"p\", \"ab\", \"ac\", \"an\", and \"w\".\n2. Next, determine the size of the arrays. In this case, the size of \"p\" and \"ab\" is not specified, but the size of \"ac\", \"an\", and \"w\" is determined by the loop conditions.\n3. Optimize the arrays by using the largest data type that can fit the size of the array. For example, since \"ac\" and \"an\" are used as indices in the loop, they can be optimized to use a 64-bit data type (long or unsigned long) instead of a 32-bit data type (int). Similarly, \"w\" can be optimized to use a 32-bit data type (int) instead of a 16-bit data type (short).\n4. Finally, optimize the program by reducing the number of array accesses. For example, in the \"fn13\" function, the \"an\" array is accessed multiple times. Instead of accessing the array each time, you can store the values in a temporary variable and use the temporary variable instead.
