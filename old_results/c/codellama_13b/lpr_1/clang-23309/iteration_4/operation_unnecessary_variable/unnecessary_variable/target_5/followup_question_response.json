Copy Propagation:\n\nThe variable `ao` is assigned the value `0xBCD1` in the first `if` statement. Since this value is never changed, it can be propagated to the second `if` statement, which can then be simplified to:\n```\nif (w == 3) {\n  short p2 = fn6(ab, ac) || (w == 0x294A85636008822D);\n  if (fn3(0xBCD1, fn6(1, w)) - p2 & 1)\n    v = 1;\n}\n```\n3.
