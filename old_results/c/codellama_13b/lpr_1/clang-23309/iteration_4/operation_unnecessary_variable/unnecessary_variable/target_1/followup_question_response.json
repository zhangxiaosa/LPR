Constant Propagation:\n\nIn the function `fn13()`, the variable `an` is initialized to `250` and then used in the `if` statement. However, the value of `an` is never changed, so it can be optimized out and the `if` statement can be simplified to:\n```\nif (w = 3) {\n  ...\n}\n```\n2. Copy Propagation:\n\nIn the function `fn13()`, the variable `ao` is initialized to `0xBCD1` and then used in the expression `fn3(ao, fn6(1, an)) - p2 & 1`. However, the value of `ao` is never changed, so it can be optimized out and the expression can be simplified to:\n```\nif (fn3(0xBCD1, fn6(1, an)) - p2 & 1) {\n  v = 1;\n}\n```\n3. Dead Code Elimination:\n\nIn the function `fn13()`, the variable `p2` is initialized to `fn6(ab, ac) || (an = w) == 0x294A85636008822D` and then used in the expression `fn3(ao, fn6(1, an)) - p2 & 1`.
