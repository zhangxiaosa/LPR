This was done by moving the body of the `fn6()` function directly into the `fn13()` function, and replacing all calls to `fn6()` with the inlined code.\n\nThe resulting code is shorter and faster, as it eliminates the overhead of function calls. Additionally, the inlining allows the compiler to perform more optimizations, such as constant folding and dead code elimination.\n\nNote that the `fn6(short, short)` function is still defined in the program, but it is not called from any other function. This is because the inlining has eliminated the need for the function call.",

The `fn6(ab, ac) || (an = w) == 0x294A85636008822D` expression has also been simplified by moving the `an = w` assignment to the `if` statement. This allows the `fn6(ab, ac)` function to be called only once, instead of twice as in the original program. Additionally, the `fn3(ao, fn6(1, an)) - p2 & 1` expression has been simplified by eliminating the `fn6(1, an)` function call, which is no longer needed.",

This has eliminated the function call and the overhead associated with it. The function `fn6(short, short)` has also been simplified to simply return the difference between its two parameters.\n\nThe optimization has been done by replacing the function call with the function body, and then simplifying the body to remove any unnecessary steps. The resulting code is more concise and efficient.\n\nPlease note that this is just one possible optimization, and there may be other ways to optimize the program as well. The optimization process should be repeated until no further optimizations can be made.",

This optimization has also eliminated the need for the `fn6` function entirely, since its body was simply being called from another function.\n\nAdditionally, the `fn13` function has been optimized to eliminate the `if` statement that was checking the return value of `fn6`. This was done by changing the `if` statement to a simple assignment, since the `if` statement was only checking whether the return value of `fn6` was non-zero.\n\nLastly, the `fn13` function has been optimized to eliminate the `for` loop that was iterating over the `w` variable. This was done by changing the `for` loop to a simple `while` loop, since the `for` loop was only iterating over the `w` variable and didn't need to use the `w` variable in the loop body.\n\nOverall, this optimized program has resulted in a significant reduction in the number of function calls and a more efficient use of memory, which should result in improved performance.",
