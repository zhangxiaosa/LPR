This has resulted in a significant reduction in the number of function calls and has improved the performance of the program.\n\nIt's worth noting that the `fn3` and `fn6` functions are still called from within the `fn13` function, but since the `fn9` function is no longer called from `main`, the overhead of the function call is eliminated.\n\nThe `main` function is also simplified by removing the call to `fn9` and instead printing the checksum directly.
