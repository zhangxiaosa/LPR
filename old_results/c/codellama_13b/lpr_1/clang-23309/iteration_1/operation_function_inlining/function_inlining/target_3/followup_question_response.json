The function has a large number of nested loops and conditionals, which makes it difficult to analyze and optimize.\n3. The function has a large number of local variables, which makes it difficult to optimize.\n\nTo optimize this function, we can try to simplify it by breaking it down into smaller functions and inlining the smaller functions.
