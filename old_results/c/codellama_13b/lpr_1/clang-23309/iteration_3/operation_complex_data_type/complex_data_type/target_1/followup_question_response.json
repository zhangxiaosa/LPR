Replace the `ac` variable with `ac_low` and `ac_high` variables in the `fn6` and `fn3` functions.\n2. Replace the `ac` variable with `ac_low` and `ac_high` variables in the `fn13` function.\n3.

The `&` operator is used to mask off the lower 16 bits of `ac`, which effectively divides the value by 2^16.\n\nAlso, note that the `int` type is used for the two new variables `ac_high` and `ac_low` because it is the most appropriate type for the given operation.
