The inlined version of the function is:\n```\nshort fn6(short p1, short p2) {\n  return p1 - p2;\n}\n```\nThis is a simple function, so it can be inlined into the `fn12` function without affecting the performance of the program. The inlined version of the `fn12` function is:\n```\nshort fn12(short p1, short p2, short p3, short p4, short p5) {\n  long an;\n  for (w = 3; w; w -= 1)\n    if (an = 250UL) {\n      p2 = p1 - ac || (an = w) == 0x294A85636008822DLL;\n      short ao = 0xBCD1L;\n      if (fn2(fn3(ao, fn4(1UL, an), 0xECL), p2) & 1UL)\n        v = 1UL;\n    }\n  return 3L;\n}\n```\nAs you can see, the `fn6` function has been inlined into the `fn12` function, and the `fn6` function call has been replaced with the actual operation. This optimization has reduced the number of function calls and the overhead associated with function calls, which can improve the performance of the program.",

The function `fn6` has been inlined into the loop condition, and the function `fn4` has been inlined into the argument of `fn3`. This has allowed for some constant folding and propagation, which has resulted in fewer instructions and less overhead.\n\nIt's worth noting that this optimization is not guaranteed to always improve performance, and it may not always be possible to inline a function that is called many times.
