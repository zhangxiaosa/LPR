Therefore, it has been removed from the program completely. The function `fn9` has also been modified to pass a dummy value `0` as the first argument instead of `v`, as `v` is not used in this function.\n\nThe resulting program is shorter, simpler, and more efficient, and can be compiled and run without any issues.",
