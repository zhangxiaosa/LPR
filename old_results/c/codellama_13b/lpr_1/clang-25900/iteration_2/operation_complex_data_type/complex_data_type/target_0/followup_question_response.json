Reduce the size of the `ad` variable by removing unnecessary data. In this case, we can remove the `o_prime` field, since it is not used in the program.\n2. Use more efficient data types. Since the `ad` variable contains two fields, we can use a single `int` data type to represent both fields.\n3. Reduce the number of operations. Since the `ad` variable is used in the `fn3` function, we can optimize the function by reducing the number of operations.\n\nHere is the optimized program:\n```\nint fn1(int p1, int p2) {\n  return p2;\n}\n\nstruct m {\n  int n;\n};\n\nint r;\nstatic int s = -5L;\nint t;\nint v;\n\nint fn3(q) {\n  struct m ad = {1957};\n  r = t % (~s / ad.n);\n}\n\nint main() {\n  fn3(0);\n}\n```\nIn this optimized program, we have removed the `o_prime` field from the `ad` variable, since it is not used in the program.
