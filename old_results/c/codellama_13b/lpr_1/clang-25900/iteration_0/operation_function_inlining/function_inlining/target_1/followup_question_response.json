The function `fn3` is called with the parameter `p5` and its return value is ignored. The return value of `fn2` is `p1`, which is the first parameter of the function. This optimization is done by inlining the function `fn3` within `fn2`. This reduces the number of function calls and allows the compiler to optimize the code further.",
