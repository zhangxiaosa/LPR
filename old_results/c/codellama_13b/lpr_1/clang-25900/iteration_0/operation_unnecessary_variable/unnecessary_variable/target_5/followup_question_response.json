This will simplify the program and reduce the number of instructions.\n2. Copy Propagation:\nThe variable `ae` in `fn3` is assigned the value of `ad.o`, which is a field of a struct. Since `ad` is a local variable, and `ad.o` is the only reference to it, we can propagate the value of `ad.o` throughout the program and replace all references to `ae` with `ad.o`.
