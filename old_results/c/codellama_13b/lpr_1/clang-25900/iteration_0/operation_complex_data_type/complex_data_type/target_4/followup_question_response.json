If we convert it to an `unsigned` integer, we can avoid the potential negative value and optimize the program.\n```\nint fn1(int p1, int p2) { return p2; }\n\nstruct k {\n  unsigned l;\n};\n\nstruct m {\n  signed n : 18;\n  signed o : 1;\n};\n\nint r;\nstatic unsigned s = -5L;\nunsigned t;\nint u;\nunsigned v;\n\nint fn3(int p1) {\n  struct m ad = {1957};\n  ad.o = fn1(v, 5);\n  signed ae;\n  int af = t;\n  ae = ad.o;\n  ad.o = u;\n  r = af % (~s / ae);\n  ad.o;\n}\n\nint main() {\n  int q_l = 0;\n  fn3(q_l);\n}\n```\n2. **Removing the negation**: The `s` variable is currently used in the calculation of `af % (~s / ae)`. If we remove the negation operator (`~`), the program may run faster.\n```\nint fn1(int p1, int p2) { return p2; }\n\nstruct k {\n  unsigned l;\n};\n\nstruct m {\n  signed n : 18;\n  signed o : 1;\n};\n\nint r;\nstatic unsigned s = -5L;\nunsigned t;\nint u;\nunsigned v;\n\nint fn3(int p1) {\n  struct m ad = {1957};\n  ad.o = fn1(v, 5);\n  signed ae;\n  int af = t;\n  ae = ad.o;\n  ad.o = u;\n  r = af % (s / ae);\n  ad.o;\n}\n\nint main() {\n  int q_l = 0;\n  fn3(q_l);\n}\n```\n3. **Reducing the precision**: The `s` variable is currently defined as a `signed` integer with a precision of 18 bits. If we reduce the precision to 16 bits, the program may run faster.\n```\nint fn1(int p1, int p2) { return p2; }\n\nstruct k {\n  unsigned l;\n};\n\nstruct m {\n  signed n : 16;\n  signed o : 1;\n};\n\nint r;\nstatic unsigned s = -5L;\nunsigned t;\nint u;\nunsigned v;\n\nint fn3(int p1) {\n  struct m ad = {1957};\n  ad.o = fn1(v, 5);\n  signed ae;\n  int af = t;\n  ae = ad.o;\n  ad.o = u;\n  r = af % (~s / ae);\n  ad.o;\n}\n\nint main() {\n  int q_l = 0;\n  fn3(q_l);\n}\n```\n4. **Replace the modulo operation**: The `af % (~s / ae)` calculation is currently performed using the modulo operator (`%`). If we replace this operation with a bitwise AND (`&`) operation, the program may run faster.\n```\nint fn1(int p1, int p2) { return p2; }\n\nstruct k {\n  unsigned l;\n};\n\nstruct m {\n  signed n : 16;\n  signed o : 1;\n};\n\nint r;\nstatic unsigned s = -5L;\nunsigned t;\nint u;\nunsigned v;\n\nint fn3(int p1) {\n  struct m ad = {1957};\n  ad.o = fn1(v, 5);\n  signed ae;\n  int af = t;\n  ae = ad.o;\n  ad.o = u;\n  r = af & (~s / ae);\n  ad.o;\n}\n\nint main() {\n  int q_l = 0;\n  fn3(q_l);\n}\n```\n5. **Inlining the function**: The `fn1` function is currently called from within the `fn3` function. If we inline the `fn1` function, the program may run faster.\n```\nint fn1(int p1, int p2) { return p2; }\n\nstruct k {\n  unsigned l;\n};\n\nstruct m {\n  signed n : 16;\n  signed o : 1;\n};\n\nint r;\nstatic unsigned s = -5L;\nunsigned t;\nint u;\nunsigned v;\n\nint fn3(int p1) {\n  struct m ad = {1957};\n  signed ae;\n  int af = t;\n  ae = ad.o;\n  ad.o = u;\n  r = af & (~s / ae);\n  ad.o;\n}\n\nint main() {\n  int q_l = 0;\n  fn3(q_l);\n}\n```\nIt is important to note that the optimization techniques above may not necessarily result in the best performance for all cases, and the best approach may depend on the specific hardware and software environment in which the program is being executed. Therefore, it is important to thoroughly analyze the program and test the different optimization techniques to determine the most effective approach.",
