This is because `c` is a typedef for `int`, so it is redundant to use it in the program. By replacing it with `int`, we can make the code more readable and easier to understand.\n\nNote that we have also replaced `unsigned` with `signed` in the struct `m`, since `unsigned` is not a valid data type in C.",
