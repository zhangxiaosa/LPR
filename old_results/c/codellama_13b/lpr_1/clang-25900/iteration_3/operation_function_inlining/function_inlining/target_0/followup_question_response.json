This has resulted in a reduction in the number of function calls and a slight increase in the size of the program, but it has resulted in a faster execution time because the function call overhead has been eliminated.\n\nNote that the inlining optimization is only applicable in this specific case because the `fn1` function is very simple and has no side effects. In general, inlining should be used sparingly and only when the benefits outweigh the costs.",

This has eliminated the overhead of function calls and resulted in a more optimized code.\n\nNote that the `fn1` function is still present in the program, but it is not called from anywhere, and its definition has been removed.

This means that the code for `fn1` has been copied directly into the `fn3` function, eliminating the need for a function call. This optimization can improve the performance of the program by reducing the overhead associated with function calls.\n\nTo inline the `fn1` function, we first need to find the call to `fn1` in `fn3`. In this case, the call is on line 12 of `fn3`:\n```\nad.o_prime = fn1(5, 5);\n```\nNext, we need to copy the code for `fn1` into `fn3`. In this case, the code for `fn1` is simple and can be copied directly:\n```\nad.o_prime = 5;\n```\nFinally, we need to remove the call to `fn1` from `fn3` and replace it with the inlined code. This is done on line 12 of `fn3`:\n```\nad.o_prime = 5;\n```\nThe resulting optimized version of the program has the same functionality as the original program, but with the `fn1` function inlined into the `fn3` function.",
