The `n` variable is an `int` variable that stores the value of `1957`, and the `o_prime` variable is an `int` variable that stores the result of the `fn1` function. The `r` variable is also changed to be an `int` variable.\n\nThe `fn3` function is also modified to use the new variables instead of the `m` struct.
