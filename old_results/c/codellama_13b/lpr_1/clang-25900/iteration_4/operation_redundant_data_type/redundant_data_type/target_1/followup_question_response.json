This optimization is possible because the `struct m` data type is not used anywhere else in the program, so there is no need to define it as a separate data type.\n\nAdditionally, we have optimized the `fn1` function by replacing its body with a simple return statement. This optimization is possible because the `fn1` function is only called once, and its return value is not used anywhere else in the program.\n\nOverall, this optimization has reduced the size of the program and made it faster to execute.",

Finally, we have removed the line `ad.o_prime_2` since it is not needed and it does not affect the functionality of the program.\n\nNote that the optimized program may have different behavior than the original program if the `struct` type had any side effects or if the function `fn1` had any side effects.
