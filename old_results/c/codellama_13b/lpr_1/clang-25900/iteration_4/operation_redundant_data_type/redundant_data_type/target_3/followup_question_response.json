This optimization is valid because the value of `s` is never changed in the program, so it can be initialized to a constant value.\n\nNote that the `L` suffix on the value `-5L` is not necessary, as the constant value is already of type `int`.",

The function `fn1` can be called with the argument `5` directly, without the need for a temporary variable. The variable `ad` can be declared as an `int` instead of a `struct`. The variable `s` can be declared as a `static int` instead of a `static long`.\n\nThe optimized program has the same functionality as the original program, but with less code and a more efficient use of data types.",

The `struct m` has been replaced with an `int` variable `ad`.\n\nThe optimized program has the same functionality as the original program, but it is simpler and more efficient. The `struct m` has been eliminated, and the program has been reduced to a single `int` variable `ad`.
