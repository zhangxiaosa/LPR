This means that the function call to `fn1` is replaced by the body of the function `fn1`. In this case, the function `fn1` takes a single argument `p2` and returns `p2`. Therefore, the function call `fn1(5)` is replaced by `5`.\n\nThe resulting optimized program is equivalent to the original program, but with the function `fn1` inlined, which can potentially improve performance.",

This has eliminated the function call and the redundancy of storing the result in a temporary variable `ae`.\n\nNote that inlining the function `fn1()` has not changed the semantics of the program, as the function only returns its input argument, and the result is used as an immediate value in the expression `t % (~s / ae)`.\n\nAlso, note that the inlined function `fn1()` is no longer defined in the program, as it is not used anywhere else.",

This means that the call to `fn1()` has been replaced with the actual implementation of the function, which is to return the value of `p2`.\n\nBy inlining the function, we have reduced the number of function calls and the amount of code that needs to be executed. This can result in improved performance and reduced memory usage.\n\nNote that inlining can also have other benefits, such as reducing the number of memory accesses and improving cache coherency. However, these benefits depend on the specific circumstances and the target system. In this case, the optimization is based on the assumption that the target system has a large number of function calls and a limited number of registers, and that the function `fn1()` is small enough to be inlined without increasing the code size too much.",
