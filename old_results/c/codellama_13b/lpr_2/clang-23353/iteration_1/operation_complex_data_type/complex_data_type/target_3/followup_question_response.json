The variable `j` has been decomposed into two separate variables `j1` and `j2`. The variable `j1` is used to store the result of the bitwise XOR operation and the variable `j2` is used to store the result of the logical AND operation. This allows the program to use only primary data types and avoids the use of complex data types such as `char`.",

The variable `i` is also used in the function `fn1` and is used as a parameter.\n\nTo optimize the performance of the program, we can try to reduce the number of times that `j` is used in the function `fn2`. One way to do this is to move the initialization of `j` to outside of the while loop, so that it is only initialized once instead of every iteration of the loop. This can be done by adding the following line of code before the while loop:\n```\nj = 0;\n```\nThis will initialize `j` to 0 and then use it as the accumulator in the while loop.\n\nAnother optimization that can be done is to remove the call to `fn1` from the loop. Since `fn1` takes two parameters and returns a value, it can be computed outside of the loop and stored in a variable. This can be done by adding the following line of code before the while loop:\n```\nint result = fn1(n, i);\n```\nThis will compute the result of `fn1(n, i)` and store it in the variable `result`. Then, in the while loop, we can replace the call to `fn1` with the variable `result`. This will reduce the number of times that `fn1` is called and can improve the performance of the program.\n\nThe modified program with the optimizations applied is:\n```\nint i;\nint j;\nint n;\nint p1;\nint p2;\n\nchar fn1(char p1, char p2) { return p1 * p2; }\n\nint fn2(int p1) {\n  int n = 6;\n  j = 0;\n  int result = fn1(n, i);\n  while (n != -7) {\n    j ^= result && 1L;\n    n--;\n  }\n  return j;\n}\n\nint main() { return 0; }\n```\nThis modified program should have better performance than the original program, with fewer calls to `fn1` and fewer writes to the variable `j`.",
