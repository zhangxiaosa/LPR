Additionally, the data type `struct g` is not used, so it can also be eliminated. The program can be simplified as follows:\n```\ntypedef unsigned int c;\nchar fn1(char p1, char p2) { return p1 * p2; }\nint i;\nint j;\nint *fn2(unsigned int p1, int *p2, char p3) {\n  for (p3 = 6; p3 != -7; p3--)\n    j ^= fn1(p3, i) && 1L;\n  return p2;\n}\nint main() { return 0; }\n```\nNote that the `struct g` has been replaced with a simple integer variable `j`.",

The `&&` operator in the `fn2` function returns a `bool` value, which is a `signed int` on some platforms.
