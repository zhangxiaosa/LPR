Since `l` is a local variable that is not used outside of the `fn1` function, we can replace all references to `l` with the constant value `{24, 6738, 165}`. This will eliminate the need for the variable `l` and simplify the code.\n\nHere is the optimized code:\n```\nint i_g;\nint j_e;\nint j_h;\nint fn1() {\n  int n = j_h && {24, 6738, 165}.d;\n  unsigned o = {24, 6738, 165}.d;\n  i_g = o | -(24, 6738, 165).f && {24, 6738, 165}.d - n;\n}\nint main() {}\n```\n\nAlternatively, we can use copy propagation to eliminate the variable `l`.
