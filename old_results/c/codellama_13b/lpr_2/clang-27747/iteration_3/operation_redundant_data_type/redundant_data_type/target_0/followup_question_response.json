The `short` data type has been eliminated and replaced with `int` in all instances. The struct `c` has also been modified to use `int` for its member variables instead of `short`.\n\nThe main function has not been modified, but the `j_e` variable has been changed to an `int` type. The `i_g` and `m` variables have also been changed to `int` types.\n\nThe `l` variable has been declared as a `struct` and initialized with the values 24, 6738, and 165. The `d` member variable of `l` has been assigned the value of `j_e`, which is of type `int`. The `m` variable has been assigned the value of `j_e && l.d`, which is of type `int`. The `i_g` variable has been assigned the value of `l.d | -(l.f && l.d) - m`, which is also of type `int`.\n\nOverall, this program has been optimized to use only the `int` data type, as requested.",
