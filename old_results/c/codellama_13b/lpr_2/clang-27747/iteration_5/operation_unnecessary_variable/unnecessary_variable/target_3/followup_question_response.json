Constant propagation:\nThe variable `j` is not used in the program, so we can replace all occurrences of `j` with its initial value (which is 0).\n2. Copy propagation:\nThe variable `l.d` is initialized to the value 24, so we can replace all occurrences of `l.d` with its initial value.\n\nTherefore, the optimized program is:\n```\nint main() {\n  struct {\n    int d : 18;\n    int f;\n  } l = {24, 165};\n  l.d = 24;\n  m = 24 && 24;\n  i = 24 | -(l.f && 24) - m;\n}\n```\nSince the variable `j` is not used in the program, we can safely remove it.

This is because the variable `j` is not used in the program, and its value is not relevant to the computation.\n\nBy using constant propagation or copy propagation, we can eliminate the variable `j` and simplify the program. Since the variable `j` is not used, we can simply replace it with 0 and the program will still produce the same output.\n\nThis optimization is done by the compiler during the optimization phase of the compilation process. The goal of this optimization is to reduce the size of the generated code and improve the performance of the program by eliminating unnecessary variables and computations.",

Therefore, the expression `m = j && l.d;` becomes `m = 0;`.\n\nThe expression `i = l.d | -(l.f && l.d) - m;` is also simplified, as `-(l.f && l.d)` is equal to `-(0 && 0)` which is equal to `0`. Therefore, the expression becomes `i = l.d | 0 - 0;` which is simply `i = l.d;`.\n\nSo, the optimized program is:\n```\nint i;\nint m;\nint main() {\n  struct {\n    int d : 18;\n    int f;\n  } l = {24, 165};\n  l.d = 0;\n  m = 0;\n  i = l.d;\n}\n```",
