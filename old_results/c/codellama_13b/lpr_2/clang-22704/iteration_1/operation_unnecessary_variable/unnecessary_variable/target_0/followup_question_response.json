Therefore, we can optimize out the variable and replace it with `true`.\n* The `goto` statement is also optimized out, since the `if` statement is always true.\n* The function `fn1()` is called recursively, but the recursive call is optimized out since the `if` statement is always true.\n* The variable `j` is also optimized out since it is not used in the optimized code.\n\nAfter optimization, the program becomes:\n```\nlong fn1() {\n  true = 6L;\n  fn1();\n  return 0xEEACFBBFL;\n}\nint main() {}\n```\nThis program is equivalent to the original program, but with the variable `d` and the `goto` statement optimized out.",

The variable \"d\" is unused, so I've optimized it out.\n\nIn the original program, the variable \"d\" is a global variable that is not used in any of the functions in the program. Therefore, it can be optimized out without affecting the behavior of the program.\n\nBy using constant propagation, we can see that the value of \"d\" is always set to 6L in the \"i\" label. This means that we can replace all uses of \"d\" with 6L throughout the program, since it is a constant value.\n\nBy using copy propagation, we can see that the value of \"d\" is always used in the \"i\" label, so we can replace all uses of \"d\" with 6L throughout the program, since it is a constant value.\n\nOverall, the optimized program is smaller and faster than the original program, since it eliminates unnecessary variable and function calls.",
