This change results in smaller memory usage and faster execution time for the program.\n\nIt is important to note that this optimization is only possible if the variable `j` is not used in any arithmetic operations that require a long integer.

The function first checks if `j` is equal to `0`, and if so, returns the value `0xEEACFBBFL`. Otherwise, it calls itself with `j - 1` as the argument, and returns the result of that call.\n\nThe optimized version is more efficient than the original version because it avoids an infinite loop by checking if `j` is equal to `0` before entering the loop. Additionally, it avoids the creation of an unnecessary variable `i` and the use of the `goto` statement.",
