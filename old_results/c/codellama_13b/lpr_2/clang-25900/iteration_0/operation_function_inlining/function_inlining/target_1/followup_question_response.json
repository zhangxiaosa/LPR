This means that the code of `fn2` has been copied directly into the body of `fn4`, instead of being called as a separate function. This can improve the performance of the program, as it eliminates the overhead of function calls. However, it can also make the program more difficult to read and maintain, as the code of `fn2` is now duplicated in multiple places.",

The optimization is done by replacing the function call to `fn2` with the body of the function, which is the function `fn3`.\n\nThe resulting program no longer has the function `fn2`, and the function `fn3` is now a nested function inside the `main` function. The `fn3` function is also fully inlined into the `main` function, which means that the function `fn1` is also inlined into the `main` function.\n\nThe resulting program is more efficient and faster than the original program, with reduced memory usage and improved performance.",

Therefore, it is not possible to optimize `fn2` out by inlining it into `fn4`.\n\nHowever, if you want to optimize the program by inlining `fn1` into `fn3`, you can do so by changing the definition of `fn3` as follows:\n```\nb fn3(g p1) {\n  struct m ad = {1957};\n  ad.o = 5;\n  a ae;\n  c af = t;\n  ae = ad.o;\n  ad.o = u;\n  r = af % (~s / ae);\n  ad.o;\n}\n```\nThis will allow the compiler to inline the call to `fn1` into `fn3`, eliminating the overhead of the function call and reducing the size of the executable.\n\nNote that this optimization is only recommended if the inlined function is small and has no side effects. If the inlined function has side effects or is large, it may not be worth the trade-off in terms of code size and complexity.",

The `p` parameter of `fn2` has been removed, as it is not used in the function. The `p5` parameter of `fn3` has been removed, as it is not used in the function.
