The expression `5 % (5 / ae)` can be simplified to `5 % 5`, which is always equal to 0, so the assignment to `r` can be eliminated as well. The final optimized program becomes:\n```\nint fn1(int p1, int p2) {\n  return p2;\n}\n\nint main() {\n  struct m ad = {1957};\n  ad.o = 5;\n}\n```",

Therefore, the program can be optimized to:\n```\nint fn1(int p1, int p2) {\n  return p2;\n}\n\nint r;\n\nstruct m {\n  int n : 18;\n  int o : 1;\n};\n\nint main() {\n  struct m ad = {1957};\n  ad.o = 5;\n  int ae = 5;\n  r = 5 % (5 / ae);\n  ad.o;\n}\n```\nAdditionally, as `r` is not used in the program, it can be optimized out completely, resulting in the final optimized program:\n```\nint fn1(int p1, int p2) {\n  return p2;\n}\n\nstruct m {\n  int n : 18;\n  int o : 1;\n};\n\nint main() {\n  struct m ad = {1957};\n  ad.o = 5;\n  int ae = 5;\n}\n```",
