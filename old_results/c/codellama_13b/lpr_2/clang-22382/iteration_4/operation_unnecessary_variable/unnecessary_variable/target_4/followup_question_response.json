Constant Propagation: The variable `p` is only used in `fn1()`, which is a while loop that does not modify `p`. Therefore, `p` can be considered as a constant in the context of `fn2()`.\n2. Copy Propagation: The variable `r` is only used to assign the value of `p` to it. Since `r` is not used anywhere else, the assignment can be replaced with `p`.\n\nTherefore, the optimized program does not have any references to `p`.",

The `fn1(p)` function call in `fn2()` has also been optimized out, since it is not used. The `fn2()` function has been simplified to a `while` loop that assigns `p` to `r` and then discards `r`. The `main()` function has been simplified to a `while` loop that assigns `p` to `r` and then discards `r`.\n\nThis optimization is known as \"dead code elimination\" or \"code pruning\". It is a simple and effective way to reduce the size and complexity of a program, and can improve its performance by reducing the number of instructions that need to be executed.",
