Constant propagation:\nThe variable `p` is initialized with a struct of type `h` in `fn1`, and then it is never modified. Since it is not modified, the value of `p` is constant throughout the function, and can be propagated to the callers of `fn1`.\n2. Copy propagation:\nThe variable `r` is initialized with a struct of type `h` in the while loop. The assignment `p = r = p` is equivalent to `r.i = p.i; r.j = p.j; r.k = p.k; p.i = r.i; p.j = r.j; p.k = r.k;`, which is a copy of the struct `p` to `r` and then `r` to `p`. Since `p` is already a copy of `r`, this assignment can be optimized out.\n\nTherefore, the optimized program has the same behavior as the original program, but with less code and fewer variables.",
