We have also removed the `fn1` function since it is not used in the program.\n\nThe `struct h` definition now only contains the `k` variable, which is used in the `fn2` function. The `fn2` function has also been modified to use the `k` variable instead of the `i` and `j` variables.\n\nThe `main` function is still empty since it is not used in the program.",

The only variable that is used is `k`, which is kept in the `struct h` definition.\n\nNote that the `goto w;` statement in the `fn1` function is an infinite loop that will cause the program to crash.

These variables are not used in the program and can be optimized out.\n\nTo optimize out these variables, we can modify the `struct h` definition as follows:\n```\nstruct h {\n  int k;\n};\n```\nThis will remove the unused variables `i` and `j` from the `struct h` definition.\n\nAdditionally, the `fn1` function also has an unused variable `p`. This variable is not used in the function and can be optimized out.\n```\nstatic struct h fn1(struct h p) {\n  p.k;\nw:;\n  goto w;\n}\n```\nThis can be modified to the following:\n```\nstatic struct h fn1(void) {\n  w:;\n  goto w;\n}\n```\nThis will remove the unused variable `p` from the `fn1` function.\n\nFinally, the `fn2` function also has an unused variable `p`.
