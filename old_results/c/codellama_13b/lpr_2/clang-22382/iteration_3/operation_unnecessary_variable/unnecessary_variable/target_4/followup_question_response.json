This optimization can be achieved through various techniques such as constant propagation and copy propagation.\n\nConstant propagation involves evaluating the value of a variable at compile-time and replacing it with the constant value. In this case, since the `k` field is not used in the program, it can be safely removed.\n\nCopy propagation involves replacing a variable with its initial value at the point of definition. In this case, the `p` variable is initialized with a `struct h` object, and it is never modified, so it can be safely replaced with the initial value, `struct h`.\n\nOverall, these optimizations can help to reduce the memory usage and improve the performance of the program by eliminating unused variables and reducing the number of instructions.",
