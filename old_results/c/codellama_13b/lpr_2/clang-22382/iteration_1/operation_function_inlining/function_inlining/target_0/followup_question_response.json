This has removed the function call and the need for a function stack frame, which can improve performance. Additionally, we have removed the `goto` statement and the associated label, as they are not needed in this context.\n\nThe optimized program is functionally equivalent to the original program, but it is more efficient and easier to read.",

The function `fn1` has been replaced by the body of the function, which now appears directly in the `fn2` function. This allows the program to avoid the overhead of a function call, which can be slower than executing the code directly.\n\nIn addition, the loop in `fn2` has been optimized by using a `while` loop instead of a `for` loop. This is a common optimization technique in C programming, as it can help to reduce the number of instructions executed and improve performance.\n\nOverall, this optimized program is more efficient and faster than the original program, due to the use of function inlining and loop optimization.",

The `fn1` function is called with the same arguments as the `fn2` function, so the function can be inlined directly without any changes.\n\nThe `main` function is also modified to call `fn1` directly instead of calling `fn2` and then inlining `fn1`.

This is done by replacing the call to `fn1` with the body of the function.\n\nThe `fn1` function is declared as `static`, so it is only visible within the current compilation unit (i.e., the current source file). Since the function is not exported, it is not necessary to preserve the function name and parameters.\n\nThe `fn1` function takes five parameters: `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `p4`, and `p5`. However, only `p5` is used within the function. Therefore, the other parameters can be removed.\n\nThe `fn1` function has a `goto` statement that jumps back to the beginning of the function. This is an infinite loop, so it can be replaced with a `while` loop that never terminates.\n\nThe `fn1` function also has a statement that reads the value of `p5.k`. However, this value is not used within the function, so it can be removed.\n\nThe `fn2` function is not modified in this optimization. It still calls `fn1` with the same parameters and returns the same value.\n\nThe optimized program is functionally equivalent to the original program, but it is more efficient and has less code.",
