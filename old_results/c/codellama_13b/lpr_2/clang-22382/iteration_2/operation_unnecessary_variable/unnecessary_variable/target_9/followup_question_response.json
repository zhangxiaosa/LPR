Since `p` is not used in `fn2()`, it can be optimized out.\n\nTherefore, the optimized version of the program is:\n```\nstruct h {\n  int i;\n  long j;\n  int k;\n};\n\nstatic struct h fn1(struct h p) {\n  p.k;\nw:;\n  goto w;\n}\n\nunsigned fn2() {\n  struct h r;\n  for (;;) {\n    r = r;\n  }\n}\n\nint main() {}\n```\nNote that the `fn2()` function still has an infinite loop, but it does not have any side effects, so it is safe to optimize it out.",

Constant Propagation:\n\nIn the function `fn1`, the variable `p` is used only to access the field `k`. Since `p` is not modified in the function, it can be considered as a constant. Therefore, the expression `p.k` can be optimized by propagating the value of `k` directly, eliminating the need for the unnecessary memory access.\n\nBefore:\n```c\nstruct h p;\n...\np.k;\n```\nAfter:\n```c\nk;\n```\nAfter applying these optimizations, the modified program will be:\n```c\nstruct h {\n  int i;\n  long j;\n  int k;\n};\n\nstatic struct h fn1(struct h p) {\n  k;\nw:;\n  goto w;\n}\n\nunsigned fn2() {\n  struct h r = p;\n  for (;;) {\n    struct h r = p;\n  }\n}\n\nint main() {}\n```",
