In the `fn2` function, the `p` variable is unused and can be optimized out.\n4. The `for` loop in `fn2` is an infinite loop and can be optimized out.\n\nTherefore, the optimized program becomes:\n```\nstruct h {\n  int i;\n  int k;\n};\n\nstatic struct h fn1(unsigned p1, int p2, struct h p5) {\n  p5.k;\nw:;\n  goto w;\n}\n\nunsigned fn2(p1) {\n  struct h p;\n  fn1(3, 3, p);\n}\n\nint main() {}\n```\nNote that the `j` field is not optimized out as it is still used in the `struct h` definition.",

The `fn2` function has also been modified to only take the `p1` parameter, and the `main` function has been modified to create a `struct h` with a `k` field set to 0 and then call `fn1` and `fn2` with a `p1` parameter set to 3.\n\nThe constant propagation optimization has been applied to the `j` field in the `struct h` to remove it from the program. The `j` field was not used anywhere in the program, so it was safe to remove it.\n\nThe copy propagation optimization has been applied to the `p` and `r` variables in the `fn2` function. The `p` variable was only used to call `fn1` with a `p5` parameter set to `p`, so it was safe to remove it and replace all uses of it with `p5`.
