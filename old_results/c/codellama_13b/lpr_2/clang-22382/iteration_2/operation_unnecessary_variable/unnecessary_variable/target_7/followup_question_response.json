This is because the statement `goto w` does not have any effect in the function and it is not necessary to jump to the label.\n\nThe function `fn2` is also optimized out by removing the `for` loop. The loop does not have any side effects and it is not necessary to execute it.\n\nThe `main` function is also optimized out by removing it.
