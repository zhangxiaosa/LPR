This will eliminate the need for the `struct h` definition and reduce the size of the program.\n\nHere is the optimized program:\n```\nint fn1(unsigned p1, int p2, int p5) {\n  p5.k;\n  goto w;\n}\n\nunsigned fn2(p1) {\n  int p;\n  fn1(3, 3, p);\n  for (;;) {\n    int r;\n    p = r = p;\n  }\n}\n\nint main() {}\n```\nThis optimized program is smaller and more efficient, as it eliminates the need for the `struct h` definition and replaces it with a simpler data type.",
