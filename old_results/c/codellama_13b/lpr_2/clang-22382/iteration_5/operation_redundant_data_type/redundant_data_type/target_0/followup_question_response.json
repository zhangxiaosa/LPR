This is done in the `struct h` definition, where the member `i` is now a `long` instead of an `int`. Additionally, the `fn1` function definition is unchanged because it does not use the `int` data type. Finally, the `fn2` function definition is also unchanged because it does not use the `int` data type.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.",

The function `fn1` has also been modified to take and return an int type instead of a struct type. Additionally, the `p` variable in the `fn2` function has been changed to an int type.\n\nThis optimization can be useful in situations where the struct data type is not needed, or where the use of the struct data type is not necessary for the program's functionality.",

Define a new data type `struct int` that contains three `int` variables `i`, `j`, and `k`.\n2. Replace all occurrences of `struct h` with `struct int` in the function definitions and function calls.\n3.
