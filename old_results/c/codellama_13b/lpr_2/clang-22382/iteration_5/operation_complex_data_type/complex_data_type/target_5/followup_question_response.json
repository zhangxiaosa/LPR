The function `fn1` accesses the `k` field of the `p` parameter.\n\nTo optimize the program, we can decompose the `struct h` variable into smaller variables with primary data types. For example:\n```\nstruct h {\n  long i;\n  int j;\n  long k;\n};\n\nstatic struct h fn1(struct h p) {\n  while (1)\n    p.k;\n}\n\nunsigned fn2() {\n  long i;\n  int j;\n  long k;\n  struct h p;\n  fn1(p);\n  while (1) {\n    long i;\n    int j;\n    long k;\n    p = i, j, k;\n  }\n}\n\nint main() {}\n```\nIn this new version of the program, we have split the `struct h` variable into three separate variables: `i`, `j`, and `k`. These variables are used to store the values of the `i`, `j`, and `k` fields of the `struct h` variable, respectively.\n\nThe function `fn1` is now called with the parameter `p`, which is a `long` variable. The function `fn2` is also modified to call `fn1` with the parameter `p`, which is a `long` variable.\n\nThis new version of the program optimizes the program by reducing the size of the `struct h` variable and by storing the values of the `i`, `j`, and `k` fields of the `struct h` variable in separate variables. This can improve the performance of the program by reducing the amount of memory required to store the `struct h` variable.",
