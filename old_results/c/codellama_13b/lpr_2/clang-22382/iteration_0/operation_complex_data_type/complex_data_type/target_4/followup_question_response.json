For example, to access the value of the first member of struct h, you can use the variable i_1. To access the value of the second member of struct h, you can use the variable j_1. To access the value of the third member of struct h, you can use the variable k_1.\n\nIt's important to note that the struct h is still present in the program, but it is not used directly.

It contains three integer variables: `i`, `j`, and `k`.\n\nTo decompose this variable into primary data types, we can extract the individual variables and create a new struct to represent the decomposed data. Here's an example of how we can do this:\n```\nstruct h_decomposed {\n  int i;\n  long j;\n  int k;\n};\n\nstruct h_decomposed fn1(unsigned p1, short p2, unsigned p3, unsigned p4,\n                    struct h_decomposed p5) {\n  p5.k;\nw:;\n  goto w;\n}\n\nunsigned fn2(p1) {\n  struct h_decomposed p;\n  int q;\n  fn1(q, l, p1, 3, p);\n  while (1) {\n    struct h_decomposed r;\n    p = r = p;\n  }\n}\n\nint main() {}\n```\nIn this example, we have created a new struct called `struct h_decomposed` that contains the individual variables `i`, `j`, and `k`. We have also modified the function `fn1` and `fn2` to use this new struct instead of the original `struct h`.\n\nThis approach allows us to break down the complex data type `struct h` into its individual components, which can make the program easier to understand and modify.",
