The optimized program is as follows:\n```\nint main() {\n  fn13();\n  printf(\"checksum = %X\\n\", v);\n  return 0;\n}\n```\nIn this optimized version, the variable `t` is no longer declared or used anywhere in the program. The function call to `fn13()` is still present, but the result of the function call is not stored in any variable. Instead, the result is directly passed as an argument to the `printf()` function.\n\nThe constant propagation optimization was performed by simplifying the expressions involving the variables `v` and `an` in the `fn12()` function. For example, the expression `fn2(fn3(0xBCD1L, fn4(fn6(1L, an), 0xECL)), p2) & 1UL` was simplified to `fn2(fn3(0xBCD1L, 1UL), p2) & 1UL` because the value of `an` is a constant and can be evaluated at compile time.\n\nThe copy propagation optimization was performed by replacing the variable `p2` with its value in the expression `p2 = fn5(p2, ac) || (an = w) == 0x294A85636008822DLL`. This optimization was done because the value of `p2` is not changed after it is assigned, so it can be replaced with its value in the expression.\n\nOverall, the optimized program should run faster and use less memory because it eliminates the unnecessary variable `t` and performs constant folding and copy propagation.",
