The function `fn10` has also been optimized out, as it is not called from anywhere in the program.\n\nThe function `fn12` has been simplified to remove the unnecessary variable `an`. The `if` statement in the `for` loop has been modified to use `fn3` and `fn4` directly, without calling `fn6`.\n\nThe function `main` has been simplified to use `fn13` and `p` directly, without calling `fn12`.\n\nThe resulting program is more efficient and easier to understand, as it has reduced the number of variables and functions used.",

This has resulted in the elimination of the variables `ac` and `an`, as well as the constant values `250UL` and `0x294A85636008822DLL`.\n\nThe copy propagation optimization has been applied to the program by replacing the variable `p2` with its value in the loop. This has resulted in the elimination of the variable `p2`, as it is no longer needed.\n\nThe program now only uses the variables `w`, `v`, and `p`, and the constant value `3L`.
