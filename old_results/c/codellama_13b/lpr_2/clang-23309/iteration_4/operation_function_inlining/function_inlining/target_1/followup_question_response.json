This means that the body of the `fn2` function has been copied and pasted into the `fn12` function, and the `fn2` function has been removed.\n\nThe resulting program is the same as the original program, but with the `fn2` function inlined into `fn12`. This can result in better performance, as there is no longer a function call overhead. However, it can also make the code more difficult to read and understand, as the code is now more complex and has more branches.",

The function `fn2` is called with the arguments `p1` and `p2` and the result is used in the `if` statement. The function `fn2` is now eliminated and its body is executed directly in the `fn12` function.\n\nThis optimization can significantly reduce the number of instructions and improve the performance of the program.",

This has resulted in a small performance improvement, as the cost of the function call has been eliminated.\n\nNote that the optimization was made by inlining only the `fn2` function, and not the entire `fn12` function. This is because inlining the entire function would have resulted in a larger code size, which may not have been desirable in this case. The optimized code has been kept as compact as possible while still achieving the desired performance improvement.",

This expression is the same as the body of the `fn2` function, but with the parameters `p1` and `p2` replaced with the appropriate values.\n\nThe optimized version of the program can be compiled and run using the same commands as before:\n```\n$ gcc -O3 -o program program.c\n$ ./program\nchecksum = 1\n```\nAs before, the program prints the checksum value `1` to the console.",
