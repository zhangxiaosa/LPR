This is done by changing the function signatures and the variable declarations to use `unsigned short` instead of `unsigned`.\n\nFor example, the function `fn2` is now declared as:\n```\nunsigned short fn2(unsigned short p1, unsigned short p2) { return p1 - p2; }\n```\nAnd the variable `w` is declared as:\n```\nunsigned short w;\n```\nSimilarly, the function `fn12` is declared as:\n```\nunsigned short fn12(unsigned short p1, unsigned short p2, unsigned short p3,\n                    unsigned short p4) {\n```\nAnd the variable `an` is declared as:\n```\nunsigned short an = 250UL;\n```\nBy using `unsigned short` instead of `unsigned`, we can avoid the overhead of checking the sign bit of the `unsigned` values, which is not necessary since we are only working with positive values.

This change was made to optimize the program for the target platform, which is assumed to be a platform that supports 16-bit unsigned integers.\n\nIt's worth noting that the program is still using a lot of bitwise operations, which can be computationally expensive and may not be optimal for the target platform. Additionally, the program is using a lot of constants that are not necessarily platform-specific, so it may be worth considering optimizing those as well.",
