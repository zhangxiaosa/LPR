The `p2` parameter of the `fn6()` function call is then used in the `fn2()` function call.\n\nSince the value of `an` is constant throughout the execution of the `fn12()` function, it can be optimized out by constant propagation. The resulting optimized code would be:\n```\nunsigned short fn12(unsigned short p1, unsigned short p2, unsigned short p3,\n                    unsigned short p4) {\n  for (w = 3; w; w -= 1) {\n    p2 = fn5(p2, p4) || (250UL) == 0x294A85636008822DLL;\n    if (fn2(fn3(0xBCD1L, fn4(fn6(1L, 250UL), 0xECL)), p2) & 1UL)\n      return 1UL;\n  }\n  return 3L;\n}\n```\nIn this optimized code, the `an` variable has been replaced with the constant value `250UL` throughout the execution of the `fn12()` function.",
