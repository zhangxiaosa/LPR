This allows the compiler to remove the function call overhead and improve performance.\n\nThe `fn13` function has also been optimized by removing the function call to `fn12`, as it is no longer needed.

The `fn4` function was removed from the program entirely, and its functionality was replaced with the `fn12` function.\n\nThe `fn4` function was inlined into the `fn12` function because it was used only once in the program, and inlining it made the program more efficient. The inlined function is now part of the `fn12` function, and the `fn4` function has been removed from the program.\n\nThe `fn12` function is now responsible for both the original functionality of the `fn4` function and the original functionality of the `fn12` function. This is known as \"function hoisting\" and it is a common technique used in compiler optimization to improve the performance of a program.\n\nThe optimized program is now smaller and more efficient, and it should produce the same output as the original program.",
