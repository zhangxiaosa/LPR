Simplify the logic: The function `fn11` has a lot of nested if-else statements and other complex logic, which can make it difficult to understand and optimize. We can simplify the logic by using a single if-else statement and eliminating unnecessary variables.\n2. Remove redundant operations: The function `fn11` performs a number of redundant operations, such as computing `fn6(am, an)` and then using it in the if-else statement. We can remove these redundant operations to simplify the function and make it more efficient.\n3. Use bitwise operations: The function `fn11` performs a number of bitwise operations, such as `&` and `|`. These operations can be replaced with bitwise and arithmetic operations, which can make the function more efficient.\n4. Use a lookup table: The function `fn11` has a lot of repetitive code, which can make it difficult to maintain and optimize. We can use a lookup table to store the results of the function for different input values, which can help to reduce the number of computations required.\n\nHere is the optimized version of the function `fn11`:\n```c\nshort fn11(d p1, f p2, b p3, short p4) {\n  c ai = 7L;\n  short aj = 1UL;\n  short an = 250UL;\n  short al = 3L;\n  c am = 1L;\n  if (an == w) {\n    p2 = fn5(ab, ac) || (an = w) == 0x294A85636008822DLL;\n    short ao = 0xBCD1L;\n    if (fn2(fn3(ao, fn4(fn6(am, an), 0xECL)), p2) & 1UL)\n      v = 1UL;\n  }\n  return al;\n}\n```\nIn this optimized version of the function, we have simplified the logic by using a single if-else statement and eliminating unnecessary variables.

The `if-else` statements in the `fn12` function could be improved by using a more efficient data structure, such as a hash table or a binary search tree, to reduce the time complexity of the algorithm.\n2. The `fn12` function performs a series of bitwise operations, which could be improved by using bitwise operations that are more efficient and can be optimized by the compiler.\n3. The `fn12` function uses the `||` operator to combine two conditions, which could be improved by using a more efficient way to combine conditions, such as by using a single `if` statement with multiple conditions.\n\nTo optimize the `fn11` function, we can use the following techniques:\n\n1.
