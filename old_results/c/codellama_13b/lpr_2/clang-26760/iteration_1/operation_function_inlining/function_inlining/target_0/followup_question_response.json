An infinite loop that decrements `j` until it reaches 0.\n2. An infinite loop that shifts `j` to the right by one bit and then shifts it back to the left by the same number of bits.\n\nThe optimization that can be applied is inlining the definition of `fn1` into `main`. This can be done by replacing the call to `fn1` with the definition of `fn1` in `main`.\n\nHere is the optimized program:\n```\nint f;\nint main() {\n  unsigned j = 0x24F96B7BL;\n  for (f = 0; f;)\n    for (; j; --j)\n      ;\n  int m = j;\nq:;\n  j = j >> 1L;\n  j = j << m;\n  goto q;\n}\n```\nThis optimization removes the overhead of a function call and reduces the number of instructions.",
