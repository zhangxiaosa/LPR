The variable `m` is initialized to 0.\n\nThe loop in the `fn1()` function is optimized by moving the initialization of `j` and `m` out of the loop. This allows the loop to be executed more efficiently.\n\nThe `goto` statement is also optimized by replacing it with a `break` statement. This allows the loop to exit more cleanly and avoids the use of `goto` which is considered bad practice.\n\nThe optimized program is more readable and easier to maintain compared to the original program.",
