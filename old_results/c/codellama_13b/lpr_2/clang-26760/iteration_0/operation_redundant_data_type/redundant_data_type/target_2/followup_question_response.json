This is because the data type `int` is unnecessary and can be replaced with `unsigned long` without affecting the functionality of the program.\n\nHere is the explanation for each step:\n\n1. The line `int f;` is removed because it is not used in the program.\n2. The line `int g;` is removed because it is not used in the program.\n3. The line `unsigned long j = 0x24F96B7BL;` is replaced with `unsigned long j;` because the initial value is not used and can be removed.\n4. The line `unsigned k;` is replaced with `unsigned long k;` because the data type `unsigned` can be replaced with `unsigned long` without affecting the functionality of the program.\n5. The line `int l = 1L;` is replaced with `int l;` because the initial value is not used and can be removed.\n6. The line `int m = j;` is replaced with `unsigned long m = j;` because the data type `int` can be replaced with `unsigned long` without affecting the functionality of the program.\n7. The line `int n = g;` is replaced with `unsigned long n = g;` because the data type `int` can be replaced with `unsigned long` without affecting the functionality of the program.\n8. The line `int o = n;` is replaced with `unsigned long o = n;` because the data type `int` can be replaced with `unsigned long` without affecting the functionality of the program.\n9. The line `unsigned p = o;` is replaced with `unsigned long p = o;` because the data type `unsigned` can be replaced with `unsigned long` without affecting the functionality of the program.\n10. The line `k = k >> l;` is replaced with `k = k >> l;` because the data type `int` can be replaced with `unsigned long` without affecting the functionality of the program.\n11. The line `i = p;` is replaced with `i = p;` because the data type `int` can be replaced with `unsigned long` without affecting the functionality of the program.\n12. The line `if (i) {` is replaced with `if (i) {` because the data type `int` can be replaced with `unsigned long` without affecting the functionality of the program.\n\nThe optimized version of the program is now:\n```\nint fn1() {\n  int i;\n  unsigned long j;\n  unsigned long k;\n  for (; j; --j)\n    ;\n  int l;\n  unsigned long m = j;\n  unsigned long n = g;\n  unsigned long o = n;\n  unsigned long p = o;\nq:;\n  k = k >> l;\n  i = p;\n  if (i) {\n    k = k << m;\n    goto q;\n  }\n}\nint main() {}\n```\nThis version of the program has been optimized to use the data type `unsigned long` instead of `int` wherever possible, without affecting the functionality of the program.",
