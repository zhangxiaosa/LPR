This allows the compiler to eliminate the function call and replace it with the constant value `0x92A1D2CDL`, which is the value of `h2` at compile-time.

This allows the compiler to eliminate the global variable and simplify the program.\n\nNote that this optimization is only possible if the value of `h2` is known at compile-time.

This means that the value of `h2` is no longer stored in a separate memory location, but is instead hardcoded directly into the function. This can help to improve performance by reducing the number of memory accesses required to access `h2`.\n\nAdditionally, the array `r` has been initialized with the value `0x06D7L`, which is the same value used to index into the array. This helps to eliminate the need for the array to be initialized every time the function is called.\n\nOverall, this optimized program should result in improved performance compared to the original program.",
