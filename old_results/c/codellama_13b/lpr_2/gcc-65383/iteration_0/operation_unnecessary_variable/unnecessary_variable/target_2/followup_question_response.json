The if statement has been modified to compare h2 with the constant value 0x92A1D2CDL instead of the variable h2. This optimization is done to eliminate the use of the variable h2 and replace it with the constant value.\n\nPlease note that this optimization is only possible when the value of h2 is known at compile time and is not modified during the program's execution.\n\nAlso, this optimization is only valid for the specific case of h2 being used as a condition in the if statement. If h2 is used in any other way, this optimization would not be possible.\n\nIt is also worth noting that this optimization is not always the most efficient way to optimize the code. In some cases, it may be more efficient to use other optimization techniques, such as loop unrolling or instruction reordering. However, for this specific case, constant propagation is a valid and efficient optimization technique.",
