It is not a primary data type, but rather a composite data type.\n\nThe program can be optimized by inlining the function `fn2` into `main`, as it is only called once and has no side effects. This can help reduce the overhead of function calls and improve performance.\n\nHere is the optimized program:\n```\nint main() {\n  unsigned long r[5][9][5];\n  int g;\n  unsigned long h0 = 0x92A1D2CDL;\n  unsigned long h1 = 0x92A1D2CDL;\n  unsigned long h2 = 0x92A1D2CDL;\n  static int i = 0x06D7L;\n  int q;\n\n  for (;;) {\n    if (h2)\n      return q;\n    g = r[i][i][i];\n  }\n}\n```\nThis optimized program is now a single function that inlines the `fn2` function. It does not have any function calls and is therefore faster and more efficient.",
