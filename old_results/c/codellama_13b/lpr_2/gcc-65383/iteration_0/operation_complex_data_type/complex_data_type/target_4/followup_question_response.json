The variable `h` is no longer an array of complex data type, but rather a collection of three individual variables with simpler data types. This should make it easier to optimize the program by avoiding the need to perform complex data type operations.",

This means that each element of `h` is an integer, but the data type of the entire array is not an integer.\n\nAlso, the data type of `r` is a 3D array of unsigned integers, but it is never used in the program.

The variable `i` is also decomposed into a primary data type, and the variable `q` is left as-is since it is not used in the optimization.\n\nThe `fn2()` function is modified to use the decomposed variables instead of the original `h` variable. The `for` loop is also modified to use the decomposed variables instead of the original `h` variable.\n\nNote that the program still has the same behavior as the original program, but the optimization is now possible by decomposing the `h` variable into multiple variables.",
