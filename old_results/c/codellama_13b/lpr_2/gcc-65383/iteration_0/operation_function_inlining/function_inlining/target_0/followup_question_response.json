This means that the body of `fn1` has been replaced with the code of `fn1` directly in `fn2`, without the need for a separate function call.\n\nThe reason for inlining `fn1` is to improve the performance of the program by reducing the overhead of function calls. Inlining allows the compiler to generate more efficient code by eliminating the overhead of function calls and allowing the code to be executed directly in the calling function.\n\nIn this case, the inlined code of `fn1` is only a few instructions, so the overhead of the function call is minimal. However, in more complex functions, the overhead of the function call can be significant, and inlining can help to improve performance.",
