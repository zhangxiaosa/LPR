This allows the compiler to inline the function call and eliminates the overhead associated with the array access.",

Instead of calling the function, we have directly accessed the array elements. This has resulted in a faster execution time as we have avoided the function call overhead.\n\nNote that this optimization is only applicable if the `r` array is a local variable and is not used anywhere else in the program. If the `r` array is a global variable or is used in other parts of the program, we cannot inline it.",

This can be done by defining a function `get_r()` that returns the value of `g` and then calling that function instead of accessing the `r` array.\n\nHere is the modified program with function inlining:\n```\nint g;\nunsigned h2 = 0x92A1D2CDL;\nint main() {\n  for (;;) {\n    if (h2) {\n      return g;\n    }\n    g = get_r();\n  }\n}\n\nunsigned get_r() {\n  return g;\n}\n```\nIn this modified program, the `get_r()` function is defined to return the value of `g`, and the `r` array is replaced with a call to the `get_r()` function. This replaces the array access with a function call, which can potentially be optimized further by the compiler.\n\nNote that this is just one possible way to optimize the program by function inlining.

However, if you still want to inline the functions, you can do so by replacing the function call with the function body.\n\nFor example, you can replace the line `g = r[0x06D7L][0x06D7L][0x06D7L];` with the function body of the `r` function.\n\nHere is the optimized version of the program with function inlining:\n```\nint g;\nunsigned h2 = 0x92A1D2CDL;\nint main() {\n  for (;;) {\n    unsigned r[5][9][5];\n    if (h2) {\n      return g;\n    }\n    g = r[0x06D7L][0x06D7L][0x06D7L];\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNote that this is just one possible optimization that can be done on the program.
