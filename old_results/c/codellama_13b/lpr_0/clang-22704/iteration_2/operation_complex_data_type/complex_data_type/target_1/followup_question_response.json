This is done by assigning `f_e` to each of these variables in the `if` statement and the `goto` statement.\n\nNote that this is just one way to decompose the variable into primary data types. There may be other ways to do this, and the specific decomposition will depend on the context of the program and the goals of the optimization.",

The program can be safely optimized without any changes to the variable names or types.\n\nHowever, if you still want to decompose the variables into primary data types, you can do so by replacing the complex data types with their corresponding primary data types. For example, the variable `f_e` can be replaced with an `int` variable.\n```\nint f_e;\nint fn1() {\n  if (f_e)\n    goto i;\n  fn1();\n  return 0xEEACFBBF;\ni:\n  f_e = 6;\n  fn1();\n  return 0xEEACFBBF;\n}\nint main() {}\n```\nThis modified program uses only primary data types and does not have any pointers.",

The program uses the `goto` statement to jump to the `i` label if the `f_e` flag is set, and then it calls the `fn1` function recursively. The `fn1` function returns a value of 0xEEACFBBF, and then it sets the `f_e` flag to 6 and calls itself recursively again. The `main` function returns 0.",
