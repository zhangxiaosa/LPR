We have also optimized out the recursive call to `fn1()` by using copy propagation.\n\nThe constant propagation was done by replacing the `if` statement with its constant value. The `if` statement was replaced with `if (!f_e)` because `f_e` is an integer and it can only have two values: 0 and 1. Since `f_e` is not equal to 0, the `if` statement is always true and the `goto` statement is never executed. Therefore, the `if` statement can be replaced with `if (!f_e)`.\n\nThe copy propagation was done by replacing the recursive call to `fn1()` with its return value. Since `fn1()` always returns the same value, the recursive call can be replaced with its return value. This optimization eliminates the recursive call and reduces the size of the program.\n\nThe resulting optimized program is smaller and more efficient than the original program.",
