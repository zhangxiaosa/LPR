In this case, the only complex data type is the `fn1()` function, which returns an integer.\n\nNext, we need to decompose the `fn1()` function into variables with primary data type. We can do this by replacing the function call with the body of the function, and replacing the return statement with a variable assignment.\n\nHere's the modified program with the variables decomposed:\n```\nint f_d;\nint f_e;\n\nint fn1_body() {\n  if (f_e)\n    goto i;\n  fn1_body();\n  return 0xEEACFBBF;\ni:\n  f_d = 6;\n  fn1_body();\n  return 0xEEACFBBF;\n}\n\nint main() {}\n```\nNow, we can see that the `fn1_body()` function has a single variable `f_d` that is of type `int`. This is the variable that we need to optimize.\n\nTo optimize the program, we can use the following techniques:\n\n1. Constant folding: Since `f_e` is a constant, we can replace `if (f_e)` with `if (1)` and eliminate the `goto i` statement.\n2. Dead code elimination: Since `f_d` is only assigned a value in the `i` label, we can eliminate the code that is executed when `f_e` is not true.\n3. Tail recursion optimization: Since the recursive call to `fn1_body()` is the last statement in the function, we can replace it with a loop and eliminate the recursive call.\n\nHere's the optimized program:\n```\nint f_d;\nint f_e;\n\nint fn1_body() {\n  if (1) {\n    f_d = 6;\n    while (1) {\n      fn1_body();\n    }\n  }\n  return 0xEEACFBBF;\n}\n\nint main() {}\n```\nThis optimized program eliminates the unnecessary code and improves the performance of the program.",
