This is an example of constant propagation.\n\nFinally, we have removed the `fn1(g)` call from the `fn2()` function, as it is not necessary to call the function with a parameter that is not used within the function.\n\nI hope this helps!

Here is the optimized version of the program with the target variables removed:\n```\nint e;\nunsigned g;\nunsigned h2 = 0x92A1D2CDL;\nint fn1(unsigned m) {\n  for (;;) {\n    if (h2)\n      return 0xC3L;\n    g = 0x06D7L;\n  }\n}\nvoid fn2() { fn1(g); }\nint main() { fn2(); }\n```\nThe variables `m`, `n`, `o`, and `p` are unused in the `fn1()` function, so they can be safely removed. Additionally, the `r` array is not used anywhere in the program, so it can be removed as well.\n\nAfter removing the unused variables and the `r` array, the program can be further optimized by constant propagation and copy propagation. For example, the `h2` variable is never updated, so its value can be propagated throughout the program. Similarly, the `g` variable is always assigned the value `0x06D7L`, so its value can be propagated throughout the program.\n\nHere is the optimized version of the program with constant propagation and copy propagation applied:\n```\nint e;\nunsigned g = 0x06D7L;\nunsigned h2 = 0x92A1D2CDL;\nint fn1() {\n  if (h2)\n    return 0xC3L;\n  return g;\n}\nvoid fn2() { fn1(); }\nint main() { fn2(); }\n```\nIn this optimized version of the program, the `m` variable is no longer needed since it is not used anywhere in the program. Additionally, the `fn1()` function no longer takes any arguments since the `g` variable is always the same value.\n\nOverall, the optimized program is smaller, faster, and more efficient than the original program.",
