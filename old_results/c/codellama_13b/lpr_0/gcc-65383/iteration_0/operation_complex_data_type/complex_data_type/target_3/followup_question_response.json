However, it is optimized for the input variables `m`, `n`, `o`, and `p`, which are of type `int`.\n\nTo further optimize the function `fn1`, we need to analyze the complexity of the function and identify the bottlenecks. Based on the given program, it is not possible to provide further optimization suggestions as the complexity of the function is not clear. However, we can suggest that you use a profiling tool to analyze the complexity of the function and identify the bottlenecks.",
