This is done to ensure that the loop condition `k >= -27` is evaluated correctly and efficiently. The use of `unsigned` data type for `k` may lead to a potential overflow issue, which could result in incorrect or unexpected behavior.\nAlso, note that the `volatile` keyword is used to declare `m` as a `volatile` variable. This is done because the array `m` is modified in the function `fn3`, and the changes made to `m` must be visible to the rest of the program.",
