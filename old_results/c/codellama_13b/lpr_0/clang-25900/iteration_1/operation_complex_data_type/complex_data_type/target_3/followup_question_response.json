This can be done by creating a new variable `int n` and initializing it with the value of `ad.n` in the `main` function.\n\nHere is the modified program:\n```\nint fn1(int p1, int p2) {\n  return p2;\n}\n\nstruct m {\n  int o : 1;\n};\n\nint r;\nstatic int s = -5L;\nunsigned t;\nint u;\n\nint main() {\n  struct m ad = {1957};\n  ad.o = fn1(t, 5);\n  int ae;\n  int af = t;\n  ae = ad.o;\n  ad.o = u;\n  int n = ad.n;\n  r = af % (~s / ae);\n  ad.o;\n}\n```\nBy doing this, the program will be optimized for the target variable `n` by changing it from being a member of a complex data type to a simple variable with the primary data type `int`.

Since the target variable to be optimized is `n`, we can extract the value of `n` from `ad` and use it as a separate variable.\n\nHere is the optimized program:\n```\nstruct m {\n  int n;\n  int o;\n};\n\nint r;\nstatic int s = -5L;\nunsigned t;\nint u;\n\nint main() {\n  struct m ad = {1957};\n  int n = ad.n;\n  ad.o = fn1(t, 5);\n  int ae;\n  int af = t;\n  ae = ad.o;\n  ad.o = u;\n  r = af % (~s / ae);\n  ad.o;\n}\n```\nIn this optimized program, the `n` member of the `ad` struct is extracted and used as a separate variable. This allows the compiler to optimize the accesses to the `n` member by avoiding the need to access the `ad` struct.\n\nNote that the `ad.o` member is still accessed in the program, but it is not the target variable to be optimized. Therefore, it is not necessary to extract it as a separate variable.",
