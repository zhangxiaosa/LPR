Since the type of `s` is `int`, we can decompose it into two variables with primary data types:\n\n* `s1`: An `int` variable that stores the value of `s` in the current scope.\n* `s2`: An `int` variable that stores the value of `s` in the previous scope.\n\nThe program can be optimized by removing the `static` keyword from `s` and changing the type of `s` to `long`. This can be done by replacing the line `static int s = -5L;` with `long s = -5L;`.\n\nThe optimized program will look like this:\n```\nint fn1(int p1, int p2) { return p2; }\n\nstruct m {\n  int n;\n  int o;\n};\n\nint r;\nlong s = -5L;\nunsigned t;\nint u;\n\nint main() {\n  struct m ad = {1957};\n  int ae;\n  int af = t;\n  ad.o = fn1(t, 5);\n  ae = ad.o;\n  ad.o = u;\n  r = af % (~s / ae);\n  ad.o;\n}\n```\nThis optimized program is now using the `long` data type for `s`, which can store larger values than an `int` variable. This can improve the performance of the program by reducing the number of times the program needs to perform overflow checks.",
