Since `u` is a constant, the expression `t % (~s_high / u)` can be evaluated at compile time, and the result can be stored in the variable `r` directly.\n\nAdditionally, the function `fn1` is also optimized out because it is only called with constant arguments, so the call can be inlined and the function can be eliminated.\n\nThe resulting program is equivalent to the original program, but with the variable `ae` and the function `fn1` optimized out.",
