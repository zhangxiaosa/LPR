The main function contains a local variable `ad` of type `m`, which is initialized with a value of `1957`. The `o` member of `ad` is set to the result of a call to `fn1` with an argument of `5`. The `o` member of `ad` is then set to the value of `u`, which is not defined in the program. The remainder of the main function consists of a calculation of `r` using the `t` variable and the result of the `fn1` call. The final statement of the main function is the evaluation of the `o` member of `ad`.\n\nTherefore, the identified loop structures are:\n\n* []",
