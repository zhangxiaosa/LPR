The target to be optimized is `r`.\n\nHere is the optimized program:\n```\nint fn1(int p2) { return p2; }\n\nstruct m {\n  int n : 18;\n  int o : 1;\n};\n\nunsigned r;\nunsigned t;\nint u;\n\nint main() {\n  struct m ad = {1957};\n  ad.o = fn1(5);\n  u = ad.o;\n  ad.o = u;\n  r = t % (5 / u);\n  ad.o;\n}\n```\nIn this optimized program, the `fn1()` function is not needed, so it can be removed. The `main()` function is optimized to reduce the number of instructions. The `ad.o` variable is assigned a value of `5` instead of calling the `fn1()` function. The `t` variable is assigned a value of `5 / u`, which is the same as the `ad.o` variable. The `r` variable is assigned a value of `t % (5 / u)`, which is the same as the `ad.o` variable. The `ad.o` variable is not used after it is assigned a value, so it can be removed.\n\nHere is the optimized program with the `fn1()` function removed and the `ad.o` variable removed:\n```\nstruct m {\n  int n : 18;\n  int o : 1;\n};\n\nunsigned r;\nunsigned t;\nint u;\n\nint main() {\n  struct m ad = {1957};\n  u = 5;\n  t = 5 / u;\n  r = t % (5 / u);\n}\n```\nIn this optimized program, the `fn1()` function is not needed, so it can be removed.
