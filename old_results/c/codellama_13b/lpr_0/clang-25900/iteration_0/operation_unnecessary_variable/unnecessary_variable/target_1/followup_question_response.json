The `p` variable was also removed, as it is not used in the program. Additionally, the `q` variable was removed, as it is not used in the program.\n\nThe constant propagation optimization was also applied to the `fn3` function. In the original function, the `af` variable was assigned the value of `t`, and then the `%` operator was used to divide the result by the value of `s`. However, the value of `s` is known to be -5L, which is a constant. Therefore, the `%` operator can be simplified to a simple division operation, and the `af` variable can be eliminated.\n\nThe copy propagation optimization was also applied to the `fn3` function. In the original function, the `ad` variable was assigned a value, and then the `o` field of the `ad` variable was assigned the value of the `v` variable. However, the `ad` variable is never used again, and the `o` field of the `ad` variable is only used to compute the value of the `r` variable. Therefore, the `ad` variable can be eliminated, and the `o` field of the `ad` variable can be converted into a simple variable.\n\nOverall, these optimizations have resulted in a more efficient and simpler program that achieves the same functionality as the original program.",
