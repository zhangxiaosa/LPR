This means that the function `fn1` is no longer called, and its code has been replaced with the code of the function `fn3` wherever it is called.\n\nThe inlining of `fn1` has removed the function call overhead, which can improve the performance of the program. However, it may also increase the code size and increase the complexity of the program, which may have a negative impact on its performance on some platforms.\n\nIt is important to note that the inlining of `fn1` has been done for the specific optimization goal of reducing the function call overhead, and it may not be appropriate for all optimization goals. It is important to carefully analyze the impact of the optimization on the program's performance and behavior before applying it.",
