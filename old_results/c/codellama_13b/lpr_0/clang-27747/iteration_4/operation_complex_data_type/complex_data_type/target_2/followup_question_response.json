In this case, the target variable is `struct c i, j`, which is a complex data type variable.\n\nTo decompose `struct c i, j` into variables with primary data types, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Extract the members of `struct c` into separate variables. In this case, `struct c` has only one member, `int d : 18;`.\n2. Replace the occurrences of `i` and `j` with the extracted members.\n\nHere is the optimized program:\n```\nint main() {\n  struct c l;\n  l.d = j_d;\n  int n = j_d && l_d;\n  i_d = l_d | -(l_d && l_d) - n;\n}\n```\nIn this optimized program, `i_d` and `j_d` are the extracted members of `struct c i, j`, and they are used instead of the complex data type variables.
