The `bitwise AND` operator is more efficient for this operation because it only requires one bit to be set in both operands, whereas the `logical AND` operator requires both operands to be non-zero.\n\nHere is the optimized program:\n```\nstruct c {\n  int d : 18;\n};\n\nint i_d;\n\nint d;\n\nint n;\n\nint main() {\n  struct c l;\n  l.d = i_d;\n  n = i_d & l.d;\n  i_d = l.d | -(l.d & l.d) - n;\n}\n```\nIn this optimized program, the `logical AND` operator has been replaced with the `bitwise AND` operator, resulting in a faster execution time.",

Since `i_d` is an integer and `l.d` is a 18-bit integer, we can simplify the expression to:\n```\nn = i_d & 0x3FFFF;\n```\nThis expression is equivalent to the original expression `n = i_d && l.d`, but it uses a lower-level operator (`&`) that may be more efficient on the target hardware.\n\nTherefore, the optimized program can be written as:\n```\nstruct c {\n  int d : 18;\n};\n\nint i_d;\n\nint main() {\n  struct c l;\n  l.d = i_d;\n  int n = i_d & 0x3FFFF;\n  i_d = l.d | -(l.d && l.d) - n;\n}\n```",

The resulting program will be:\n```\nint i_d;\n\nint main() {\n  int l_d = i_d;\n  int n = i_d && l_d;\n  i_d = l_d | -(l_d && l_d) - n;\n}\n```\nThis program still maintains the same functionality as the original program, but it has been decomposed into variables with primary data types.",
