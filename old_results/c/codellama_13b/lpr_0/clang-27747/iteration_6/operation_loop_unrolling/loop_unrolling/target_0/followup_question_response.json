The iteration variable `i` is used to access the elements of the struct `l` and perform the required operations.\n\nNote that the loop unrolling optimization is only applicable if the loop has a fixed number of iterations.

Assignment of `l.d` to `i_d`\n2. Negation of `l.d` with the `-` operator\n3.
