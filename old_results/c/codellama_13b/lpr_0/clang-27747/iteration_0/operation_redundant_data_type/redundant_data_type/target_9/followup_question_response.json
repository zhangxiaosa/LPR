To optimize the program, we need to eliminate the struct and replace every instance of it with its associated original data type.\n\nIn this case, the original data type of `j` is `int`. Therefore, we can eliminate the struct and replace every instance of `j` with `int`.\n\nHere is the optimized program:\n```\nint d;\nint e;\nint f;\nint h;\n\nint i;\n\nint fn1() {\n  int l = {24, 6738, 165};\n  int m = e;\n  l.d = m;\n  int n = h && l.d;\n  int o = l.d;\n  i.d = o | -(f && l.d) - n;\n}\n\nint main() {}\n```\nIn this optimized program, we have eliminated the struct `c` and replaced every instance of `j` with `int`. We have also modified the function `fn1()` to use the new data type `int` instead of `struct c`.",

This results in the following optimized program:\n```\nstruct c {\n  int d : 18;\n  int e;\n  int f;\n  int h;\n};\n\nstruct c i;\nstruct c l = {24, 6738, 165};\n\nint fn1() {\n  int m = l.e;\n  l.d = m;\n  int n = l.h && l.d;\n  int o = l.d;\n  i.d = o | -(l.f && l.d) - n;\n}\n\nint main() {}\n```\nIn this optimized program, the `struct c j` variable is eliminated and replaced with the `struct c l` variable, which is initialized with the same values as `j`. This allows the program to avoid the overhead of accessing the `struct c j` variable and instead uses the `struct c l` variable directly.",

The data type \"struct c\" is eliminated and replaced with the more basic data type \"int\", which is more commonly used in C programming. Additionally, the variables \"i\" and \"j\" are declared as \"int\" instead of \"struct c\", which makes the program more readable and easier to understand.",
