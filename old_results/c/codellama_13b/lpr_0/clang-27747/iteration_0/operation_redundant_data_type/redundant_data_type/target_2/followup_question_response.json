This is because the `int` data type is a signed integer type that can store any value in the range of -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. Since the original `signed` data type was used for the `d`, `g`, and `h` members of the `struct c` type, and they are all used as integers in the program, it is safe to replace them with `int`.\n\nThe `unsigned` data type is also replaced with `int`, as it is a synonym for `unsigned int`, which is an unsigned integer type that can store any value in the range of 0 to 4,294,967,295. Since the `unsigned` data type is used for the `e` and `f` members of the `struct c` type, and they are used as integers in the program, it is safe to replace them with `int`.\n\nAfter making these changes, the program is optimized to use the `int` data type for all the members of the `struct c` type, which is more efficient and readable than using the `signed` and `unsigned` data types for some members and `int` for others.",
