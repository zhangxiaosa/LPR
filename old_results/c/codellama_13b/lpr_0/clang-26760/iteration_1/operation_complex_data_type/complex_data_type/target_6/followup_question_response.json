Use \"register\" keyword to declare variables that are used frequently in the code and should be stored in registers.\n2. Use \"auto\" keyword to declare variables that are only used in the current function and do not need to be stored in memory.\n3. Use \"static\" keyword to declare variables that are used frequently in the code and should be stored in memory.\n4. Use \"inline\" keyword to declare functions that are used frequently in the code and should be inlined.\n5. Use \"const\" keyword to declare variables that are constant and should not be modified.\n6. Use \"volatile\" keyword to declare variables that are used frequently in the code and should be stored in memory.\n7. Use \"restrict\" keyword to declare variables that are used frequently in the code and should be stored in memory.\n8. Use \"aligned\" keyword to declare variables that are used frequently in the code and should be stored in memory.\n\nBy using these techniques, we can reduce the number of memory accesses and improve the performance of the program.",

The program is optimized to use pointers to store the 64-bit values, which can improve the performance of the program by reducing the number of memory accesses required to perform the operations.\n\nHere is the optimized program that uses pointers to store the 64-bit values:\n```\nint g;\nint fn1() {\n  unsigned j_high_low_low = 0x24F96B7B;\n  unsigned j_high_low_high = 0x00000000;\n  unsigned k;\n  unsigned *j_low = &j_high_low_low;\n  unsigned *j_high = &j_high_low_high;\n  unsigned *m = &j_high_low_low;\n  unsigned *o = &j_high_low_high;\n  unsigned *k = &j_high_low_high;\n\n  for (g = 0; g;) {\n    for (; *j_low > 0; --*j_low)\n      ;\n    *j_high = 0;\n  }\n\n  *m = *j_low;\n  *o = g;\n\nq:;\n  *k = *k >> 1L;\n  if (*o) {\n    *k = *k << *m;\n    goto q;\n  }\n}\nint main() {}\n```\nIn this optimized program, the variables `j_low`, `j_high`, `m`, `o`, and `k` are all pointers to the corresponding variables in the original program. This allows the program to use pointers to store the 64-bit values, which can improve the performance of the program by reducing the number of memory accesses required to perform the operations.",

For example, we can create the following variables:\n\n1. `j_high_low_low_high`: This is the high byte of the 2-byte variable `j_high_low_low`.\n2. `j_high_low_low_low`: This is the low byte of the 2-byte variable `j_high_low_low`.\n3. `j_high_low_high_high`: This is the high byte of the 2-byte variable `j_high_low_high`.\n4. `j_high_low_high_low`: This is the low byte of the 2-byte variable `j_high_low_high`.\n\nBy decomposing the variables into individual bytes, we can simplify the program and reduce the number of instructions.
