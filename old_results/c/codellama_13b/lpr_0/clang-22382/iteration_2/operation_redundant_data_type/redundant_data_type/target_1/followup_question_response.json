This is done by changing the type of the `p1` parameter in the `fn2` function to `int`, and by changing the type of the `k` field in the `struct s` to `int`.\n\nThe `goto` statement in the `fn1` function has also been eliminated by removing the associated label and replacing it with a `return` statement.\n\nFinally, the `for` loop in `fn2` has been eliminated by removing the associated loop variable and replacing it with a `while` loop.\n\nOverall, this optimized program is more concise and easier to read than the original program, and it has eliminated the use of the `unsigned` data type.",
