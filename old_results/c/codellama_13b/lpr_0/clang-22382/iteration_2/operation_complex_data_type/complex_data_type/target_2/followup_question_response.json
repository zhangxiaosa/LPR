We have also modified the function fn1 to take two integer parameters instead of a struct s parameter.\n\nThis modification has reduced the complexity of the program and made it easier to analyze and optimize. It also makes it easier to understand and maintain the program.\n\nIn summary, to optimize the program, we need to identify the bottleneck and decompose complex data types into variables with primary data types.
