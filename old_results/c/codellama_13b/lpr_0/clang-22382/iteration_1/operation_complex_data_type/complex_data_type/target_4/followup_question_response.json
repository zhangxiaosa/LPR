For example, `fn1` takes a `struct s` as its third argument, which is an element of the array. Similarly, `fn2` takes an `unsigned` as its only argument, which is used as an index into the array of `struct s`.\n\nTherefore, we can decompose the variables with complex data types as follows:\n\n* `struct s` can be decomposed into `long i`, `long j`, and `unsigned k`.\n* `struct s[]` can be decomposed into an array of `struct s`, where each `struct s` is decomposed into `long i`, `long j`, and `unsigned k`.\n\nWith this decomposition, we can optimize the program by replacing the complex data types with simpler data types that are easier to optimize. For example, we can replace `struct s` with a single `long` variable, and replace `struct s[]` with an array of `long` variables. This will simplify the program and make it easier to optimize.",

Use a single array of `struct s` to store all the structs instead of creating a new array for each struct.\n2. Use a pointer to a struct instead of a struct itself as a parameter to `fn1` and `fn2`. This will reduce the amount of data being copied and will improve performance.\n3. Use a loop instead of a `goto` statement to iterate over the array of structs. This will improve the readability and maintainability of the code.\n4. Use a single `struct s` variable instead of creating a new one for each iteration.
