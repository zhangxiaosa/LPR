This optimization is known as \"copy propagation\" and it allows the compiler to eliminate the unused variable `q`.\n\nNote that this optimization is only possible if the variable `q` is not used anywhere else in the program.

This is achieved by replacing all occurrences of `q` with `p5` in the function body of `fn2`. This optimization is called constant propagation.\n\nAlso, the function `fn1` is optimized by removing the unused variable `p5` and the `goto` statement. The function becomes:\n```\nstatic struct s fn1(unsigned p1) {\n  p1;\nw:;\n  goto w;\n}\n```\nIn this optimized version, the function `fn1` is now only responsible for computing the value of `p1` and jumping to the label `w`.
