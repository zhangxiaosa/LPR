To optimize this variable, we can eliminate it by replacing it with its associated original data type, which is `struct h`. This can be done by modifying the `fn1` function to take the `d` parameter as a `struct h` instead of a `d`.\n\nHere is the modified `fn1` function:\n```\nstruct h fn1(unsigned p1, signed p2, unsigned p3, unsigned p4, struct h p5) {\n  p5.k;\nw:;\n  goto w;\n}\n```\nIn this modified `fn1` function, the `d` parameter is replaced with a `struct h` parameter. This eliminates the need for the `d` variable, which can reduce the memory usage of the program.\n\nNote that this optimization is only possible if the `d` variable is not used anywhere else in the program. If the `d` variable is used in other parts of the program, then it cannot be eliminated.",

Therefore, it is not possible to optimize it without changing its behavior.\n\nHowever, if we were to assume that the `goto` statement is intended to be inside a loop or a conditional statement, we could rewrite the program as follows:\n```\nstruct h {\n  int i;\n  long j;\n  unsigned k;\n};\nunsigned l;\nstatic struct h fn1(unsigned, signed, unsigned, unsigned, struct h);\nunsigned fn2(unsigned p1) {\n  struct h p;\n  signed q;\n  for (;;) {\n    struct h r = p;\n    p = r;\n  }\n}\nstruct h fn1(unsigned p1, signed p2, unsigned p3, unsigned p4, struct h p5) {\n  if (p5.k) {\n    goto w;\n  }\n  goto w;\n}\n```\nIn this rewritten version of the program, the `goto` statement is inside a conditional statement, which allows it to be optimized without changing its behavior.\n\nIt is important to note that the behavior of the program may change if the `goto` statement is not inside a loop or conditional statement, as it would cause an infinite loop. Therefore, it is important to carefully review the program and ensure that the `goto` statement is used correctly.",
