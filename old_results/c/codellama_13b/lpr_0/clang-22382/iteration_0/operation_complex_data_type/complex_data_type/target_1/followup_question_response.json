In the given program, p2 is passed as an argument to fn1(), and it is defined as a signed integer.

Use a signed integer type instead of a signed integer type for p2:\nSince p2 is already a signed integer, using a signed integer type instead of a signed integer type for p2 will not change the data type of p2. Therefore, this technique will not optimize p2.\n2. Use a signed integer type with a smaller size than the current signed integer type:\nIf we use a signed integer type with a smaller size than the current signed integer type, we may encounter data loss or truncation.
