The `fn2` function will have the same body as the original program, but the variable `q` will be optimized to be a local variable instead of a global variable.\n\nHere is the optimized code:\n```\nstruct s {\n  long k;\n};\n\nstatic struct s fn1(struct s p5) {\n  p5.k;\n}\n\nlong fn2() {\n  struct s q;\n  fn1(q);\n  for (;;) {\n    struct s r = q;\n    q = r;\n  }\n}\n\nint main() {}\n```",

The `k` variable is still present in the `struct s` because it is used in the `fn1` function.\n\nThe optimization is done by constant propagation or copy propagation, which is a technique used in compiler optimization. The goal of this optimization is to eliminate unused variables and replace them with constants or other values that can be computed at compile-time.\n\nIn this case, the variables `i` and `j` in the `struct s` are not used in any way, so they can be safely removed. The `k` variable is still present because it is used in the `fn1` function.\n\nThe `fn1` function is also optimized by the compiler, as it has an infinite loop that does not do anything. The `goto w` statement allows the function to jump to the `w` label, which is an infinite loop. The `goto w` statement is not necessary, so it can be removed.\n\nThe `fn2` function is also optimized by the compiler, as it has an infinite loop that does not do anything. The `for` loop is an infinite loop, so it can be removed. The `q` variable is not used in the loop, so it can be removed.\n\nOverall, the optimization is done to improve the performance and reduce the size of the program. The optimized program is smaller and more efficient than the original program.",
