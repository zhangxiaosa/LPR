This optimization is done by replacing the function call to `fn1(p3, i)` with the multiplication operation `p3 * i`. This results in a more efficient and concise code.",

The optimized code is equivalent to the original code, but with the function call to `fn1` replaced with the body of the function.\n\nThe function `fn1` is inlined into `fn2` because it is only called once within the `fn2` function, and it has a simple implementation that can be easily inlined. By inlining the function, we can avoid the overhead of the function call and improve the performance of the program.",

This means that the function call to `fn1` has been replaced with the body of the function, allowing the compiler to optimize out the function call and generate more efficient code.\n\nThe `main` function has also been modified to call `fn1` directly instead of calling `fn2` and then calling `fn1` from within `fn2`. This allows the compiler to further optimize the code by avoiding the extra function call.\n\nThe final optimized program is more efficient and easier to understand than the original program, which called a function that was defined in a separate function.",

This has allowed us to eliminate the function call overhead associated with calling `fn1` repeatedly. Instead, we have replaced the function call with the body of `fn1`, which has the same behavior as the original `fn1` function.\n\nThe `&& 1L` at the end of the line has been added to ensure that the result of the multiplication is treated as a long integer, which is the correct type for the `j` variable.\n\nBy inlining `fn1` directly into `fn2`, we have eliminated the need for the function call overhead, which has resulted in a faster and more efficient program.",
