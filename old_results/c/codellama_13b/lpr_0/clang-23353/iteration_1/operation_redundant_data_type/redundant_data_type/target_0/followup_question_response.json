The function `fn2` has also been modified to use `int` instead of `char` for its parameter `p3`.\n\nThis modification is done to make the program more efficient and easier to read, as the `char` data type is not appropriate for mathematical operations like multiplication and subtraction.",

This is because the for loop in `fn2` uses the `!=` operator, which is not defined for `char` data type. By changing the data type to `int`, we can avoid the issue and the program will still work correctly.\n\nWe have also changed the data type of the return value of `fn1` from `char` to `int`. This is because the `&&` operator is not defined for `char` data type and the `^` operator is not defined for `char` and `long long` data types. By changing the data type to `int`, we can avoid the issue and the program will still work correctly.\n\nNote that this optimization is not a complete optimization, there may be other optimizations that can be done to the program, but this is a basic optimization that addresses the issues with the data types.",
