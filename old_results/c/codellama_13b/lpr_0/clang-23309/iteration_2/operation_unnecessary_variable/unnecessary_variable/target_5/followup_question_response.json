Therefore, we can replace all occurrences of `p2` with `ac` and remove the parameter `p2` from the function signature.\n\nAdditionally, we have optimized the variable `v` by copy propagation. In the `fn10` function, `v` is assigned the value `fn2_optimized(ao - (fn6_optimized(1, an) & 1) << 8, ac) & 1`.
