The variable `p` is never used in the program, so it can be safely optimized out.\n2. The variable `w` is never used in the program, so it can be safely optimized out.\n3. The variable `an` is only used in the `fn10` function, and it is only used to calculate the value of `p2`. Since `p2` is the only use of `an`, it can be optimized out and the calculation of `p2` can be simplified.\n4. The variable `ao` is only used in the `fn10` function, and it is only used to calculate the value of `v`. Since `v` is the only use of `ao`, it can be optimized out and the calculation of `v` can be simplified.\n5. The variable `ac` is only used in the `fn10` function, and it is only used to calculate the value of `p2`. Since `p2` is the only use of `ac`, it can be optimized out and the calculation of `p2` can be simplified.\n\nAfter applying these optimizations, the program becomes:\n```\nunsigned fn2_optimized(unsigned p1, short p2) { return p1 - p2; }\nunsigned fn5(short p1, short p2) { return p2; }\nunsigned fn6_optimized(unsigned p1, short p2) { return p2; }\nunsigned p;\nvoid fn9(unsigned p1, char *p2) { p = p1; }\nunsigned v;\nshort w;\nshort ac = 1;\nunsigned fn10(unsigned p1, short p2) {\n  p2 = fn5(1, 1) || (250 == 0x294A85636008822D);\n  v = fn2_optimized(0xBCD1 - (fn6_optimized(1, 250) & 1) << 8, p2) & 1;\n  return v;\n}\nunsigned fn13() {\n  fn10(v, v);\n  return 1;\n}\nint main() {\n  fn13();\n  fn9(v, \"g_170\");\n  printf(\"checksum = %X\\n\", p);\n  return 0;\n}\n```\nNote that the optimizations applied in this example are not exhaustive, and there may be other optimizations that could be applied to the program depending on its specific context and requirements.",

This is because `v` is the only variable that is actually used in the program, and it is the only variable that is modified by the function `fn13`.\n\nAdditionally, we have removed the local variable `p` from the program, since it is not used anywhere.\n\nThe constant propagation optimization has been done in the following ways:\n\n* In the function `fn10`, the expression `fn5(ac, ac) || (an = w) == 0x294A85636008822D` is simplified to `ac || (an = w) == 0x294A85636008822D`, since `fn5` always returns its second argument.\n* In the function `fn10`, the expression `(fn6_optimized(1, an) & 1) << 8` is simplified to `1 << 8`, since `fn6_optimized` always returns its second argument.\n* In the function `fn10`, the expression `fn2_optimized(ao - (fn6_optimized(1, an) & 1) << 8, p2) & 1` is simplified to `fn2_optimized(ao - 1 << 8, p2) & 1`, since `fn6_optimized` always returns its second argument.\n\nThe copy propagation optimization has been done in the following ways:\n\n* In the function `fn10`, the expression `fn5(ac, ac)` is replaced with `ac`, since `fn5` always returns its second argument.\n* In the function `fn10`, the expression `(an = w) == 0x294A85636008822D` is replaced with `w == 0x294A85636008822D`, since `(an = w)` is equivalent to `w` in this context.\n* In the function `fn10`, the expression `fn6_optimized(1, an)` is replaced with `an`, since `fn6_optimized` always returns its second argument.\n\nBy applying these optimizations, the program has been simplified and made more efficient. The resulting program is shorter and easier to understand than the original program, and it still produces the same output for the same input.",
