This should result in a significant performance improvement, as `unsigned` is a more efficient data type for arithmetic operations.\n\nNote that in this optimized program, the `fn2_optimized` function has been modified to use `unsigned` instead of `short`. This is because the `short` data type is signed, which can result in unexpected behavior in certain situations. By using `unsigned`, we can avoid this issue and ensure that the function behaves as expected.",
