This optimization is possible because `fn6` is a pure function, meaning that it only depends on its input parameters and does not have any side effects.

This means that the function call to `fn6` has been replaced with the body of the function, which simply returns `p2`. This has allowed the compiler to eliminate the function call and any associated overhead, such as pushing and popping the function arguments onto the stack.\n\nBy inlining the function, the program has also been able to eliminate the need for the function `fn6` entirely, which has reduced the overall size of the program and improved its performance.",

This means that the `fn6` function is no longer a separate function call, but is instead performed directly within the `fn10` function.\n\nThe result of this optimization is that the program runs faster and uses less memory, as it eliminates the overhead of function calls. Additionally, the `fn6` function is no longer needed, so it can be removed from the program completely.\n\nNote that this optimization is only valid if the `fn6` function is not used anywhere else in the program. If the `fn6` function is used elsewhere in the program, then this optimization would not be appropriate.",

This can result in faster execution time and reduced memory usage.\n\nThe inlined version of `fn6` is:\n```\nunsigned fn10(p2) {\n  unsigned an = 250;\n  p2 = ac || (an = w) == 0x294A85636008822D;\n  return fn2((short)0xBCD1 - (p2 & 1) << 8, p2) & 1;\n}\n```\nIn this version, the `fn6` function has been replaced with the `p2 & 1` expression, which is the same as the expression inside the `fn6` function. This has resulted in a more compact and efficient program.\n\nNote that the optimization is only possible because the `fn6` function is only called once in the program, and the result of the function call is not used anywhere else.

This means that the code for `fn6` has been copied directly into `fn10`, rather than calling the function. This can improve performance, as it eliminates the overhead of function calls.\n\nNote that the inlining was done in a way that preserves the behavior of the original program. The optimization is valid because the `fn6` function is only used to return a value that is not used anywhere else in the program. The `fn10` function uses the return value of `fn6` to compute the result of the function, but it does not modify the value of `fn6`. Therefore, it is safe to inline the `fn6` function without changing the behavior of the program.",
