Therefore, the type of the variable `an` in `fn10` is also inferred as `short`, and the type of the expression `(fn6(1, an) & 1) << 8` is `short`.\n\nThe type of the expression `fn2((short)0xBCD1 - (fn6(1, an) & 1) << 8, p2)` is also `short`, as it is the difference of two `short` values. Therefore, the type of the expression `(fn2((short)0xBCD1 - (fn6(1, an) & 1) << 8, p2) & 1)` is `short`.\n\nFinally, the type of the expression `fn10(0)` is `unsigned`, as it is the return value of the function `fn10`, which is declared as returning an `unsigned` value. Therefore, the type of the variable `checksum` in the call to `printf` is `unsigned`.\n\nOverall, the program is well-formed and the types of all expressions are consistent.",
