In the function `fn10`, the variable `ao` is not used, so we can remove it.\n2. In the function `fn13`, the variable `ae` is not used, so we can remove it.\n3. In the main function, the variable `ap` is not used, so we can remove it.\n\nWith these optimizations, the program becomes smaller and more efficient.",

This variable was previously used in the `fn10` function as an intermediate result, but it was not used in any subsequent operations. Therefore, it was safe to remove it and simplify the code.\n\nAdditionally, I have also optimized the `fn2` function by replacing the `ao` variable with a constant value. This allowed me to simplify the arithmetic operation and eliminate the unused variable.\n\nThe resulting program is shorter and easier to read, and it should have the same behavior as the original program.",
