This is because `char` is a small integer type that is often used to represent a single character or a single byte of data. However, in the given program, the `char` type is not being used in a way that requires it to be a separate data type. By using `int` or `short` instead of `char`, we can simplify the program and make it more efficient.\n\nIn particular, we have replaced the `char` parameters of `fn9` with `int`, and we have changed the return type of `fn9` from `void` to `int`. We have also changed the `char` parameter of `fn10` to `short`. This is because `short` is a smaller integer type that can represent values up to 32,767, which is sufficient for the range of values that the `char` parameter is used for in the given program.\n\nBy making these changes, we have eliminated the `char` data type from the program and replaced it with more appropriate types. This has simplified the program and made it more efficient.",
