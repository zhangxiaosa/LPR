The `fn2` function returns a `d` type value, which is initialized with the `fn1` function. The `main` function returns an `int` value of 0.",

The type of the compound literal is `d`, which is a typedef for a vector of `long` values with the size of a `long` value.\n\nThe `main()` function is the entry point of the program. It is a function that takes no arguments and returns no value.",
