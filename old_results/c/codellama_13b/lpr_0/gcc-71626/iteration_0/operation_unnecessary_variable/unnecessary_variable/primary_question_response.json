The `fn1` function has no parameters and no body, while the `fn2` function takes no parameters and returns a value of type `d`. The `d` type is an alias for a vector of `long` with a size of `sizeof(long)`. The function `fn2` declares a local variable `c` of type `long` and assigns it the value of the function `fn1`. It then creates an instance of the `d` type and initializes it with the value of `c`. Finally, it returns the initialized `d` type instance.",
