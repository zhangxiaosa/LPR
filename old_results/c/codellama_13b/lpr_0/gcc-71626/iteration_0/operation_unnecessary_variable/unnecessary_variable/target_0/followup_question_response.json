The optimization we can perform is to eliminate the unused variable `a` and the unnecessary initialization of `c` inside `fn2()`.\n\nAfter constant propagation, we can see that `c` is initialized to `fn1`, which is a function pointer. Since `fn1` is not used, we can eliminate it and directly return the array of `long` values from `fn2()`.\n\nAfter copy propagation, we can see that `b` is assigned the return value of `fn2()`, which is an array of `long` values. Since `b` is not used, we can eliminate it and return the array directly from `main()`.\n\nTherefore, the optimized program looks like this:\n```\nfn1() {}\n\ntypedef long d __attribute__((__vector_size__(sizeof(long))));\n\nd fn2() {\n  return (long[]){ fn1 };\n}\n\nmain() {\n  return fn2();\n}\n```\nIn this optimized program, we have eliminated the unused variable `a` and the unnecessary initialization of `c` inside `fn2()`.
