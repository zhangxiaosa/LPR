This means that we can replace the `d` data type with a vector of `long` integers.\n2. `fn1`:\nWe cannot decompose a function into primitive data types, as it is not a data type. Instead, we can replace the function with a function pointer, which is a data type that holds the address of a function.\n\nTherefore, the decompose variables with complex data types are:\n\n1. `d`:\n```\ntypedef long d[sizeof(long)];\n```\nThis declares a vector of long integers with a size of `sizeof(long)`.\n2. `fn1`:\n```\ntypedef void (*fn1)();\n```\nThis declares a function pointer with no return type.\n\nThe final program with the decompose variables is:\n```\ntypedef long d[sizeof(long)];\ntypedef void (*fn1)();\n\nd fn2() { return (d){fn1}; }\nmain() {}\n```",

In this case, we can break down the complex data type into three separate `long` variables, `x`, `y`, and `z`, each with a size of `sizeof(long)`.\n\nHere is the modified program with primary data types:\n```\nint main() {\n  long x = fn1();\n  long y = fn2();\n  long z = fn3();\n\n  long a = x + y + z;\n\n  return a;\n}\n```\nIn this modified program, the `x`, `y`, and `z` variables are now primary data types, and the `a` variable is also a primary data type.
