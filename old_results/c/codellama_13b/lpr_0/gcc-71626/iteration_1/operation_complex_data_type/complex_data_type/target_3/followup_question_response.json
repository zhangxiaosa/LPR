The function calculates the sum of `a` and `b`, stores the result in `c`, and then calculates the product of `c` and 2, stores the result in `d`. The function uses the `sizeof` operator to determine the size of the arrays `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, and uses a `for` loop to iterate over the elements of the arrays.\n\nHere is the modified program that uses the optimized function:\n```\ntypedef long d __attribute__((__vector_size__(sizeof(long))));\nd fn2() {\n    long a[10], b[10], c[10], d[10];\n    fn1(a, b, c, d);\n    return (d){fn1};\n}\n\nint main() {\n    fn2();\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nThis program uses the `typedef` keyword to define a vector of long integers, and uses the `fn2` function to return the result of the `fn1` function.
