In this case, we want to perform the loop 10 times, so `N = 10`.\n\n2. Unroll the loop by replacing it with `N` iterations of the loop body. In this case, the loop body is `r -= 1`, so we will replace the loop with `r -= 1` repeated 10 times.\n\n3. Update the variable `i` to reflect the number of unrolled iterations. The loop counter `i` is no longer necessary in this case as we are unrolling the loop completely. We can remove the line `int i;`.\n\n4. Update the `printf` statement to print the correct variable. The current `printf` statement prints `r` which no longer holds the correct value. We need to change it to print `checksum` instead.\n\n5. Remove the unused variable `i` from the `printf` statement.\n\n6.

The target loop to be optimized is the inner while loop with the condition `r > 1L`.\n2. Loop unrolling is a technique to reduce loops' overhead by manually replicating loop bodies multiple times.\n3. In this case, we can unroll the loop to execute its body multiple times without the need for condition checking in each iteration.\n4. Since the original code has `while (r > 1L) r -= 1;`, it can be unrolled as:\n\n```c\nwhile (r > 1L) {\n  r -= 1;\n  while (r > 1L) {\n    r -= 1;\n    while (r > 1L) {\n      r -= 1;\n      // ... Unroll the loop body further as needed ...\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n5. Determine the number of iterations you want to unroll based on your optimization goals. For simplicity, let's unroll it three times.\n6. Now, replace the original loop with the unrolled loop in the program:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n  int i;\n  short r = 0;\n\n  for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n    r -= 1;\n    while (r > 1L) {\n      r -= 1;\n      while (r > 1L) {\n        r -= 1;\n        while (r > 1L) {\n          r -= 1;\n          // ... Unroll the loop body further as needed ...\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  printf(\"checksum = %X\\n\", r);\n  return 0;\n}\n```\n\n7.
