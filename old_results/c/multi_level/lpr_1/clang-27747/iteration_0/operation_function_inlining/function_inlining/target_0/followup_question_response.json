Inlining a function involves replacing a function call with the body of the function itself.\n2. The target function to be optimized is `fn1()`, which returns a value of type `b`.\n3. The function `fn1()` initializes a local variable `l` of type `struct c` with some values.\n4. It then assigns the value of `j.e` to `l.d`.\n5. It calculates the values of `n`, `o`, and `p` based on the values of `j.h`, `l.d`, `l.f`, and `n`.\n6. Finally, it assigns the value of `p` to `i.g`.\n7. Since there is no explicit return statement, the return type of `fn1()` suggests that it should return the value stored in `i.g`.\n8.
