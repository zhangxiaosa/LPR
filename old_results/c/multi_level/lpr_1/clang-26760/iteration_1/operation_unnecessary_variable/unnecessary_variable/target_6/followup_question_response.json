Replace the occurrences accordingly, propagating the constant or variable value instead of the variable `o`.\n\nLet's analyze the program step by step:\n\n1. The variable `o` is initialized with the value of `n`, which is assigned the value of `g`. Therefore, `o` is initially `g`.\n\n2. There are no further assignments or modifications to `o` in the program.\n\n3. The variable `p` is assigned the value of `o`. Since `o` is a constant at this point (initialized with `g`), the assignment `unsigned p = o;` can be replaced with `unsigned p = g;`.\n\n4. The variable `p` is used in the while loop condition `while (p)`. As `p` is constant (initialized with `g`), the condition will be true as long as `g` is not zero.\n\n5. Inside the while loop, there are a few operations involving `p`, but they do not modify the value of `o`. Therefore, no changes are required in the loop.\n\n6. The variable `o` is not used anywhere else in the program.

Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. Start by analyzing the usage of the variable `o`.\n   - The variable `o` is assigned the value of `n`, which is assigned the value of `g`.\n   - It appears that `g` is a global variable since it is declared outside the `main` function.\n\n2. Examine the usage of the global variable `g`.\n   - The value of `g` is never modified or used within the program.\n   - Since it is not used, we can optimize it out as well.\n\n3. Replace the occurrences of the variable `o` with a constant or remove the unused assignment altogether.\n   - Since `o` is not used anywhere in the program, we can simply remove the assignment `int o = n;`.\n\n4.
