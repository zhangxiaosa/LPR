Identify the loop to be optimized: `for (s = 0; s <= 39; ++s)`.\n2. Determine the loop bounds: The loop starts with `s` equal to 0 and ends when `s` becomes 40.\n3.

Loop unrolling is a technique in which the loop body is duplicated to reduce the number of loop iterations. In this case, we can unroll the loop by a factor of `4`, meaning each iteration of the loop will be replaced by four iterations.\n\nHere's the step-by-step analysis and modification of the program:\n\n1.

Modify the loop variables: In each iteration of the unrolled loop, modify the loop variable `s` based on the unrolled index `i`. The modified loop will look like:\n\n```c\nfor (unsigned int i = 0; i <= 9; ++i) {\n  unsigned int s = i * 4;\n  // Loop body iteration 1\n  // Loop body iteration 2\n  // Loop body iteration 3\n  // Loop body iteration 4\n}\n```\n\n3.
