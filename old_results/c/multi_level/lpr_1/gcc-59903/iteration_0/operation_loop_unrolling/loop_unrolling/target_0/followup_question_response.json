The target loop is `for (; a; a += 1)`.\n2. We will unroll the loop by a factor of `K`, where `K` is the number of iterations to be unrolled.\n3.

Loop unrolling reduces the number of loop iterations by executing multiple loop iterations together in a single iteration. Here's the step-by-step analysis and modification:\n\n1. Start with the original loop:\n   ```cpp\n   for (; a; a += 1)\n     n[0] = b;\n   ```\n\n2. Determine the number of loop iterations `N` based on the available information. Since we don't have the initial value of `a`, we will assume it to be a positive integer.\n\n3. Divide the loop iterations into multiple iterations to be executed together. Let's assume a loop unrolling factor of 4. So each iteration will execute 4 loop iterations.\n\n   ```cpp\n   for (; a >= 4; a -= 4) {\n     n[0] = b;\n     n[0] = b;\n     n[0] = b;\n     n[0] = b;\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. Handle the remaining iterations if `N` is not a multiple of the loop unrolling factor. Here, we haven't considered the remaining iterations.\n\n5. Optimize the loop exit condition after unrolling. Since each iteration executes 4 loop iterations, the exit condition of the unrolled loop becomes `a < 4`.\n\n   ```cpp\n   for (; a >= 4; a -= 4) {\n     n[0] = b;\n     n[0] = b;\n     n[0] = b;\n     n[0] = b;\n   }\n   for (; a; a -= 1)\n     n[0] = b;\n   ```\n\n6.
