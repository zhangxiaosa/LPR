Identify the original data types associated with the structure members `d` and `e`. In this case, both members are of type `int`.\n\n2. Replace the structure declaration `struct c f;` with individual declarations of the original data types:\n```c\nint d;\nint e;\n```\n\n3. Substitute every instance of `f.d` and `f.e` with the corresponding original data types:\n```c\nd\ne\n```\n\n4. Remove the structure definition `struct c { int d; int e; };` since it's no longer needed.\n\n5. Rewrite the `fn1` function with the modified code, replacing `f.d` and `f.e` with the original data types:\n```c\nchar fn1() {\n  if (e) {\n    d = 6;\n    fn1();\n    int j = 0xEEACFBBF;\n    return j;\n  }\n  fn1();\n  int j;\n  return j;\n}\n```\n\n6. Remove any unnecessary calls to `fn1()` if they are not impacting the final result.\n\n7.
