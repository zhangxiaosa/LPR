The \"fn1\" function takes a struct h parameter, does nothing with it except accessing the \"k\" member, and includes an infinite loop using the \"goto\" statement. The \"fn2\" function has no parameters, declares a struct h variable \"p\", calls the \"fn1\" function with \"p\" as an argument, and includes an infinite loop in which it assigns the value of \"p\" to a new struct h variable \"r\" and then assigns \"r\" back to \"p\" repeatedly. The main function does not contain any statements.\n\nStep 2: Eliminate and substitute target data type\nThe target data type to be optimized is \"int\".
