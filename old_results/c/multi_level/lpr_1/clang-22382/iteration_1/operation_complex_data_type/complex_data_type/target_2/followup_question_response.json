The program includes the standard input-output library `stdio.h`.\n2. It defines a structure `h` with three member variables: `i` of type `int`, `j` of type `long`, and `k` of type `int`.\n3. It declares a static function `fn1` that takes a parameter `p5` of type `struct h` and returns a value of type `struct h`.\n4. In the `fn1` function, it uses the member variable `k` of the input parameter `p5` but doesn't do anything with it. Then it goes into an infinite loop using the label `w`.\n5. It declares an unsigned function `fn2` that takes no parameters and returns an `unsigned` value.\n6. In the `fn2` function, it declares a variable `p` of type `struct h`. Then it calls the `fn1` function passing `p` as the argument.\n7. Inside an infinite loop, it declares a variable `r` of type `struct h`. It assigns `p` to `r` and then assigns `r` back to `p`.\n8. The `main` function is defined but it doesn't contain any executable code. It simply returns 0.\n\nTo decompose the complex data type `p5` into variables with primary data types, we need to declare separate variables for each member of the `h` structure.

We can create a new variable `int p5_i` and assign the value of `p5.i` to it.\n2. `p5.j` is a `long` component of `p5`.

It calls the `fn1` function with the `p` variable as the argument.\n8. It enters an infinite loop with the `for(;;)` statement.\n9.
