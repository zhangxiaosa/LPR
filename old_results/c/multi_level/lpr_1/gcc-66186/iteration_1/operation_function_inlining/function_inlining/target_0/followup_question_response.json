Inside the function, there is an array of shorts named `ak` with a size of 8.\n3. The function contains nested loops: the outer loop iterates `p2` from 0 to 7, and the inner loop iterates `p4` from 0 to 7.\n4. Inside the inner loop, there is an if condition that checks if the global variable `h` is less than 0. If true, there's another inner loop that iterates `p4` from 0 to 7.\n5. Inside the second inner loop, there's an if condition that checks if `ak[p3]` is truthy. If true, it breaks out of the loop.\n6.
