In the given code, the target for optimization is the `if (i)` statement within the `fn4()` function.\n\n2. To optimize this loop out via loop unrolling, we need to determine the value of `i` at compile-time. If `i` can be assigned a constant value, the loop can be unrolled based on that value.\n\n3. However, in the given code, the value of `i` is not defined or initialized explicitly. This makes it difficult to determine the loop unrolling factor.\n\n4. To optimize the code further, we can remove the unused variables and statements within the `fn3()` function. Specifically, the `int l` variable and the second `printf(\"l_1179=%d\\n\", l)` statement can be removed as they don't affect the program's behavior.\n\n5.
