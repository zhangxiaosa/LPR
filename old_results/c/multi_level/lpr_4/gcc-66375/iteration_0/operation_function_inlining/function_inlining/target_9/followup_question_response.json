Inlining means replacing the function call with the actual code of the function to eliminate the overhead of the function call. Here's the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. Identify the target function to be optimized: `fn8`.\n\n2. Identify the function calls to `fn8` within the program and inline them.\n\n3. There are no direct calls to `fn8` in the given program. Therefore, no inlining is required for the target function.\n\n4. The `main()` function calls `fn11()`. We need to inline the code of `fn11()` into `main()`.\n\n   The code of `fn11()` can be directly placed within `main()` as follows:\n   ```c\n   int main() {\n     int i, j;\n     int f = 0;\n     \n     // Inlined code of fn11()\n     {\n       typedef char a;\n       typedef short c;\n       typedef int d;\n       typedef unsigned e;\n       typedef unsigned f;\n       typedef unsigned g;\n       \n       a a = 0xFBL;\n       {\n         e c = 255UL;\n         d d = 2L;\n         for (; u < 51; ++u) {\n           g e[9];\n           int i;\n           for (i = 0; i < 9; i++)\n             e[i] = 0x9EE7F9D1C772505BLL;\n           d = fn4(fn2(v[0][3] = fn3(4L, d), 3), e[0]);\n         }\n       }\n     }\n \n     for (i = 0; i < 1; i++)\n       for (j = 0; j < 4; j++)\n         p = v[i][j];\n     printf(\"checksum = %X\\n\", p);\n     return 0;\n   }\n   ```\n\n5. Remove the prototype and definition of the `fn11()` function from the program since it has been inlined.\n\n   The final program after inlining the target function is as follows:\n\n   ```c\n   #include <stdio.h>\n   \n   typedef char a;\n   typedef short c;\n   typedef int d;\n   typedef unsigned e;\n   typedef unsigned f;\n   typedef unsigned g;\n   \n   a fn2(a p1, int p2) { return p1; }\n   \n   c fn3(c p1, c p2) { return p2; }\n   \n   g fn4(g p1, g p2) { return p1 + p2; }\n   \n   f p;\n   f t;\n   g u;\n   g v[1][4];\n   \n   int main() {\n     int i, j;\n     int f = 0;\n     \n     // Inlined code of fn11()\n     {\n       a a = 0xFBL;\n       {\n         e c = 255UL;\n         d d = 2L;\n         for (; u < 51; ++u) {\n           g e[9];\n           int i;\n           for (i = 0; i < 9; i++)\n             e[i] = 0x9EE7F9D1C772505BLL;\n           d = fn4(fn2(v[0][3] = fn3(4L, d), 3), e[0]);\n         }\n       }\n     }\n     \n     for (i = 0; i < 1; i++)\n       for (j = 0; j < 4; j++)\n         p = v[i][j];\n     printf(\"checksum = %X\\n\", p);\n     return 0;\n   }\n   ```\n\n6.
