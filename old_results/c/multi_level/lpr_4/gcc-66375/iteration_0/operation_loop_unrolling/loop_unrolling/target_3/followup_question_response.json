Loop unrolling is a loop optimization technique that aims to reduce loop overhead by executing multiple loop iterations in a single iteration.\n\nHere's the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. The original loop iterates from 0 to 4, with an increment of 1.\n2. We can unroll the loop by performing multiple iterations in a single iteration, reducing the number of iterations.\n3. Unrolling the loop by a factor of 2 would result in two iterations in each loop iteration.\n4. We'll modify the loop control variable `j` by incrementing it by 2 in each iteration.\n5. We'll access the array `v[0]` using the modified loop control variable to get the elements `v[0][j]` and `v[0][j + 1]`.\n6. We'll assign these elements to the variable `p`.\n7. The loop will iterate from 0 to 2 (inclusive), performing two iterations in each iteration.\n8.
