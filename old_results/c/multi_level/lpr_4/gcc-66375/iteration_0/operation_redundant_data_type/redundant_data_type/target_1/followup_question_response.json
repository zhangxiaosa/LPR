The function can remain as is since the return type and parameter types match the original data types.\n   b. `short fn3(short p1, short p2)` returns a `short` and takes two `short` parameters. The function can remain as is since the return type and parameter types match the original data types.\n   c. `unsigned fn4(unsigned p1, unsigned p2)` returns an `unsigned` and takes two `unsigned` parameters.

The assignment can remain as is since the data type matches the original data type.\n   g. The function returns `0`, which can remain as is since the data type matches the original data type.\n\n5. The program defines the `main` function:\n   a. It calls the `fn11` function, which can remain as is since the function call matches the original data type.\n   b. It assigns the value of `v[0][3]` to variable `p`. The assignment can remain as is since the data types match the original data types.\n   c. It uses `printf` to print the value of `p`.
