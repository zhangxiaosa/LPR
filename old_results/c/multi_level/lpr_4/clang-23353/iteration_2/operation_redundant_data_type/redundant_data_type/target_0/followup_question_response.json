The target to be optimized is `char`. We need to eliminate the function `fn1` and substitute every instance of `char` with its associated original data type.\n\n2. The function `fn1` has a return type and two parameters of type `char`. We can eliminate this function and replace its usage with the actual expression it computes, which is `p1 * p2`.\n\n3. Within the `main` function, there is a loop that iterates while `p3` is not equal to `-7`. In each iteration, it decrements `p3` and computes `j_h ^= fn1(p3, i) && 1L`. We will replace `fn1(p3, i)` with the corresponding expression `p3 * i` based on our elimination of the `fn1` function.\n\n4. In the expression `j_h ^= p3 * i && 1L`, we need to substitute `char` with the associated original data type. The original data type for `char` is `signed char`, so we will replace every instance of `char` with `signed char`.\n\n5.
