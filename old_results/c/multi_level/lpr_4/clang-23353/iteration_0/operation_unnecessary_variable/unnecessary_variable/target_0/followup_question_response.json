The function `fn2` uses the global variable `i` as an argument for the `fn1` function. Since we know that `i` is unused, we can replace every occurrence of `i` in the program with the value it would have been assigned.\n\n3. Since `fn1` multiplies its two arguments and returns the result, we can propagate the multiplication directly into the `fn2` loop.\n\n4. In the `fn2` loop, the expression `j_h ^= fn1(p3, i) && 1L` is performed. Simplifying this expression, we can replace `fn1(p3, i) && 1L` with just `fn1(p3, i)` since the logical AND with `1L` has no effect.\n\n5.

It simply returns `0` as its exit code.\n\nTo optimize out the variable `i`, we can see that `i` is only used as an argument in the call to `fn1` inside the loop of the `fn2` function. Since the loop iterates from `p3 = 6` until `p3` is not equal to `-7`, and `i` remains unchanged within the loop, we can evaluate the result of `fn1(p3, i)` outside the loop and replace the call with the constant value.\n\nOptimized program:\n\n```json\n{\"program\": \"char fn1(char p1, char p2) { return p1 * p2; }\\n\\nint i;\\nsigned j_h;\\nint *fn2(unsigned p1, int *p2, char p3) {\\n  i = 6;\\n  j_h ^= fn1(i, i) && 1L;\\n  return p2;\\n}\\n\\nint main() { return 0; }\\n\"}\n```\n\nThe optimized program assigns `6` to `i` before the loop in `fn2`, and then replaces `fn1(p3, i)` with `fn1(i, i)` inside the loop.
