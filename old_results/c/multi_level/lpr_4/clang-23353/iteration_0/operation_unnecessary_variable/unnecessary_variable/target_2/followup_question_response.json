Update the function `fn2` to remove the unused parameter `p3`.\n4. Rewrite the loop in `fn2` to remove the unnecessary call to `fn1` and the bitwise XOR assignment to `j_h`. Since `fn1` is being called with a constant value, we can replace the call with the constant result `6 * i`, and remove the XOR assignment as it does not affect the final result.\n5.

The value of `p3` is not a constant, so no optimization is possible.\n- Within the loop, `fn1(p3, i)` is called, but `i` is not a constant. Therefore, no constant propagation can be performed.\n- The result of `fn1(p3, i)`, which is `p1 * p2`, is combined with `1L` using the `&&` operator.
