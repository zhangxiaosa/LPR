Therefore, `p2` can be considered unused and optimized out.\n\n2. The variable `i` is declared as an integer outside of any function, making it a global variable. However, it is not initialized in the given program. We assume that `i` should have been initialized before being used in the `fn1()` function.\n\n3. The `fn1()` function takes two parameters `p1` and `p2`, multiplies them together, and returns the result.\n\n4. The `main()` function initializes `p3` to 6, and then enters a loop where it decrements `p3` until it reaches -7. Within the loop, it calls the `fn1()` function with `p3` as the first argument and `i` as the second argument. The return value of `fn1()` is then XORed with `j_h` bit-wise and with `1L` (long integer).
