The program starts with the definition of a custom type \"b\" as an alias for int.\n2.

It assigns the value of the field \"e\" from struct \"j\" to the field \"d\" of struct \"l\".\n8. It declares an integer variable \"n\" and assigns it the logical AND of fields \"h\" from struct \"j\" and \"d\" from struct \"l\".\n9. It declares an integer variable \"o\" and assigns it the value of the field \"d\" from struct \"l\".\n10.

It assigns the value of \"p\" to the field \"g\" in struct \"i\".\n12. The main function ends.\n\nTo decompose the program into variables with primary data types, the complex data type \"struct c\" can be decomposed into the following primary data types:\n\n- \"d\" (18-bit signed integer) can be decomposed into an integer or long data type (based on the required range).\n- \"e\" and \"f\" (unsigned integers) can be decomposed into unsigned int or unsigned long data types.\n- \"g\" and \"h\" (signed integers) can be decomposed into int or long data types.\n\nAfter decomposing the program, it will look as follows:\n\n```c\ntypedef int b;\n\nint main() {\n  int l_d = 24;\n  unsigned int l_e = 6738;\n  unsigned int l_f = 165;\n\n  int j_e = 0; // Replace with the appropriate value\n\n  int m = j_e;\n  l_d = j_e;\n  int n = j_h && l_d;\n  int o = l_d;\n  signed int p = o | -(l_f && l_d) - n;\n\n  int i_g = p;\n\n  return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThe variables `l_d`, `l_e`, `l_f`, `j_e`, `m`, `n`, `o`, `p`, `i_g` are the decomposed variables for the respective fields in the original program.
