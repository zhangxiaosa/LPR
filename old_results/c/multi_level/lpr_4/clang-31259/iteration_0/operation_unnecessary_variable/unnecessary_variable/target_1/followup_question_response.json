The target variable to be optimized is `ah`.\n2. Variable `ah` is initialized with the value `3`.\n3. There is a loop `for (w = 1;;)` where no modification is made to `ah`.\n4. Inside the loop, `fn4(fn3(1, fn2(ah, u--)), 4294967295)` is assigned to `v`.

The return value of `fn2(ah, u--)` is passed as an argument to `fn3(1, fn2(ah, u--))`.
