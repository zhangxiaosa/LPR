This syntax indicates that `a_vector` is a vector of `long` values, with the size of each element being the same as the size of the variable `a`.\n\nTo decompose `a_vector` into primary data types, we need to determine the size of `a`. Unfortunately, the variable `a` is not defined in the provided code snippet, so we cannot determine its size.\n\nHowever, if we assume that `a` is a scalar variable, we can decompose `a_vector` into primary data types as follows:\n\n```c\ntypedef long a_vector_element;\n#define VECTOR_SIZE 8 // Assuming 'a' is a scalar with a size of 8 bytes\n\nstruct a_vector {\n  a_vector_element elements[VECTOR_SIZE];\n};\n\na_vector_element fn2_element() {\n  a_vector_element f_element = (a_vector_element)fn1;\n  return f_element;\n}\n\nint main() {\n  a_vector_element f_element = fn2_element();\n  // Use f_element as needed\n  return 0;\n}\n```\n\nIn this version of the program, `a_vector_element` represents a primary data type that is equivalent to the elements of `a_vector`. The decomposed program uses a structure `a_vector` to represent the complex data type, with an array `elements` that holds the individual elements.\n\nThe function `fn2_element` converts the `fn1` function pointer to `a_vector_element` and returns it. The `main` function calls `fn2_element` and assigns the result to `f_element`, which can then be used in the program.\n\nPlease note that the size of `a` is crucial for an accurate decomposition.

The program consists of three functions: `fn1()`, `fn2()`, and `main()`. \n\nTo decompose the complex data type `a_vector` into variables with primary data types, we need to determine the primary data type and size of `a_vector`. From the `typedef` declaration, we see that the size of `a_vector` is determined by `sizeof a`, where `a` is a variable of unknown type.
