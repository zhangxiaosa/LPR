The function `fn1` has no references to `a`, so we can conclude that `a` is unused and optimize it out.\n3. The function `fn2` returns a variable of type `a_vector`, which is a vector with the size of `sizeof a` (the size of `long`). The function assigns the address of `fn1` to a variable `f` of type `a_vector` and then returns `f`.\n   - Constant propagation: Since `fn1` is a function, and we don't have any information about its implementation, we cannot propagate the constant value of `fn1` into `fn2` and optimize `a` out.\n   - Copy propagation: The variable `f` is only assigned the address of `fn1`. Since `fn1` has no references to `a`, we can conclude that `f` also has no references to `a`. Therefore, we can optimize out `a` in the `fn2` function.\n4.
