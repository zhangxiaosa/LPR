Here's the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. In the `fn3` function, the variable `p1` is passed as an argument to `fn2` function. Since `p1` is not used anywhere else in `fn3`, we can optimize it out by removing the parameter `p1` from the function signature and the function call.\n\n   Updated `fn3` function:\n   ```cpp\n   unsigned fn3() {\n     unsigned char q[7][7];\n     struct i r;\n     unsigned s;\n     if (fn2(r, s, q[0][0]))\n       ;\n     return p1;\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. In the `fn2` function, the variable `p1` is used as an argument for the `fn1` function call. The result of `fn1` is then used in the assignment `w = ... && p2.k`. Since `p1` is not used anywhere else in `fn2`, we can optimize it out by evaluating the constant value of `fn1(p1, 2)` and replacing `w = ... && p2.k` with the constant value.\n\n   Updated `fn2` function:\n   ```cpp\n   struct i fn2(struct i p2, unsigned p3, short p4) {\n     struct i v = {0x15L, -5L};\n     int w;\n     int a;\n     if (p4 ^ v.k)\n       ;\n     else\n       v = n[1];\n     for (; w; w += 1)\n       for (p3 = 0; p3 <= 39; ++p3)\n         for (p2.j = 0; p2.j <= 2; p2.j += 1) {\n           n[0] = v;\n           v.l = m[p2.j];\n           if (!n[0].j)\n             ;\n           else {\n             w = (n[0].l > 2) && p2.k;\n             for (; a; a += 1)\n               n[0] = v;\n           }\n         }\n     return p2;\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. In the `fn1` function, the expression `p1 > p2 ? p1 : p1 << p2` can be simplified since `p1` is an unsigned type. If `p2` is non-negative, `p1 << p2` is equivalent to multiplying `p1` by 2 raised to the power of `p2`. So we can optimize the expression by replacing `p1 << p2` with `p1 * (1 << p2)`.\n\n   Updated `fn1` function:\n   ```cpp\n   char fn1(unsigned p1, int p2) {\n     return p1 > p2 ? p1 : p1 * (1 << p2);\n   }\n   ```\n\n4.
