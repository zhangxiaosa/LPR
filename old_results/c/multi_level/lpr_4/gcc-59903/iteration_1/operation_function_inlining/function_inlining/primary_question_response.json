Following the structure definition, there is an array declaration `unsigned m[4]`.\n4. Next, there is an array declaration `struct i n[2]`.\n5. After that, there is the function `fn2(int p1, struct i p2, unsigned p3, short p4)`.\n6. Inside `fn2`, there is a structure variable `v` with two initial values: `{0x15L, -5L}`.\n7. In `fn2`, there are two integer variables `w` and `a`.\n8. The next section in `fn2` contains an `if-else` statement.\n9. Inside the `if` block, there is an empty statement `;`.\n10.
