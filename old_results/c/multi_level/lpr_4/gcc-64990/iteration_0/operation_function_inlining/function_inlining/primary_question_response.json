The program defines the function fn1 with parameters of types a, b, c, and a. This function updates an element of the array m and returns the value 2.\n\n11. The program defines the function fn2 with a parameter of type c. This function declares a local 3D array v, initializes a variable w, and includes several code blocks with conditional statements and loops.\n\n12.
