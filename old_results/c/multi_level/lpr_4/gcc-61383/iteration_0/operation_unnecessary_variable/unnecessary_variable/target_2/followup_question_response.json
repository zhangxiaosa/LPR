Start by analyzing the `fn6` function since it contains the usage of the target variable `p1`.\n\n2. In the `fn6` function, the variable `p1` is passed as an argument to the function `fn1(o, o)`. Therefore, we need to analyze the behavior of `fn1` to determine the optimized value of `p1`.\n\n3. The `fn1` function returns `p2 == 0 ? p1 : p1 % p2`. Since `p2` is not 0, the expression simplifies to `p1 % p2`. Therefore, we can propagate the value of `p1` to the `fn1` call.\n\n4. In the `fn6` function, after the `fn1` call, the value of `ab` is assigned `p1 % p2`. Since `p1` is the same as `p1` from the `fn1` call, we can propagate the value of `p1` to `ab`.\n\n5. The if-else conditions in the `fn6` function do not affect the value of `p1` directly, so we can continue with the analysis.\n\n6.

In the function `fn3(int p1, int p2)`, `p1` is used in a complex condition to determine the return value. It is also used as one of the cases in the ternary operator.\n\nIn the `fn6()` function, `fn1(o, o)` is assigned to the variable `ab`. The value of `ab` is then compared with 6. Since the variable `p1` is passed as the argument `o`, we need to analyze the usage of `o` as well.\n\nConsidering the entire program, `o` is only used in one place: `fn1(o, o)`. Therefore, we can optimize out the variable `p1`, which is equivalent to `o` in this case, by performing constant propagation. We can replace all occurrences of `p1` with its constant value, `o`.

In the function `fn1`, `p1` is used to compute the result based on the value of `p2`. Since `p1` is still required, we cannot optimize it out in this function.\n\n3. In the function `fn3`, `p1` is used in multiple conditional statements. To optimize it out, we need to investigate each statement:\n\n   a. `p1 && p2 && p1 > 2147483647 - p2`: This condition checks if `p1` and `p2` are both true and if `p1` is greater than `2147483647 - p2`. If any of these conditions is false, the condition evaluates to false, and `p1` is not used. Therefore, we can optimize out `p1` in this condition.\n\n   b. `p1 < 0 && p2 < 0 && p1`: This condition checks if `p1` and `p2` are both negative and `p1` is true. If either of the first two conditions is false or if `p1` is false, the condition evaluates to false, and `p1` is not used. Therefore, we can optimize out `p1` in this condition.\n\n   After optimizing out `p1` in both conditions, the result of the entire expression `p1 && p2 && p1 > 2147483647 - p2 || p1 < 0 && p2 < 0 && p1` will be the same as `p2 && p1 > 2147483647 - p2`.\n\n4. In the function `fn6`, the loop iterates as long as `n` is less than 12. Inside the loop, the variable `ab` is assigned the value of `fn1(o, o)`. We've already determined that `p1` can be optimized out in `fn1`, so the assignment becomes `ab = o`. Since `ab` is not used later, we can optimize out the assignment statement and remove the variable `ab`.\n\n   Additionally, the conditional statement `o <= 0xE3L` does not depend on `p1`, so we don't need to modify it.\n\n5.
