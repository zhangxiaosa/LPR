The target to be optimized is the `goto w;` statement inside the `fn1` function.\n\n2. Loop unrolling is a technique used to optimize loops by reducing the overhead of loop control statements. In this case, the loop consists of a single statement `goto w;`, which results in an infinite loop.\n\n3. To optimize out the loop, we can remove the loop control statement and replace it with multiple iterations of the loop body.\n\n4. Since the loop has no effect and will run indefinitely, we can simply remove it. Therefore, the optimized version of `fn1` will become:\n\n   ```c\n   static struct h fn1(unsigned p3, struct h p5) {\n     p5.k;\n   }\n   ```\n\n5. In the `fn2` function, `fn1(q, p)` is called without any effect. We can also remove this line of code.\n\n6.

Therefore, we can remove the loop entirely.\n\n2. Instead of the loop, let's replace the \"goto w;\" statement with an equivalent instruction that jumps to the beginning of the loop.
