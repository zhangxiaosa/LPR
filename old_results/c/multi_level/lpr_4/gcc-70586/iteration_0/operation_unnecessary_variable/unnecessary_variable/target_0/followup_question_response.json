Here's the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. In the `fn3` function:\n   - The condition `if (i)` is encountered twice. Since `i` is a global variable and its value is not modified within the function, we can replace the condition with its constant value. If `i` is true, the first `printf` statement will be executed, and if `i` is false, the first `printf` statement will be skipped.\n   - The assignment `p1 = (0x60781BCD >= m ^ 4294967287UL) - o;` depends on `i`, but its result is not used within the function. Therefore, we can eliminate this assignment since it has no side effects.\n\n2. In the `fn4` function:\n   - The condition `if (fn3(1))` checks the return value of `fn3(1)` but does not use it.
