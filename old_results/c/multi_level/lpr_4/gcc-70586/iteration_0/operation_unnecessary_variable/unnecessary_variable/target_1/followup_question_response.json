After removing the variable `l`, we can see that the second `printf` statement in `fn3` is now unnecessary and can be removed as well.\n4. In the `fn4` function, the result of `fn3(1)` is used in an `if` statement. However, the value of `l` does not affect the result, so its removal does not affect the program's behavior.\n5.

The variable `l` is declared in the `fn3()` function but is not assigned a value.\n4. The `printf` statements inside the `if (i)` blocks require the value of `l`, so we cannot remove those statements.\n5. Since `l` is never assigned a value, it is unused. We can optimize it out by removing its declaration from the `fn3()` function.\n6. After removing the unused `l` variable, the modified `fn3()` function looks like this:\n\n```c\nunsigned fn3(p1) {\n  short m = 0x809C;\n  unsigned o = 0xE576516E;\n  if (i)\n    printf(\"l_1179=%d\\n\", l);\n  p1 = (0x60781BCD >= m ^ 4294967287UL) - o;\n  if (i)\n    printf(\"l_1179=%d\\n\", l);\n  return p1;\n}\n```\n\n7.
