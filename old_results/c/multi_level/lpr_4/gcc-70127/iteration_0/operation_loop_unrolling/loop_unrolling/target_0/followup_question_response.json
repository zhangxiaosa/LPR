Therefore, we can replace the loop with these two iterations directly.\n\nHere's the step-by-step analysis of the program optimization:\n\n1. Remove the loop `for (; u <= 1; u += 1)` and replace it with the following two iterations:\n   - `u = 0;`\n   - `u = 1;`\n\n2. Modify the code inside the loop accordingly.
