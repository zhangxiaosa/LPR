Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. The program declares the variables `f_d` and `f_e` as integers.\n2. The program defines a function `fn1()` that returns a `char`.\n3. Inside `fn1()`, there is an `if` statement checking the value of `f_e`.\n4. If `f_e` is non-zero, the program jumps to the label `i`.\n5. If `f_e` is zero, the program recursively calls `fn1()`.\n6. After the `if` statement, the program returns a constant value regardless of the path.\n7. At the label `i`, the program assigns the value `6` to `f_d`.\n8. The program then recursively calls `fn1()` again.\n9. Finally, the program returns another constant value regardless of the path.\n10. The `main()` function does not contain any code.\n\nNow, let's optimize out the variable `f_d` based on the analysis above:\n\n1. Since `f_d` is assigned a constant value of `6` at the label `i`, we can propagate this constant value throughout the program.\n2. The assignment `f_d = 6L;` can be replaced with the constant value `6` in all other occurrences of `f_d`.\n3. Since there are no other occurrences of `f_d` in the program, it becomes effectively unused.\n4.
