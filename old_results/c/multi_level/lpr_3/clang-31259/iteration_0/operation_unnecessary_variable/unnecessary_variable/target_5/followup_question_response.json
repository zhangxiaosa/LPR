In the `fn4` function, the expression `fn4(p1, p2)` returns `p1 % p2`. Since `p2` is the target variable to be optimized, we replace `p2` with its value wherever it is used.\n\n   ```c\n   int fn4(int p1) { return p1 % p2; }\n   ```\n\n2. In the `fn5` function, the expression `fn5(p1, p2)` returns `p1`. Since `p2` is the target variable to be optimized, we replace `p2` with its value wherever it is used.\n\n   ```c\n   unsigned fn5(unsigned p1) { return p1; }\n   ```\n\n3. In the `fn9` function, the call to `fn4` has the expression `fn4(fn3(1, fn5(255U, fn2(3U, u--))), 4294967295U)`, where `p2` is the target variable to be optimized. We replace `p2` with its value wherever it is used.\n\n   ```c\n   fn4(fn3(1, fn5(255U, fn2(3U, u--))), 4294967295U)\n   ```\n\n   becomes\n\n   ```c\n   fn4(fn3(1, fn5(255U, fn2(3U, u--))), 4294967295U)\n   ```\n\n4.
