The program starts with three `typedef` statements:\n   ```c\n   typedef int b;\n   typedef unsigned c;\n   typedef unsigned d;\n   ```\n\n2. The program declares a variable `g` of type `d`:\n   ```c\n   d g;\n   ```\n\n3.

The program declares a static variable `i` of type `d` and assigns it a value:\n   ```c\n   static d i = 0x06D7L;\n   ```\n\n5.

The program defines the `main` function, which calls `fn2` without using its return value:\n   ```c\n   int main() {\n     fn2();\n   }\n   ```\n\nTo optimize the program by eliminating the `typedef` usage and substituting each instance of type `b` with `int`, perform the following modifications:\n\n1. Replace the `typedef` statement `typedef int b;` with `typedef int b;` to keep the type as `int`.\n\n2.
