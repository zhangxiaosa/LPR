The variable `n` is assigned the value of `g` (`a n = g;`).\n2. There are no other assignments to `n`.\n3. The variable `o` is assigned the value of `n` (`c o = n;`).\n4. The variable `p` is assigned the value of `o` (`e p = o;`).\n5. The value of `p` is used in the assignment `i = p;` inside the loop.\n6. The value of `i` is used in the condition `if (i)` to determine whether to enter the inner loop.\n7. If the condition `if (i)` is true, the value of `m` is used to shift `k` in the assignment `k = k << m;`.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can see that the variable `n` is only used in the assignment `i = p;` and it is not used anywhere else in the program.
