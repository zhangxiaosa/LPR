In the `main` function, several local variables are declared:\n   - `int32_t i`\n   - `int32_t j` initialized with the hexadecimal value `0x24F96B7B`\n   - `uint32_t k`\n   - `int32_t l` initialized with the value `1`\n   - `int32_t m` initialized with the value of `j`\n   - `int32_t n` initialized with the value of `g`\n   - `int32_t o` initialized with the value of `n`\n   - `uint32_t p` initialized with the value of `o`\n5.
