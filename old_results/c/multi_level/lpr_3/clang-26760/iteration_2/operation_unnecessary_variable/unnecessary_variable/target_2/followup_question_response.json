Variable declarations:\n   - `f` and `g` are declared as `int32_t` variables\n   - `i` is declared as an `int32_t` variable\n   - `j` is declared and assigned the value `0x24F96B7B`\n   - `k` is declared as a `uint32_t` variable\n   - `l` is declared and assigned the value `1`\n   - `m` is declared and assigned the value of `j`\n   - `n` is declared and assigned the value of `g`\n   - `o` is declared and assigned the value of `n`\n   - `p` is declared and assigned the value of `o`\n\n2. `for` loop:\n   - The loop initializes `f` to `0`\n   - The condition `f = 0` is always false, so the loop body is never executed\n\n3. Label and shift operation:\n   - There is a label `q`, and it is not used\n\n4. Bit shifting and conditional `goto`:\n   - The variable `k` is right-shifted by the value of `l`, which is `1`\n   - The value of `p` is stored in `i`\n   - If `i` is non-zero, `k` is left-shifted by the value of `m` and the control flow jumps to label `q`\n   - If `i` is zero, the program continues after the `if` statement\n\nBased on the analysis, the variable `n` is assigned the value of `g` but is never used or modified.
