After the typedef statements, the following variables are declared:\n   - \"d f;\" declares a variable \"f\" of type \"d\" (which is equivalent to \"unsigned\").\n   - \"a g;\" declares a variable \"g\" of type \"a\" (which is equivalent to \"signed\").\n   - \"a i;\" declares a variable \"i\" of type \"a\".\n   - \"c j = 0x24F96B7BL;\" declares a variable \"j\" of type \"c\" (which is equivalent to \"int\") and initializes it with the value 0x24F96B7B.\n   - \"e k;\" declares a variable \"k\" of type \"e\" (which is equivalent to \"unsigned\").\n   - \"c l = 1L;\" declares a variable \"l\" of type \"c\" and initializes it with the value 1L.\n   - \"c m = j;\" declares a variable \"m\" of type \"c\" and initializes it with the value of \"j\".\n   - \"a n = g;\" declares a variable \"n\" of type \"a\" and initializes it with the value of \"g\".\n   - \"c o = n;\" declares a variable \"o\" of type \"c\" and initializes it with the value of \"n\".\n   - \"e p = o;\" declares a variable \"p\" of type \"e\" and initializes it with the value of \"o\".\n\n3.
