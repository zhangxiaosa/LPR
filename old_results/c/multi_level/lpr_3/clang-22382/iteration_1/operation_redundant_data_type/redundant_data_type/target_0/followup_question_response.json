Replace every instance of `struct h` with the original data type:\n   - Replace `struct h` with `int` for variable `p5_i` in `fn1`.\n   - Replace `struct h` with `long` for variable `p5_j` in `fn1`.\n   - Replace `struct h` with `unsigned` for variable `p5_k` in `fn1`.\n\n2. Remove the struct definition of `h` and the associated fields `i`, `j`, and `k`.\n\n3. Update the function signatures and return types:\n   - Update the return type of `fn1` from `struct h` to `void`.\n   - Change the parameter type of `fn1` from `struct h` to `unsigned`.\n\n4. Replace the variable declarations with their corresponding optimized data type:\n   - Replace `struct h p;` with `unsigned p;` in `fn2`.\n   - Replace `struct h r;` with `unsigned r;` in the for loop in `fn2`.\n\n5. Remove the assignment operations `p = r = p;` since both variables are of the same data type and can be replaced with `p = r;`.\n\n6. Remove any unnecessary code or statements.
