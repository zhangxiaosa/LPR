Initialize `ak` variable.\n2. Inside the innermost loop, there is a subexpression involving `ak`: `fn8(~(fn3(0, fn2(ap, 1L)) != 0), ak)`.\n   2.1. The constant propagation reveals that `~(fn3(0, fn2(ap, 1L)) != 0)` is always true because `(fn3(0, fn2(ap, 1L)) != 0)` is always false.\n   2.2. Simplifying the expression, we get `fn8(~false, ak)`, which can be further simplified to `fn8(true, ak)`.\n3. Since the result of the expression in step 2 is always `true`, the whole expression `fn8(true, ak)` can be replaced with just `true`.\n4. The condition of the `if` statement becomes `if (w >= (fn7(4UL, fn7(4UL, fn5(ai, au_0[4][1][5] = true && 0x57L))) > 2))`.\n5. The assignment `au_0[4][1][5] = true && 0x57L` can be replaced with `au_0[4][1][5] = false`. This assignment does not affect the outcome.\n6. Simplifying the condition further, we get `if (w >= (fn7(4UL, fn7(4UL, fn5(ai, false))) > 2))`.\n7. Since `w` is a constant `0xDC6F3D13L`, the condition becomes `if (0xDC6F3D13L >= (fn7(4UL, fn7(4UL, fn5(ai, false))) > 2))`.\n8. The expression `(fn7(4UL, fn7(4UL, fn5(ai, false))) > 2)` evaluates to `false` due to the comparison with 2.\n9. Simplifying further, the condition becomes `if (0xDC6F3D13L >= false)`.\n10. Since the comparison is always false, the `else` block is executed always, setting `ao = au_0[4][1][5]`.\n\nFinal optimized program:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"program\": \"#include <stdio.h>\\n\\nunsigned q;\\nint v;\\nunsigned w = 0xDC6F3D13L;\\nlong long ag_3;\\nint ai;\\nint ao;\\nunsigned ap;\\nint fn2(int p1, int p2) { return p1 && p2 ? p1 : p1 % p2; }\\nint fn3(int p1, int p2) { return p2; }\\nint fn5(int p1, int p2) { return p2; }\\nunsigned fn7(unsigned p1, unsigned p2) { return p1; }\\nlong long fn8(int p1, long long p2) { return p1 + p2; }\\n\\nint main() {\\n  int au_0[5][2][10];\\n  for (int ai = 0; ai <= 3; ai += 1) {\\n    if (w >= (fn7(4UL, fn7(4UL, fn5(ai, au_0[4][1][5] = false))) > 2)) {\\n      v = 0x41AEA787L;\\n      ag_3 = au_0[4][1][5];\\n    } else {\\n      ao = au_0[4][1][5];\\n    }\\n  }\\n  q = v;\\n  printf(\\\"checksum = %d\\\\n\\\", q);\\n  return 0;\\n}\\n\"\n}\n```\n\nNote: The program is provided as a JSON object to preserve the formatting and escape characters properly.

However, constant propagation can be applied to simplify the expression `~(fn3(0, fn2(ap, 1L)) != 0)`. The result of this expression will always be `0`, so we can replace it with `0`.\n\n3. After applying constant propagation, the expression becomes `fn8(0, ak)`. Copy propagation can be applied to replace \"ak\" with its value `0`, resulting in `fn8(0, 0)`.\n\n4. The function `fn8` adds its two parameters together, so `fn8(0, 0)` is equivalent to `0 + 0` and can be further simplified to just `0`.\n\n5.

The function `fn8` adds its two arguments `p1` and `p2` and returns the result. The value of `ak` is being added to `p2`, so we cannot replace `ak` with a constant value.\n\n4.

In the `for` loop, `ak` is assigned to `fn8(~(fn3(0, fn2(ap, 1L)) != 0), ak) && 0x57L`.\n\n2. Since `ak` is used as the second argument in the `fn8` function, we cannot replace it with a constant value directly.\n\n3. However, since `fn8` returns the sum of its two arguments, we can simplify the expression to `ak + 0x57L`.\n\n4. The expression `~(fn3(0, fn2(ap, 1L)) != 0)` contains nested function calls, but they do not directly involve `ak`.\n\n5. Therefore, we can propagate the value of `ak` directly into the expression, resulting in `~(0 != 0)`, which is equivalent to `~0`, i.e., `-1`.\n\n6. Continuing the optimization, `fn7(4UL, fn7(4UL, fn5(ai, au_0[4][1][5] = -1 + 0x57L)))` becomes `fn7(4UL, fn7(4UL, fn5(ai, 0x56L)))`.\n\n7. The value `0x56L` is propagated into `au_0[4][1][5]`, so we can replace `au_0[4][1][5]` with `0x56L`.\n\n8. The condition `(w >= fn7(4UL, fn7(4UL, fn5(ai, 0x56L))) > 2)` remains the same.\n\n9. Inside the `if` block, `v` is assigned `0x41AEA787L`, and `ag_3` is assigned `0x56L`.\n\n10. Since `ak` is no longer used after the `if` block, we can remove the `else` block and the assignment to `ao`.\n\n11.
