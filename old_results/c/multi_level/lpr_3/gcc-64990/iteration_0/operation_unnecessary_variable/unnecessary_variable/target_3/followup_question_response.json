The program starts at the `main` function.\n2. The `main` function calls the `fn3` function.\n3. The `fn3` function calls the `fn1` function with arguments `(fn2(0), 7, 7, 0)`.\n4. Inside the `fn1` function, the parameter `p1` is compared with 0 using the logical OR operator (`||`). If `p1` is 0, the expression `(m[1][0][1] = 0)` is evaluated (assignment of 0 to `m[1][0][1]`).\n5. The `fn1` function returns the constant value 2.\n6. The `fn3` function returns the value of the variable `n`.\n7. The `fn2` function is called with argument 0.\n8. Inside the `fn2` function, there is a loop with an unconditional break statement if `k` is non-zero. The loop variable `i` is initially set to 0.\n9. If `k` is non-zero, the function returns the value at index `[g][l + 1][l]` of the `v` array.\n10. If `h` is non-zero, the function does nothing. Otherwise, it returns the value at index `[g][g]` of the `j` array.\n11. The `fn2` function returns the value of the variable `w`.\n12.
