Here are the step-by-step changes to achieve the optimization:\n\n1. In function `fn1`, the statement `m[1][0][1] = 0` is unnecessary since it doesn't affect the final result. Thus, we can remove this statement.\n```cpp\nunsigned fn1(signed p1, short p2, int p3, signed p4) {\n  p1 || (m[1][0][1] = 0);\n  return 2;\n}\n```\n\n2. In function `fn2`, the expression `v[g][l + 1][l]` can be simplified using constant propagation and copy propagation since `g` and `l` are constants. We replace `g` with its constant value `0x7EBA` and `l` with its constant value `0`.\n```cpp\nsigned fn2(p1) {\n  unsigned v[6][3][2];\n  for (i = 0;;) {\n    if (k)\n      break;\n    return v[0x7EBA][1][0];\n  }\n  if (h)\n    ;\n  else\n    return j_new[g][g];\n  for (; p1;) {\n  }\n  return 0x709BFC8A;\n}\n```\n\n3.
