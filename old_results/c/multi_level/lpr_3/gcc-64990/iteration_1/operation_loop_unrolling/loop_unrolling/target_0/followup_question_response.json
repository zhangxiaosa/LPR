Initialization: `i = 0`\n2. Loop condition: No explicit loop condition is given, so the loop runs indefinitely until it's exited via the `break` statement.\n3. Loop body: `if (k) break; return v[g][l + 1][l];`\n\nTo perform loop unrolling, we need to replace the loop with the unrolled version.

Loop unrolling is a technique that duplicates loop iterations, reducing the overhead of incrementing the loop counter and condition checking.\n\nIn this case, since the loop condition is `true`, we can unroll the loop by manually duplicating the loop body multiple times.
