If it is not used anywhere, we can safely remove it. In this case, `v_1[6][3][2]` is not used anywhere else, so we can optimize it out.\n\n2. Remove the declaration and initialization of `v_1` since it is no longer being used.\n\n3. Remove the if-else statement because the condition `if (i)` is no longer necessary.
