Replace the typedef `typedef short f;` with `typedef long c;` since `f` is being eliminated.\n\n3. Replace the variable declarations and function signatures using `f` with `short`. For example, `f fn6(f p1, f p2)` becomes `short fn6(short p1, short p2)` and `f p;` becomes `short p;`.\n\n4. In the function `fn6`, replace the return type `f` with `short`.\n\n5.

In the function `fn10`, replace the parameter `g` with `unsigned` and the return type `unsigned` with `unsigned`.\n\n7. Replace the variable declarations `f u;` with `short u;`, `long v;` with `long v;`, and `short w;` with `short w;`.\n\n8. Replace the constant `1L` with `1` and `1UL` with `1`.\n\n9.
