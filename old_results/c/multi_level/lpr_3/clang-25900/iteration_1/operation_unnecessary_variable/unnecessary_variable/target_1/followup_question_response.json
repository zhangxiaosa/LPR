Since `ae` is assigned the value of `ad.o`, which is modified in the line `ad.o = fn1(5, 5);`, we need to determine the constant value of `ad.o` after this assignment.\n\n2. The function `fn1` is defined as `unsigned fn1(unsigned p1, int p2) { return p2; }`. In the call `ad.o = fn1(5, 5);`, the second argument `p2` is a constant with a value of 5, so we can replace `ad.o` with 5.\n\n3. After replacing `ad.o` with 5, the assignment `ae = ad.o;` becomes `ae = 5;`.\n\n4. The variable `ae` is only used in the expression `r = t % (~s / ae);`. Since `ae` has the constant value of 5, we can substitute `ae` with 5 in this expression.\n\n5.
