Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. The variable `u` is not used anywhere in the program, so it can be safely removed.\n\n2. The function `fn1` takes two parameters but only returns `p2` as an unsigned integer. It does not have any side effects on the program. Since the return value of `fn1` is assigned to `ad.o`, we can replace the function call with its constant argument `5`.\n\n3. Since the variable `ad.o` is assigned a constant value `5` after the previous optimization, we can replace the assignment `ae = ad.o` with `ae = 5`.\n\n4. The assignment `ad.o = u` can be removed as `u` is already optimized out.\n\n5. The expression `(~s / ae)` evaluates to a constant value since `s` is a constant `-5` and `ae` is `5` after the previous optimization. Therefore, we can replace the expression `t % (~s / ae)` with a constant value.\n\n6.

The second occurrence of `u` is in the line `r = t % (~s / ae);`. Here, `u` is not involved in the computation of `r`. Therefore, the expression `~s / ae` can be simplified without considering the value of `u`.\n4. The simplified expression `~s / ae` can be further simplified using constant propagation. Assuming `ae` equals 5 and `s` equals -5, the expression becomes `~(-5) / 5 = 4 / 5 = 0`. So the simplified expression is `0`.\n5.
