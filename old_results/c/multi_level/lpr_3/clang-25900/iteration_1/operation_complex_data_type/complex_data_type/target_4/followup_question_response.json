The program begins with the declaration of a function named \"fn1\" with an unsigned integer parameter \"p1\" and an integer parameter \"p2\". The return type of the function is unsigned integer. The function body simply returns the value of \"p2\".\n\n   ```c\n   unsigned fn1(unsigned p1, int p2) {\n     return p2;\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. Next, a structure named \"m\" is defined, which contains two signed integer bit-fields named \"n\" and \"o\" with sizes of 18 and 1 respectively.\n\n   ```c\n   struct m {\n     signed n : 18;\n     signed o : 1;\n   };\n   ```\n\n3.

The main function is defined, which has the signature \"int main()\".
