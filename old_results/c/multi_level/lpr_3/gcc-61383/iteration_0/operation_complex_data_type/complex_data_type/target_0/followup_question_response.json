Declare the function `fn1` with two parameters of type `signed`:\n```c\nsigned fn1(signed p1, signed p2) {\n    return p2 == 0 ? p1 : p1 % p2;\n}\n```\n\n2.

The program starts with three function definitions:\n   - `fn1` takes two signed integers as parameters and returns the remainder of `p1` divided by `p2`.\n   - `fn2` takes a short integer and an int as parameters and returns the value of `p1`.\n   - `fn3` takes two int parameters and returns the result of a complex conditional expression.\n\n2. The program defines several variables:\n   - `m` and `n` are unsigned integers.\n   - `o` is a signed integer.\n   - `p` is a static unsigned integer with a hex value.\n   - `ab` is an integer variable defined inside the main loop block.\n\n3.
