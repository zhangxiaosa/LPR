The program declares two variables `fd` and `fe` of type `int`.\n2. It defines a function named `fn1` with a return type of `char`.\n3. Inside the `fn1` function, there is an `if` condition that checks the value of `fe`. If `fe` is non-zero, it assigns the value 6L to `fd` (converting it to a `long`), calls the `fn1` function recursively, and returns 0.\n4. After the `if` condition, there is a recursive call to the `fn1` function.\n5. The `fn1` function always returns 0 regardless of the `if` condition.\n6.
