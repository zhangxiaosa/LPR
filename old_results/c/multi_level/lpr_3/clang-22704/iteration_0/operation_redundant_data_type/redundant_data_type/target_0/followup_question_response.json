In the given program, the data type `a` is defined as `typedef int a`. We need to eliminate this definition and substitute every instance of `a` with its associated original data type, which is `int`.\n\n2. In the struct `c`, the member variables `d` and `e` are of type `a`. We need to replace them with `int`, so the struct definition becomes:\n```c\nstruct c {\n  int d;\n  int e;\n};\n```\n\n3. The variable `f` is an instance of struct `c`. Since the struct definition has been modified in step 2, we need to update the declaration of `f` accordingly:\n```c\nstruct c f;\n```\n\n4. In the function `fn1()`, the variable `h` is declared with type `a`. We need to change it to `int`:\n```c\nint h = 6L;\n```\n\n5. Inside the `if` condition, `f.e` is used. Since `e` is now of type `int`, no change is required.\n\n6. The function `fn1()` is recursively called within itself. There is no optimization required here.\n\n7. The variable `j` is declared with type `b`. We need to replace it with `char`:\n```c\nchar j;\n```\n\n8. Inside the `i` label, the assignment `f.d = h` is performed. As `d` is now of type `int`, no change is required.\n\n9. The value assigned to `j` is specified as `0xEEACFBBFL`. Since `j` is now of type `char`, we need to modify it to `0xEEACFBBF`:\n```c\nj = 0xEEACFBBF;\n```\n\n10.
