Loop unrolling is a technique that allows us to reduce branch instructions and exploit instruction-level parallelism.\n\nHere's the step-by-step analysis of the program optimization:\n\n1. The initial program contains a loop nested within another loop, and the target condition `if (h < 0)` is inside the inner loop. The goal is to optimize this condition.\n2. In this case, loop unrolling can be applied to the inner loop. Loop unrolling involves duplicating the loop body multiple times and adjusting the loop control variable accordingly.\n3. To remove the condition `if (h < 0)` from the loop, we can replace the inner loop with eight instances of its loop body, each with a fixed value for the loop control variable `p4`.\n4. Since the loop control variable `p4` is being used as the index for accessing `ak`, we need to ensure that the values of `p4` used in the loop body match the original code's behavior. This involves setting `p4 = 0` in the first iteration and incrementing it by 1 in subsequent iterations.\n5.
