Initialize a new unsigned variable `m_opt` and assign it the initial value of `m`, which is `unsigned m_opt[4] = {0, 0, 0, 0};`.\n\n2. Replace every occurrence of `m` with `m_opt` in the program.\n\n3. The innermost loop assigns `v` the value of `m_opt[r]`. As `m_opt` is constant and does not change within the loop, we can directly assign `v` the constant value of `m_opt[r]`. Modify the assignment statement to `v = 0` if `r` is 0, `v = 0` if `r` is 1, and `v = 0` if `r` is 2.\n\n4. The assignment `n0 = v` is redundant as `n0` is never used afterward in the loop. We can remove this assignment statement.\n\n5. The assignment `w = n0 && k` is also redundant as `w` is never used afterward in the loop. We can remove this assignment statement.\n\n6.
