Since `r` is only used within the nested loops, we can conclude that its value is not used outside of the loops.\n2. We notice that the value of `r` is initialized to 0 before entering the loops and then incremented by 1 in each iteration of the outer loop.\n3. Since the loop condition `r <= 2` ensures that `r` will only take the values 0, 1, and 2, we can determine that the loop will execute exactly 3 times for each iteration of the middle loop.\n4. Therefore, within each iteration of the middle loop, the value of `r` will be 0, 1, or 2, but it will not be used after that specific iteration.\n5. Since the value of `r` is not used after each iteration of the middle loop, we can propagate the constant values of 0, 1, and 2 directly into the inner loop without the need for a variable.\n6. After performing copy propagation, the inner loop will look like this:\n   ```\n   for (; a; a += 1)\n     n0 = 0u;\n   ```\n7. Since `r` is no longer needed, we can remove its declaration and initialization from the program.\n8. Since the variable `v` is not used outside of the loops, and the loop condition `w = n0 && k` is dependent on `n0`, we can also remove the unused variable `v`.\n9.
