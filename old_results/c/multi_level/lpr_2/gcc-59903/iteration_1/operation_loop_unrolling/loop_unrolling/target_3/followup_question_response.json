To optimize the loop, we can unroll it by manually repeating the loop body multiple times.\n4. Since the loop iterates from 0 to 39, we can divide it into multiple iterations, each covering a smaller range. Let's say we divide it into 4 iterations, each covering a range of 10.\n5. We create four copies of the loop body, each with the loop variable `s` incremented by 10 in each iteration.\n6. We update the loop termination condition to reflect the reduced range for each iteration.\n7. We adjust the loop variable initialization to match the new range.\n8. We modify the loop iteration statement to increment the loop variable by 10 in each iteration.\n9. We update the loop bounds in the other nested loops as necessary.\n10.
