Constant propagation cannot be applied to `m` directly unless we have additional information.\n   - If we have known constant values for `m` at compile-time, we can replace all occurrences of `m` with its constant value.

We can replace `m[r]` with the values it takes on each iteration, which are `m[0]`, `m[1]`, and `m[2]`.
