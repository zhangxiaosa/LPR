The variable `ap` is used as an argument in the function call `fn2(ap, 1L)`.\n2. From the definition of `fn2`, the expression `p1 && p2 ? p1 : p1 % p2` evaluates to `p1 % p2` when `p1 && p2` is false and `p1` when `p1 && p2` is true.\n3. Since `1L` is always non-zero, `p1 && p2` will always be true. Therefore, the function call `fn2(ap, 1L)` is equivalent to `ap % 1`.\n4. The expression `ap % 1` is always zero, as any number modulo 1 is always zero.\n5. The expression `~(fn2(ap, 1L) != 0)` is equivalent to `~(0 != 0)`, which simplifies to `~0`.\n6. The expression `~0` is equal to `-1`.\n7. The expression `~0 + ak && 0x57L` is equivalent to `-1 + ak && 0x57L`.\n8.
