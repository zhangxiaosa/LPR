This reduces the overhead of the loop control and improves performance.\n\nSince the loop condition `l` remains the same throughout the loop, we can unroll the loop by a fixed number of iterations. Let's say we decide to unroll it by 4 iterations, the modified loop would look like this:\n\n```c\nfor (; l >= 4; l -= 4) {\n  // Loop body unrolled 4 times\n  p1 = o - p1;\n  p1 = o - p1;\n  p1 = o - p1;\n  p1 = o - p1;\n}\n\n// Handle remaining iterations (less than 4)\nswitch (l) {\n  case 3:\n    p1 = o - p1;\n  case 2:\n    p1 = o - p1;\n  case 1:\n    p1 = o - p1;\n}\n```\n\nBy unrolling the loop, we reduce the loop control overhead and eliminate unnecessary loop checks.
