However, `p3` is passed as a variable, so it cannot be replaced with a constant.\n\nStep 3: Copy Propagation\nIf `p3` is unused after the modifications, we can optimize it out by replacing all its uses with the corresponding arguments.\n\n- In `fn4`, the loop condition `if (ak[p3])` depends on `p3`. We need to replace `p3` with the corresponding value passed as the argument.\n\nStep 4: Final Program\n\n```json\n{\"program\": \"int g;\\nint h;\\nunsigned fn4(unsigned short, unsigned short, unsigned, unsigned short);\\n\\nint fn5() {\\n  if (fn4(4294967287UL, -7L, g, g))\\n    ;\\n  return 0xA3L;\\n}\\n\\nunsigned fn4(unsigned short p2, unsigned short p3, unsigned p4,\\n             unsigned short p5) {\\n  short ak[8];\\n  for (p2 = 0; p2 <= 7; p2 += 1)\\n    for (p4 = 0; p4 <= 7; p4 += 1)\\n      if (h < 0)\\n        for (p4 = 0; p4 <= 7; p4 += 1)\\n          if (ak[p3])\\n            break;\\n  return g;\\n}\\n\\nint main() { fn5(); }\"}\n```\n\nAfter analyzing the program, we can see that there are no opportunities for constant propagation or further optimization of the variable `p3`.
