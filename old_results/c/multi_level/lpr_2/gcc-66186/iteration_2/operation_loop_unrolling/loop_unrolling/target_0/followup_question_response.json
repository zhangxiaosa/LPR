Loop unrolling is a compiler optimization technique where multiple iterations of the loop are executed in a single iteration. This reduces the overhead of loop control and improves performance.\n\nIn this case, we can unroll the loop by a factor of 2. Instead of executing the loop 8 times, we will execute it 4 times.
