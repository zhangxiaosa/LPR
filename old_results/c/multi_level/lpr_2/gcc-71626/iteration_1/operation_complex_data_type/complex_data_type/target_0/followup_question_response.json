This `d` type appears to be a vector type with the same size as `long`.\n2. Inside `fn2()`, it declares a local variable `c` of type `long` and initializes it with the result of the function `fn1`. However, the body of `fn1` is not provided in the given code snippet.\n3. It then declares another local variable `f` of type `d` and initializes it with the value of `c`.

Finally, it returns the variable `f`, but the main function is left empty.\n\nTo decompose the complex data type `d` into variables with primary data types, we need to know the size and composition of the vector type. Without more information or the definition of `fn1`, it's not possible to determine the exact decomposition.
