Finally, it returns `f`.\n\n`main` is an empty function.\n\nStep 2: Decompose the Complex Data Type\n\nSince the target is to optimize the data type `d` into primary data types, we need to decompose it. `d` has a vector-like behavior with each element of type `long`. We can decompose it by creating multiple variables of type `long`, where each variable represents one element of `d`.\n\nStep 3: Modify the Program\n\nLet's decompose the complex data type `d` into primary data types.
