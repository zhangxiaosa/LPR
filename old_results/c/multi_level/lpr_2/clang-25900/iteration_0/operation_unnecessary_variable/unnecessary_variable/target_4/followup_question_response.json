Since the `fn1` function simply returns the value of `p2`, and `p2` is not used anywhere else in the program, we can optimize it out completely.\n\n3. To optimize `p2` out, we need to modify the `fn1` function. Since the function signature and the return type should remain the same, we can modify the function body to directly return a constant value, which is `p2` in this case.\n\n4. The modified `fn1` function will look like this:\n\n   ```c\n   int fn1(unsigned p1, int p2) {\n       return 5;\n   }\n   ```\n\n5. After modifying the `fn1` function, we can safely remove the unused variable `p2` from the program.\n\n6.
