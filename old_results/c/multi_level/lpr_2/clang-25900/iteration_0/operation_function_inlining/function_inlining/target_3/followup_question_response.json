The `fn1` function is called within `fn4`. To optimize it, we can inline the `fn1` function directly into `fn4`.\n\n2. The `fn4` function uses variables `v`, `t`, `u`, `s`, `r`, `af`, `ae`, `ad`, `z`, which are defined outside the function.\n\n3. It seems that `v`, `t`, `u`, `s`, `r`, `af` have global scope and may be modified by other parts of the program. So their inlining should be handled differently in order to maintain their shared state.\n\n4. The remaining variables `ae`, `ad`, `z` are local variables within `fn4`.\n\n5. By inlining `fn1` into `fn4`, the logic can be rewritten as follows:\n\n```cpp\nd fn4()\n{\n    struct m z;\n    struct m ad = {1957};\n    ad.o = v;  // Inlined fn1(v, 5) by directly assigning v to ad.o\n    a ae;\n    c af = t;  // Copy the value of t to af\n    ae = ad.o;\n    ad.o = u;\n    r = af % (~s / ae);\n    ad.o;  // return the value of ad.o\n}\n```\n\n6.
