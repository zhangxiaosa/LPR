Thus, the assignment becomes `ad.o = 5`.\n\n2. The variable `ae` is assigned the value of `ad.o` (which is now `5`). In this case, `ae` can be replaced by the constant value `5`.\n\n3. The statement `r = t % (~s / ae)` involves the variable `ae`. Since `ae` is now a constant with the value `5`, we can perform constant folding. The expression `~s / 5` can be evaluated at compile-time.\n\n4. Assuming the value of `s` is constant, we can calculate the value of `~s / 5` and replace the expression `~s / 5` with its constant value result.\n\n5.
