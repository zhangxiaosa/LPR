Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. Identify the variables with complex data types:\n   - Variable `j` is an array of type `int`. It has a complex data type.\n   - Variable `m` is a 3-dimensional array of type `unsigned`. It has a complex data type.\n   - Variable `n` is a simple variable of type `int` and does not have a complex data type.\n   - Variable `v` is a 3-dimensional array of type `unsigned` but is only declared and used inside the `fn2` function. It does not need to be included in the list of variables with complex data types.\n   - Other variables (`g`, `h`, `i`, `k`, `l`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `p4`) are either simple variables or function parameters and do not have complex data types.\n\n2.

The program declares three function prototypes:\n   - `unsigned fn1(int, short, int, signed)`\n   - `int fn2(int)`\n   - `unsigned fn3()`\n\n3. The program defines the function `fn3()` which has no parameters. Inside this function, the following actions are performed:\n   - The `fn1` function is called with arguments `fn2(0)`, `7`, `7`, and `0`.\n   - The value of `n` is returned.\n\n4. The program defines the function `fn1(int p1, short p2, int p3, signed p4)` which takes four parameters. Inside this function, the following actions are performed:\n   - If `p1` evaluates to true, the value of `p1` is assigned to `m[1][0][1]`.\n   - The value `2` is returned.\n\n5. The program defines the function `fn2(int p1)` which takes one parameter. Inside this function, the following actions are performed:\n   - Local variable `v` is defined as a 3D array of type `unsigned`.\n   - Local variable `w` is defined as type `int`.\n   - A loop is executed with `i` initialized to `0`.\n   - If `k` evaluates to true, the loop is broken, and the value at `v[g][l + 1][l]` is returned.\n   - If `h` evaluates to true, an empty statement is executed; otherwise, the value at `j[g][g]` is returned.\n   - An empty loop is executed with `p1` as the condition.\n   - The value of `w` is returned.\n\n6. The program defines the `main()` function, which has no parameters. Inside this function, `fn3()` is called.\n\nBased on the analysis, the variables with complex data types are `j`, `m`, and `v`.
