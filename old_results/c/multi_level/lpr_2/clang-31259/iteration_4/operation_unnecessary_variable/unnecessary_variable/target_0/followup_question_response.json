Since the result is not used later, the function call can be optimized out.\n  - `--u`: The variable `u` is decremented by 1 before being used as an argument for `fn4`. This expression can be optimized out if the value of `u` is not used elsewhere.\n  - `ad[w + 1][w][af]`: Accessing the array `ad` with indices `w + 1`, `w`, and `af`. The values of `w` and `af` are known at compile-time, but `w` can change in the loop. If the loop condition `for (af = 6; af >= 0; af -= 1)` is always true, `w` will be set to 1 outside the loop, and the array access can be simplified to `ad[2][1][af]`.\n  - `ai[0] ^= ad[2][1][af]`: `ai[0]` is XORed with `ad[2][1][af]`.
