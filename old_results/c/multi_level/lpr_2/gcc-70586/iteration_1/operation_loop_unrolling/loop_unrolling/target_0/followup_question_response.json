Start by declaring and initializing the `i` variable outside the loop. Since the loop condition `if (i)` depends on the value of `i`, we need to make sure it's initialized before the loop.\n\nUpdated program:\n```c\nint i = 0;\n\nint fn3() {\n  int l;\n  if (i)\n    printf(\"l_1179=%lld\\n\", (long long)l);\n  int temp = 1 ^ 4294967287;\n  int temp2 = 0xE576516E;\n  if (i)\n    printf(\"l_1179=%lld\\n\", (long long)l);\n  return temp - temp2;\n}\n\nint main() {\n  if (fn3())\n    ;\n}\n```\n\n2. Since the loop is now guaranteed to execute only once, we can remove the loop entirely and eliminate the conditional branching.\n\nUpdated program:\n```c\nint i = 0;\n\nint fn3() {\n  int l;\n  printf(\"l_1179=%lld\\n\", (long long)l);\n  int temp = 1 ^ 4294967287;\n  int temp2 = 0xE576516E;\n  printf(\"l_1179=%lld\\n\", (long long)l);\n  return temp - temp2;\n}\n\nint main() {\n  if (fn3())\n    ;\n}\n```\n\n3.
