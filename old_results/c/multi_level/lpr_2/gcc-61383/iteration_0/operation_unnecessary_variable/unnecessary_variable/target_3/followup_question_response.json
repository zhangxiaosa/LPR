The value of `n` depends on the values of `n` and `3` passed to `fn3`. We need to analyze `fn3` to determine if its arguments are constant.\n3. `fn3` contains various conditions and expressions involving the variables `p1` and `p2`. We cannot determine their constant values without further analysis.\n\nTo perform constant propagation and optimize out the variable `n` completely, we need to evaluate all the conditions and expressions involving `n`, `p1`, and `p2`.
