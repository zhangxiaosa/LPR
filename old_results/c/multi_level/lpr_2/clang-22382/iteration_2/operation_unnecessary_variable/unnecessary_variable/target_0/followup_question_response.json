The target variable to be optimized is `p1` in the program.\n\n2. In the `main` function, there are no references or assignments to `p1`, so it can be considered unused and optimized out.\n   \n   The modified `main` function would be:\n\n   ```c\n   int main() {}\n   ```\n\n3. In the `fn1` function, the variable `p1` is passed as an argument but not used. We can optimize it out by removing the parameter and the unused assignment to `p5.k`.\n\n   The modified `fn1` function would be:\n\n   ```c\n   static struct h fn1(struct h p5) {\n     p5.k;\n     w:\n     goto w;\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. In the `fn2` function, `fn1(l, p)` is called, passing `l` and `p` as arguments. Since `p1` is not used in `fn1` and `p` is assigned the value of `r1`, which is also assigned the value of `p`, we can optimize out `p1`.\n\n   The modified `fn2` function would be:\n\n   ```c\n   unsigned fn2() {\n     struct h p;\n     fn1(p);\n     for (;;) {\n       struct h r1;\n       p = r1 = p;\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n5.

The program defines a struct `h` with three members: `i` of type `int`, `j` of type `long`, and `k` of type `unsigned`.\n2. It declares an unsigned variable `l`.\n3. It defines a static function `fn1` that takes an unsigned parameter `p1` and a struct `h` parameter `p5`. Inside the function, there is an unused expression `p5.k`.\n4. The `fn1` function contains an infinite loop defined using a `goto` statement.\n5. It defines another function `fn2` that returns an unsigned value. In this function:\n   - It declares a local variable `p` of type `struct h`.\n   - It calls the `fn1` function with the parameters `l` and `p`.\n   - It enters an infinite loop using a `for` statement.\n     - Inside the loop, it declares a local variable `r1` of type `struct h`.\n     - It assigns the value of `p` to both `r1` and `p`, effectively copying the value of `p` to `r1`.\n6. Finally, the `main` function is empty.\n\nIn this analysis, the specified variable to optimize out is `p1`.\n\nTo optimize `p1` out using constant propagation, we need to examine its usages and replace them with the corresponding constant value `l`:\n\n1. The `fn1` function uses `p1` as a parameter but doesn't perform any operations with it. Since it is unused, we can remove it from the function declaration altogether.\n2. In the `fn2` function, the `fn1` call passes `l` as the first argument to `p1`.
