Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:\n\n1. In the `fn2` function:\n- The loop condition `for (; w; w += 1)` depends on the value of `w`, which is not initialized.\n- The condition `if (!v_j)` determines whether the inner loop is executed or not. Inside the loop, `n_0_l` is modified by assigning `m[p2.j]` to it.\n\n2. In the `fn3` function:\n- The `fn2` function is called with the argument `r` and `q[0][0]`.

Since the value of `p2.j` is constant within that loop (0, 1, or 2), we can propagate the constant value of `m[p2.j]` and replace references to `n_0_l` with the constant value.\n\n2. From the analysis in step 1, we can determine the following constant assignments:\n   - `n_0_l` within the loop where `p2.j = 0` is equivalent to `m[0]`.\n   - `n_0_l` within the loop where `p2.j = 1` is equivalent to `m[1]`.\n   - `n_0_l` within the loop where `p2.j = 2` is equivalent to `m[2]`.\n\n3.
