The value of `p2` is used in the condition `p4 ^ v.k`, but the result of this condition is not assigned to any variable or used in further calculations.\n4.

The target variable to be optimized is `p2` in the `fn2` function.\n\n2. `p2` is used in the expression `w = fn1(n[0].l, 2) && p2.k;` inside the nested loops. The value of `p2.k` is used as a condition for the logical AND operation.\n\n3.

Let's assume the value is `c`.\n\n5.
