The function `fn1` compares p1 and p2. If p1 is greater than p2, it returns p1; otherwise, it performs a left shift of p1 by p2 and returns the result.\n2. In the main function, there are no statements to optimize as it is empty.\n3. The function `fn3` takes an argument p1, declares a 2D array q of type unsigned char, and declares a struct i variable r. Then it calls the function fn2 with arguments p1, r, 0, and q[0][0]. If p1 is true, it does nothing and returns p1.\n4. The function `fn2` takes arguments p1, p2, p3, and p4, and declares variables v_j, w, a. It initializes v_j to 0x15L. Next, it checks if p4 XOR -5L is true. If true, it does nothing; otherwise, it assigns n_1_j to v_j. Then it enters a loop with condition w. Inside the loop, there are nested loops with conditions p3 <= 39 and p2.j <= 2. Within these nested loops, n_0_j is assigned v_j, n_0_k is assigned 5L, and if n_0_j is non-zero, it updates w by calling the function fn1 with arguments n_0_l and 2, and performs a logical AND operation with p2.k. If a is non-zero, it assigns v_j to n_0_j and assigns m[p2.j] to n_0_l. Finally, it returns p2.\n5.

There are several conditions and loops in the program that involve `n_0_j`:\n   - In the loop `for (; w; w += 1)`, `n_0_j` is assigned the value of `v_j` for each iteration.\n   - Inside the loop, if `n_0_j` is non-zero, `w` is assigned the result of the `fn1` function with parameters `n_0_l` and 2, bitwise ANDed with `p2.k`.\n   - Another loop `for (; a; a += 4)` assigns `n_0_j` the value of `v_j` for each iteration.\n   - The value of `n_0_j` is not modified outside these loops.\n\n3. Since `n_0_j` is only influenced by the assignment of `v_j`, we can perform copy propagation by replacing all occurrences of `n_0_j` with `v_j`.\n4.
