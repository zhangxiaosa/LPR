The original loop iterates as long as `a` is non-zero and increments `a` by 4 in each iteration.\n2. We can unroll the loop by determining the number of iterations required to cover the same behavior. Assuming `a` starts with a non-negative value, the loop condition `a` will continue to be true until `a` becomes negative or zero after decrementing by 4 in each iteration.\n3. To unroll the loop, we need to replace the loop with multiple repetitions of the loop body. In this case, we can use a loop body repetition of `a / 4`.\n4. Modify the loop body by replacing `a` with `a + 4 * i` at each occurrence, where `i` is the current repetition number of the loop body.\n5. Update the loop control variables accordingly. We need to introduce a new loop variable `i` to keep track of the current repetition number and modify the loop to iterate `i` from 0 to `a / 4`.\n6.
