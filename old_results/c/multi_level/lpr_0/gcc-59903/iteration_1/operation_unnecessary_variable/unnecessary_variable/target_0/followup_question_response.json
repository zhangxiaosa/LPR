Next, analyze the `fn3` function:\n   - The variable `a` is not present in this function, so it doesn't affect the optimization of `a`.\n\n3. Proceed to analyze the `fn2` function:\n   - Inside the nested loops, the value of `a` is incremented by 4 in each iteration. However, the loop condition `for (; a; a += 4)` depends on the value of `a`, so we cannot statically determine if `a` is eventually zero.\n   - Since the value of `a` cannot be determined statically, we cannot optimize out `a` in this function.\n\n4. Finally, analyze the `fn1` function:\n   - The variable `a` is not present in this function, so it doesn't affect the optimization of `a`.\n\nSince the variable `a` is used in the loop condition of the `fn2` function, we cannot optimize it out in this program.
