In the `fn4` function:\n   a. The variable `ad.o` is assigned the value returned by `fn1(5)`. Since the argument provided to `fn1` is a constant value of `5`, we can replace this assignment with `ad.o = 5`.\n   b. The variable `ae` is assigned the value of `ad.o`. Since we have already simplified `ad.o` to `5`, we can replace this assignment with `ae = 5`.\n   c. The variable `ad.o` is assigned `0`, but this assignment is unnecessary because the value of `ad.o` is not used later in the program. Therefore, we can remove this assignment statement.\n\n4. The variable `r` is updated to `r % (5 / ae)`. Since `ae` is always `5`, the expression simplifies to `r % (5 / 5)`, which further simplifies to `r % (1)`, and finally `r` itself. Therefore, the expression can be replaced with just `r`.\n\n5. The return statement in `fn4` returns the value of `ad.o`, which we have simplified to `5`. This return statement can be replaced with `return 5;`.\n\n6.
