Inside the `fn2()` function:\n   - A local variable `c` of type `long` is declared and assigned the value of the function `fn1`. However, `fn1` is not a function call but just a placeholder in the code.\n   - Another local variable `f` of type `d` is declared and initialized with the value of `c` using an initializer list.\n   - Finally, the `f` vector is returned from the function.\n\n4.

We have also introduced a constant `D_SIZE` to represent the size of the vector `d`.
