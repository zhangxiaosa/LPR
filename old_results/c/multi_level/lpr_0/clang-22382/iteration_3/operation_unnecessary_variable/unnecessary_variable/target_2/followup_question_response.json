Inside the `fn1` function, the statement `p5.k;` accesses the value of the variable `k`, but the result is not used.\n4. The label `w` is defined, and the program uses a `goto` statement to jump to that label, creating an infinite loop.\n5. The `fn2` function has no parameters and returns an `unsigned` value.\n6.
