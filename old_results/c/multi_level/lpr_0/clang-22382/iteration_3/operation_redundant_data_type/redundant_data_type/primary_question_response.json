The program defines a struct called \"original_data_type\" with three members: \"i\" of type int, \"j\" of type long, and \"k\" of type unsigned.\n2. The program declares a static function \"fn1\" with two parameters: \"p1\" of type unsigned and \"p5\" of type struct original_data_type.\n3. Inside the \"fn1\" function, there is a statement that accesses the member \"k\" of the parameter \"p5\".\n4. The \"fn1\" function also contains a label \"w\" and a goto statement that jumps to the \"w\" label. This creates an infinite loop.\n5. The program declares another function \"fn2\" with no parameters, which returns an unsigned integer.\n6. Inside the \"fn2\" function, a local variable \"p\" of type struct original_data_type is declared.\n7. The \"fn2\" function calls the \"fn1\" function with arguments 0 and \"p\".\n8. There is a while loop that loops indefinitely with the condition \"while (1)\".\n9. Inside the while loop, a local variable \"r\" of type struct original_data_type is declared.\n10. There are statements that assign the value of \"r\" to \"p\" and assign the value of \"p\" to \"r\", effectively copying the value of \"r\" to \"p\".\n11.

The program defines a struct named `original_data_type` with three members: `i` of type `int`, `j` of type `long`, and `k` of type `unsigned`.\n\n2. The function `fn1` is defined with two parameters: `p1` of type `unsigned` and `p5` of type `struct original_data_type`. It returns an `unsigned` value. There are no redundant data types in its parameter list.\n\n3. Inside the `fn1` function, the member `k` of `p5` struct is accessed.\n\n4. There is a label `w` followed by a `goto` statement.

Inside the `fn2` function, a variable `p` of type `struct original_data_type` is declared.\n\n7. The `fn1` function is called with `0` and `p` as arguments.\n\n8.
