The program defines a struct named \"h\" with three members: \"i\" of type \"signed\", \"j\" of type \"long\", and \"k\" of type \"unsigned\".\n\n2. It declares an unsigned variable \"l\" outside any function.\n\n3.

It defines a non-static function \"fn2\" with the following parameter:\n   - p1 (implicitly int)\n\n5.
