An `unsigned` variable `l` is declared outside any function.\n3. The function `fn1` is declared with the following parameters: an `unsigned` parameter, a `short` parameter, two `unsigned` parameters, and a parameter of type `struct original_data_type`. The return type of the function is `unsigned`.\n4. The function `fn2` is defined with a single parameter `p1`, which is of unknown type. Inside this function:\n   - A local variable `p` is declared of type `struct original_data_type`.\n   - An `int` variable `q` is declared.\n   - The function `fn1` is called with arguments `q`, `l`, `p1`, `3`, and `p`.\n   - There is an infinite loop that follows.\n     - Inside the loop, a local variable `r` is declared of type `struct original_data_type`.\n     - The values of `r` and `p` are assigned to themselves, which has no effect.\n5.
