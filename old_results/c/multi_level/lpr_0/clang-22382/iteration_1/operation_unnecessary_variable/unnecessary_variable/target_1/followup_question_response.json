In the `fn1` function, the parameter `p1` is unused and not referenced anywhere in the function. We can optimize it out.\n\n3.

The `fn2` function calls `fn1` with arguments `0`, `0`, and `p`. The returned value of `fn1` is not used, and the function has no other side effects. Therefore, we can optimize this function call by removing it.\n\n5. Inside the infinite `for` loop in the `fn2` function, a new `struct original_data_type` variable `r` is declared.
