The program defines a struct called `original_data_type` with three members: `i` of type `int`, `j` of type `long`, and `k` of type `unsigned`.\n\n2. The function `fn1` is declared as `static` and returns a `struct original_data_type`. It takes two parameters: `p1` of type `unsigned` and `p5` of type `struct original_data_type`. However, there are no redundant data types in the function declaration.\n\n3. Inside the function `fn1`, the member `k` of `p5` is accessed, which is not redundant.\n\n4. The label `w` is defined and a `goto` statement is used to jump to that label. This doesn't involve any redundant data types.\n\n5. The function `fn2` is defined as returning an `unsigned` and takes no parameters. Inside this function:\n   - A variable `p` of type `struct original_data_type` is declared and initialized.\n   - The function `fn1` is called with arguments `0` and `p` of type `struct original_data_type`.\n   - A while loop is started with condition `1`. Inside the loop:\n     - A variable `r` of type `struct original_data_type` is declared.\n     - The variables `p` and `r` are assigned the value of `p` in the statement `p = r = p`.
