Since the variable `r` is not used outside the `if` condition in the `fn2()` function, we can optimize it out if `h2` is `true`.\n2. The constant propagation optimization technique replaces the value of `r` with its initial assignment, which is `r[175][175][175]`.\n3. To perform constant propagation, we need to check if the condition `(h2)` is always `false` or `true`.\n4. Since `h2` is `2453134317`, which is a non-zero value, the condition `(h2)` will always be `true`.\n5.
