The function `fn3()` is called from `main()`, and `l` is printed using `printf`. We need to determine if the value of `l` is modified before this point or if it is a constant value.\n3. In the function `fn3()`, the comparison `1614298413 >= l` is performed. If `l` is a constant, we can evaluate the expression and replace it with the result. If it is not a constant, we need to check if it is modified before the comparison.\n4. After the comparison, the expression `4294967287 - 3854607982` is XORed with the result of the comparison. If `l` is a constant, we can perform the XOR operation and replace it with the result.\n5. To determine if `l` is a constant, we need to track its assignments and modifications throughout the program.\n\nBased on the provided code, `l` is never assigned or modified.
