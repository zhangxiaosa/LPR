Initialize the variable `u` to 0 at the global scope.\n2. Declare an array of `struct p` named `v` with 1 element.\n3. Declare a variable `w` of type `struct p` and initialize it with the values `{0x1C87E74FL, 816}`.\n4. Define the `main` function.\n5. Declare a variable `a` of type `struct p` and initialize it with the values `{8L, 666}`.\n6. Enter a `for` loop that continues as long as `u` is less than or equal to 1. Increment `u` by 1 in each iteration.\n7. Inside the loop:\n   - Assign the value of `w` to `a` and `v[0]`. This means `a` and `v[0]` will have the same values as `w`.\n   - Assign the value of `a` to `v[0]`. This step doesn't change the values since `v[0]` already has the same values as `a`.\n8.
