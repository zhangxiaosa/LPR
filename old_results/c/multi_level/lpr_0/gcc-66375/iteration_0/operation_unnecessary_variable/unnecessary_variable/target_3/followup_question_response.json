The variable `checksum` is updated in the loop using the functions `fn2` and addition with a constant.\n   - Inside the loop, `checksum = fn2(checksum, 3)` updates `checksum` with the value of `p1`, which is the current value of `checksum` itself.

Next, we observe that the variable `checksum` is modified within the loop using the function call `fn2(checksum, 3)` and an addition operation with a constant value.
