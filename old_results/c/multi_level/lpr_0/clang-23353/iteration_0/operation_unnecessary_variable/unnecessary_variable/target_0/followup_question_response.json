The variable `p1` is passed as an argument to the function `fn1`.\n2. In the loop inside the function `fn2`, the result of `fn1` is used as an operand for the `&&` operator along with `1`.\n3. Since the loop condition depends on `p3` and not `p1`, the value of `p1` is not used in the loop.\n4. Inside the loop, `p3` is decremented from `6` to `-6`.\n5. The return value of `fn1(p3, i) && 1` is then XORed with `h` as `h ^= fn1(p3, i) && 1`.\n6. After the loop, the variable `p2` is returned.\n\nTo optimize out the variable `p1`, we can perform copy propagation. Since `p1` is not used inside the loop, we can replace the function call `fn1(p3, i)` with the constant value `p1 * i`.
