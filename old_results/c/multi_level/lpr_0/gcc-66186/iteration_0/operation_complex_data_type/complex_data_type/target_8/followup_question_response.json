The `fn5` function is defined. It declares two local variables `n` of type `int` and `o` of type `unsigned`, and initializes them with the values `1L` and `0x5A683F60L` respectively. It then calls the `fn1` function with arguments `n`, `g`, and `g`, and returns `o`.\n4. The `fn1` function is defined. It declares two local variables `s` and `t` of type `int`, and initializes `s` with the value `0x57638FF4L` and `t` with the value `1L`. It then calls the `fn2` function with arguments `g`, `s`, and `g`, and returns `t`.\n5. The `fn2` function is defined. It declares a local variable `u` of type `unsigned` and initializes it with the value `0x30A04A8FL`.

It then conditionally calls the `fn4` function with arguments `ad`, `4294967287UL`, `ad`, `g`, and `p5` depending on the result of the function call. Finally, it returns `ae`.\n7. The `fn4` function is defined. It declares an array `ak` of type `short` with size `8`. It then contains nested loops where variables `p2` and `p4` are used as loop counters. Inside the nested loops, there is an `if` condition that checks if `h` is less than `0`. If true, it contains another nested loop that uses `p4` as a loop counter and checks the value of `ak[p3]`. Finally, it returns `g`.\n8. The `main` function is defined with no parameters and return type `int`. It calls the `fn5` function and returns its result.\n9.
