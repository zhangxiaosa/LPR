The program defines a global variable `g` of type `int`.\n2. It declares five function prototypes: `fn1`, `fn2`, `fn3`, `fn4`, and `fn5`.\n3. The program defines and implements the function `fn5`, which takes no arguments and returns an `int`. Inside `fn5`, it calls the function `fn1` with arguments `1L`, `g`, and `g`. Then it returns `0`.\n4. The program defines and implements the function `fn1`, which takes three arguments of type `unsigned short`, `unsigned`, and `unsigned short`, respectively, and returns an `int`. Inside `fn1`, it calls the function `fn2` with arguments `g`, `0x57638FF4L`, and `g`. Then it returns `1L`.\n5. The program defines and implements the function `fn2`, which takes three arguments of type `int`, `unsigned short`, and `unsigned`, respectively, and returns an `unsigned short`. Inside `fn2`, it conditionally calls the function `fn3` with arguments `0x9A5DL`, `g`, `p2`, `0x30A04A8FL`, and `p1`. If the condition is true, an empty statement is executed. Then it returns `0`.\n6. The program defines and implements the function `fn3`, which takes five arguments of type `int`, `int`, `int', `unsigned short`, and `int`, respectively, and returns a `short`. Inside `fn3`, it conditionally calls the function `fn4` with arguments `4294967289L`, `4294967287UL`, `4294967289L`, `g`, and `p5`. If the condition is true, an empty statement is executed. Then it returns `0xA3L`.\n7. The program defines and implements the function `fn4`, which takes five arguments of type `int`, `unsigned short`, `unsigned short`, `unsigned`, and `unsigned short`, respectively, and returns an `unsigned`. Inside `fn4`, it declares an array `ak` of type `short` with a size of 8. It then utilizes nested loops and conditional statements to perform certain operations. Finally, it returns the value of the global variable `g`.\n8. The program defines the `main` function, which takes no arguments and returns an `int`. Inside `main`, it calls the function `fn5` and then returns.\n\nIdentified functions other than `main`: `fn1`, `fn2`, `fn3`, `fn4`, and `fn5`.\n\nThe identified functions written in JSON format:\n```json\n{\n  \"target_list\": [\n    \"fn1\",\n    \"fn2\",\n    \"fn3\",\n    \"fn4\",\n    \"fn5\"\n  ]\n}\n```"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 908, "completion_tokens": 1099, "total_tokens": 2007}, "system_fingerprint": null}
