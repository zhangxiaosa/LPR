Loop unrolling is a technique that eliminates the overhead of loop control mechanisms by manually replicating the loop body multiple times. Here's the step-by-step analysis and modifications to optimize the given program:\n\n1. Initialize `f` to 0 outside the loop:\n```cpp\nf = 0;\n```\n\n2. Remove the outer loop as it becomes redundant with the loop unrolling:\n```cpp\nfor (; j; --j)\n    ;\n```\n\n3. Modify the loop condition to emulate the unrolled loop body:\n```cpp\nif (f == 0) {\n    // Loop iteration 1 *\n    // Loop iteration 2 *\n    // Loop iteration 3 *\n    // ... (unrolled loop body)\n}\n```\n\n4.
