The function `fn6` is declared, which takes two parameters of type `unsigned` (`p1` and `p2`) and returns an `unsigned` value.

The `main` function is defined with the following local variables:\n   - `int an`.\n   - `unsigned p2`.\n   - `short ao`.\n\n5. A `for` loop is started with the initial value of `w` as `3` and the loop condition as `w` (which is equivalent to `w != 0`). The loop decrements `w` by `1` in each iteration.\n\n6. Inside the loop, an `if` statement checks if `an` is assigned the value `250UL`. If true, the statements inside the `if` block are executed.\n\n7.
