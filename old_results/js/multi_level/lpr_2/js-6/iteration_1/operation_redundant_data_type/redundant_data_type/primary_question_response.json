Inside the function, a constant variable `c` is declared and initialized with the result of calling the `unshift` method on the `Array.prototype` object with the argument `2689987270`.\n3. The `unshift` method returns the new length of the array after adding the specified element at the beginning. In this case, it doesn't affect the functionality of the program but only returns a number.\n4. The program then uses the right shift operator `>>>` to perform a logical right shift of the value of `c` by `2689987270` bits. This is an interesting choice of operation since shifting a number by such a large number of bits is likely to lose significant information.\n5.
