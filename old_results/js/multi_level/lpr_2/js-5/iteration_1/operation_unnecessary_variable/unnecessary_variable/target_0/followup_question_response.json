Replace all occurrences of `new d(a, {})` with `new Proxy(a, {})` since `d` is not used anymore.\n\n3. Since `e.prototype` is set to `f` and `f` is not used anywhere else, replace `e.prototype = f;` with `e.prototype = undefined;` to remove the assignment to `f`.\n\n4. Remove the assignment `{\"prototype\": a} = a;` since it doesn't have any effect.\n\n5. Update the `return` statement to `return a;` since `g` is simply an alias for `a`.\n\nThe modified program after optimization is as follows:\n\n```javascript\nfunction opt() {\n    function a() {}\n    let f;\n    const e = new Proxy(a, {});\n    e.prototype = undefined;\n    return a;\n}\n```\n\nHere's the final program in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"program\": \"function opt() {\\n    function a() {}\\n    let f;\\n    const e = new Proxy(a, {});\\n    e.prototype = undefined;\\n    return a;\\n}\"\n}\n```"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}, {"index": 1, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To optimize out the variable `d`, which is the target to be optimized, we can perform constant propagation.
