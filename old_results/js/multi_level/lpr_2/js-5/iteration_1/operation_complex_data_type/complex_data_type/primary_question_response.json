Here's the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. Define an empty list `target_list` to store the names of variables with complex data types.\n   \n2. Look for variable declarations and assignments in the program.\n   \n3. Identify variables with complex data types and add their names to the `target_list`.\n   - In the given program, the following variables have complex data types:\n     - `d`: Assigned the value `Proxy`, which is a complex data type.\n     - `e`: Assigned the value `new d(a, {})`, where `d` is a complex data type and the `new` keyword indicates object creation.\n     - `f`: A regular variable with no assigned value or specific data type.\n     - `g`: Assigned the value `a`, which is a function.\n\n4. Create a JSON object using the identified variable names and the `target_list` as the value for the key `'target_list'`.\n   \n5.
