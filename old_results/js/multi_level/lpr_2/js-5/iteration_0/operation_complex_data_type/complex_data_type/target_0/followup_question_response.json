Assign the value of `a` to the variable `g`.\n10. Return `g`.\n\nTo decompose the complex data type variable `b` into variables with primary data types, we can replace the usage of `b` with its value in each step. Here's the modified program:\n\n```javascript\nfunction opt() {\n    function a() {}\n    let b = a;\n    let c = {};\n    let d = Proxy;\n    let e = new d(a, c);\n    let f;\n    e.prototype = f;\n    ({\n        \"prototype\": a\n    } = a);\n    const g = a;\n    return g;\n}\n```\n\nNow we can convert this modified program into a JSON file using Markdown syntax.

Identify the primary data types used in the program and assign them to separate variables:\n```javascript\nconst a = undefined;  // No direct assignment found, initializes to undefined\nconst b = a;\nlet c = {};\nlet d = Proxy;\nlet e = new d(b, c);\nlet f;\ne.prototype = f;\n({ \"prototype\": a } = b);\nconst g = a;\n```\n\n3. Optimize the target variable `b`. Since `b` is assigned the value of `a` (which is `undefined`) before any modifications, we can remove the assignment altogether and directly assign `b` to `undefined`:\n```javascript\nconst a = undefined;\nconst b = undefined;\nlet c = {};\nlet d = Proxy;\nlet e = new d(b, c);\nlet f;\ne.prototype = f;\n({ \"prototype\": a } = b);\nconst g = a;\n```\n\n4.
