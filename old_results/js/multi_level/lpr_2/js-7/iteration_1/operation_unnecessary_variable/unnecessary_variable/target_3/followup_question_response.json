Take note of the target function, `opt()`, which initializes a variable `b` and returns the result of calling `isFinite()` on `b`.\n2. The variable `b` is assigned a new `Proxy` object that wraps an empty array.\n3. The `valueOf` function of `b` is overridden with an empty function. This overrides the default behavior of returning the primitive value of `b` when coercion is attempted.\n4. Finally, the program checks if `isFinite(b)` evaluates to true and returns the result.\n\nSince `b` is not used anywhere else in the program, we can optimize it out by removing the variable assignment and the overridden `valueOf` function.
