The function ultimately returns the value of variable g, which is assigned the value of variable f, and the value of variable f is assigned the value of the last element from the `Array.prototype`. Therefore, the value of variable e is not utilized.\n\nBased on this analysis, it is safe to optimize out the variable e by removing it from the code.

The value of \"f\" is then assigned to \"g\" using `const g = f`.\n6. Finally, \"g\" is returned, which is the value of \"f\" (previously assigned by \"e.pop()\") and should be unaffected by our changes.\n\nConsidering the optimizations, we can remove the variable \"e\" and replace its usages with `Array.prototype`.
