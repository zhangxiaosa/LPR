Variable `c` is assigned the result of calling the `unshift` method on `a`'s prototype, passing `a` as an argument.

Variable `d` is assigned the result of calling the `toLocaleString` method on `a`. The `toLocaleString` method converts the elements of the array to string representations and concatenates them using a locale-specific separator.\n   - `const d = a.toLocaleString();`\n\n4. Variable `e` is assigned the result of calling the `padStart` method on `d`, passing `c` as the target length and using the default padding character, which is a space.
