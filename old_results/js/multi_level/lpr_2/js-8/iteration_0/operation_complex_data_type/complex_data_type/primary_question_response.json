Here is the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. The program declares a function named `opt()`.\n2. Within the function, an empty array `a` is declared.\n3. A destructuring assignment is used to extract the `__proto__` property from `a` and assign it to the variable `b`.\n4. The `toLocaleString()` method is called on `b` and assigned to the variable `c`. Here, `b` is an object, which suggests a complex data type.\n5. The `unshift()` method is called on the array `b` with `c` as the argument and assigned to the variable `d`. Here, `b` is again an array, indicating a complex data type.\n6. An error catch block is defined, but it doesn't contain any variable declarations.\n7. A function named `e()` is declared within the catch block.\n8. The function `e()` is returned from the `opt()` function.\n9. The `opt()` function itself is not called or executed in the given program.\n\nBased on the analysis, the variables with complex data types are `b` and `d`.
