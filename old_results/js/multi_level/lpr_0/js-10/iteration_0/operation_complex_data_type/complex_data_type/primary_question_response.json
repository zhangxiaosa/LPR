The variable `v2` is assigned the `__proto__` property of `v1`, which is an object representing the prototype of `v1`. It is also a complex data type.\n3. The variable `v3` is assigned the return value of the `unshift` method on `v2`, which modifies the array and returns the new length. It is a number, a primary data type.\n4.
