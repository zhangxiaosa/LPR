The return value of `unshift` is the new length of the modified array, which is stored in `c`.\n3. The function `d` is defined.\n4. `e` is declared and assigned the result of calling the `toString` method on `d`. This converts the function `d` to its string representation.\n5. `f` is declared and assigned the result of calling the `padEnd` method on `e` with `c` as the argument. The `padEnd` method pads the string with a specified character (by default, a space) until the resulting string reaches the specified length (`c` in this case).\n6. The value of `f` is returned as the result of the `opt` function.\n\nTo optimize the target variable `b`, we need to replace it with a variable of a primitive data type. In this case, we can replace `b` with `[]`, which is an empty array.
