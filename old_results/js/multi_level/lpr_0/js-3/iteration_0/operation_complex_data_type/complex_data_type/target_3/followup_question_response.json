Decompose the complex data types into variables with primary data types:\n   - The variable `a` is an array, so we'll keep it as is.\n   - The variable `b` is assigned `Array.prototype`, which is an object that represents the prototype for the Array constructor. Since we want to optimize the `d` function, we can remove this variable as it is not being used.\n   - The variable `c` is assigned the result of calling the `unshift` method on `b` (Array.prototype) with the argument `undefined`. Since `b` is not used, we can remove the assignment to `c` as well.\n   - The function `d` is defined and can stay as is.\n   - The variable `e` is assigned the result of calling the `toString` method on the function `d`. Since we want to optimize this function, we can remove this variable assignment and directly call `d.toString()` when needed.\n   - The variable `f` is assigned the result of calling the `padEnd` method on the string `e` with the argument `c`. Since `e` is not used anymore, we can remove the assignment to `f` as well.\n\n2.

Decompose `const a = [];`:\n   - The variable `a` is an array data type, so we decompose it into `const a = []` (an empty array).\n\n2. Decompose `const b = Array.prototype;`:\n   - The variable `b` is assigned the value of `Array.prototype`, which is an object. Since the focus is on optimization of function `d`, this assignment is not required for optimization. Therefore, we can omit this statement since it's not contributing to the optimization.\n\n3. Decompose `const c = b.unshift(undefined);`:\n   - The variable `c` is assigned the value of the `unshift()` method on `b`. As mentioned earlier, the variable `b` is not contributing to the optimization, so we can omit this statement.\n   - Alternatively, if you want to include it, `const c = [].unshift(undefined);` can be used, where `c` will be assigned the value `1`. This is because `unshift()` adds an element to the beginning of an array and returns the new length of the array.\n\n4. Decompose function `d`:\n   - The function `d` does not have any parameters or logic defined, so we can omit this entire function.\n\n5. Decompose `const e = d.toString();`:\n   - Since we excluded the function `d` from the optimization, this statement is also unnecessary. Therefore, we can omit it.\n\n6.
