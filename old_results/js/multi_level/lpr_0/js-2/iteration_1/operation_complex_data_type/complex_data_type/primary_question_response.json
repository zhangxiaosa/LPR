The program defines a function named `opt()`.\n\n2.

This method prepends a new element to the beginning of an array and returns the new length of the array.\n   - `d` is declared and initialized with the result of calling the `toLocaleString()` method on `bLength`. This method converts the number to a string representing the number in localized format.\n   \n3. After that, the `replace()` method is called on `d` with the argument `bLength`.
