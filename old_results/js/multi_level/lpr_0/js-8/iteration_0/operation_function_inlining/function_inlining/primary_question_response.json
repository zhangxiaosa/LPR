In the try block:\n   - An empty array `a` is declared and initialized.\n   - The object destructure pattern is used to extract the `__proto__` property from `a` and assign it to `b`.\n   - The `toLocaleString()` method is called on `b` and assigned to `c`.\n   - The `unshift()` method is called on `b` with `c` as an argument and assigned to `d`.\n4.
