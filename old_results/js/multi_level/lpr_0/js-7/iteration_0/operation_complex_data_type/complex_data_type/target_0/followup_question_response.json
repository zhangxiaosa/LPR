Declare an empty array variable `a`: `const a = [];`\n2. Create a new `Proxy` object `b` with `a` as the target and `Proxy` as the handler: `const b = new Proxy(a, Proxy);`\n3. Define a `valueOf` function on `b` that does nothing: `b.valueOf = function() {};`\n4. Check if `b` is a finite value using the `isFinite()` function: `return isFinite(b);`\n\nTo decompose the program, we need to replace the complex data type variable `b` with a variable of a primary data type. Let's replace `b` with its corresponding data type and update the program:\n\n```javascript\nfunction opt() {\n  const a = [];\n  const bTarget = a;\n  const bHandler = Proxy;\n  const b = new bHandler(bTarget);\n  b.valueOf = function() {};\n  return isFinite(b);\n}\n```\n\nIn this modified program, we've created two new variables `bTarget` and `bHandler` to represent the target and handler arguments of the `Proxy` constructor, respectively.
