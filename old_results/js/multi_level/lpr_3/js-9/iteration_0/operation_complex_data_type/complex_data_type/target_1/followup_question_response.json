The variable `c` is assigned the prototype of `b`, which means it holds a reference to the prototype object of the array `b`. We'll decompose `c` into a variable of type `Object`.\n\n4. The `unshift()` method is called on `c` and the result is stored in `d`. Since `d` represents the return value of the `unshift()` method, we'll decompose it into a variable of type `Number`.\n\n5. The `Reflect.get()` method is called with `a` and `127` as arguments, and the result is stored in `e`.
