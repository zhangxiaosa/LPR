The variable \"b\" is declared and assigned the value of the \"__proto__\" property of \"a\".\n4.

We can now write this information into a JSON file using Markdown syntax:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"target_list\": [\"opt\"]\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that the JSON provided above is surrounded by Markdown syntax (triple backticks with \"json\" after the opening backticks).
