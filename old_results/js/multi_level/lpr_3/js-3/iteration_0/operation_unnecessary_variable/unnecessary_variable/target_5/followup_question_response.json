Constant propagation:\n   - Since `d` is an empty function with no side effects and `toLocaleString()` has no arguments, we can replace `e` with an empty string.\n   - Since `c` is obtained by unshifting `undefined` to an empty array, we can replace `String(c)` with the string value `\"1\"`.\n   - Substituting these optimizations, the program becomes:\n      ```javascript\n      function opt() {\n          const a = [];\n          const b = Object.getPrototypeOf(a);\n          const c = b.unshift(undefined);\n\n          function d() {}\n          const e = \"\";\n          const f = e.padEnd(\"1\");\n          return f;\n      }\n      ```\n\n2. Copy propagation:\n   - The variable `f` is only assigned once, which means its value can be propagated directly to the return statement.\n   - By replacing `return f;` with `return \"\".padEnd(\"1\");`, the program becomes:\n      ```javascript\n      function opt() {\n          const a = [];\n          const b = Object.getPrototypeOf(a);\n          const c = b.unshift(undefined);\n\n          function d() {}\n          const e = \"\";\n          return \"\".padEnd(\"1\");\n      }\n      ```\n\nSince the variable `f` is no longer used, it is optimized out of the program.
