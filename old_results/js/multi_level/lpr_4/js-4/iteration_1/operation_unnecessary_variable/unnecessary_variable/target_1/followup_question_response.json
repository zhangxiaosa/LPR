Here is a step-by-step analysis of the optimizations:\n\n1. Constant Propagation: In the line `const f = b.pop();`, the value returned by the `pop()` method is assigned to the variable `f`. Since the array `b` is a constant array with a fixed length of 256 and the last element is being popped, we can determine that the value being assigned to `f` is always `4294967297`. Therefore, we can replace the line `const f = b.pop();` with `const f = 4294967297;`.\n\n2. Copy Propagation: In the line `const g = f;`, the value of `f` is assigned to the variable `g`. Since we have already determined that `f` is a constant with the value `4294967297`, we can replace the line `const g = f;` with `const g = 4294967297;`.\n\n3. Remove Unused Variable: After performing constant propagation and copy propagation optimizations, we can see that the variable `f` is no longer used in the program. Therefore, we can remove the line `const f = 4294967297;`.\n\n4.
