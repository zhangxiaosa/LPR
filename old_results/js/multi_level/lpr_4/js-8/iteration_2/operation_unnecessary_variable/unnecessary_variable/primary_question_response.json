Within the `try` block, the following code is executed:\n   - `[].__proto__`: Accesses the prototype of an empty array.\n   - `unshift()`: Calls the `unshift()` function on the empty array's prototype.\n   - `[].__proto__.toLocaleString()`: Calls the `toLocaleString()` function on the empty array's prototype.\n\n4.
