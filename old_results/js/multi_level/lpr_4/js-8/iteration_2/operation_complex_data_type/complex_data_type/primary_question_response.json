However, the provided code is the same twice. I assume it was duplicated unintentionally.\n\nNonetheless, I'll perform the analysis on one of the code snippets. Here's the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. The program defines a function named `opt`.\n2. Inside the function, there is a `try` block.\n3. In the `try` block, an operation is performed on an empty array `[]`. The operation is `unshift`, which inserts one or more elements at the beginning of an array. In this case, the operation is performed on the prototype of the empty array by accessing `__proto__`.\n4. The elements being inserted into the array are obtained by calling the `toLocaleString` method on the prototype of the empty array `[]`.\n5. If an exception is caught in the `try` block, a function named `e` is defined.\n6. The function `opt` returns the function `e`.\n\nBased on this analysis, there are no variables with complex data types defined in the given code snippet.
