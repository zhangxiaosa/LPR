If `c` is not used anywhere, it can be optimized out completely from the program.\n4. If `c` is used, we'll replace all occurrences of `c` with its value `2689987270`.\n\nIn the given program:\n\n```javascript\nfunction opt() {\n    const c = Array.prototype.unshift(2689987270);\n    const g = c >>> 2689987270;\n    return g;\n}\n```\n\nYou mentioned that the target to be optimized out is `c`. However, in the given code, `c` is not used in any subsequent expressions or statements.

The value passed to `unshift()` is `2689987270`, and it returns the new length of the modified array.\n\nThe variable `c` is then right-shifted by `2689987270` bits using the `>>>` operator and assigned to the variable `g`.
