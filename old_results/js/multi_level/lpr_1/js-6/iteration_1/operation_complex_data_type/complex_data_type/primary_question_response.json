The first part is a method call on the `Array.prototype` object, specifically the `unshift` method, passing `2689987270` as an argument. This method adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array and returns the new length of the array.\n6. The second part is a bitwise right shift operator (`>>>`) followed by the number `2689987270`.
