Constant propagation involves replacing all occurrences of `b` with its constant value.

The program defines a function `opt()` which returns the result of `isFinite(b)`.\n\n2. Inside the function, a constant `b` is declared and initialized with the expression `new Proxy([], Proxy)`.\n\n3. The `valueOf` method of `b` is overridden to an empty function.\n\n4. Finally, the function `isFinite()` is called with `b` as an argument.\n\nFrom the analysis, we can see that `b` is not used anywhere else in the program.
