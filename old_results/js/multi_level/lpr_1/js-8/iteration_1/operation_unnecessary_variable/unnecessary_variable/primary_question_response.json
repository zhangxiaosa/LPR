The program defines a function named `opt()`.\n\n2. Inside the function, a `try...catch` block is used.\n\n3. Within the `try` block:\n   - A local variable named `a` is declared and assigned an empty array.\n   - The `Object.getPrototypeOf()` function is called with `a` as an argument. The resulting value is stored in a local variable named `protoOfA`.\n   - The `toLocaleString()` method is called on `protoOfA`. The resulting value is stored in a local variable named `protoString`.\n   - The `apply()` method is called on an empty array `[]` with `unshift` as the function to apply. The `apply()` method is used to invoke a function with a specified `this` value and arguments provided as an array. In this case, `protoOfA` is used as the `this` value, and `protoString` is passed as the argument. The resulting value is stored in a local variable named `unshiftResult`.\n\n4. If an exception occurs within the `try` block, control flows to the `catch` block.\n\n5. Inside the `catch` block:\n   - A named function expression named `eContent` is defined.\n\n6.
