The variable `b` is assigned the value of the function `a`. Since `a` is a constant, we can replace all occurrences of `b` with `a`.\n2. The property `\"prototype\"` of the object being destructured is assigned the value of `b`, which has now been replaced with `a`. So we can simplify this assignment to remove the destructuring and directly assign `a` to `f`.\n3. The variable `g` is assigned the value of `a`, which is now the same as the previous value of `b`.

Since `b` only appears on the right-hand side of the assignments and never changes, we can propagate the constant value of `a` to `b` throughout the program.\n3. In the line `let eTarget = b`, `eTarget` will now be assigned the constant value of `a`.\n4. As `b` is no longer required, we can remove the declaration `const b = a`.\n5. In the line `let e = new Proxy(eTarget, eHandler)`, `eTarget` now holds the constant value of `a`, so it can be directly used in the `new Proxy` expression.\n6. In the line `({ \"prototype\": a } = b)`, since `b` is now removed and not used elsewhere, this line becomes unnecessary and can be removed.\n7. In the line `const g = a`, as `a` is a constant value, we can directly assign `g` the constant value of `a`.\n8.
