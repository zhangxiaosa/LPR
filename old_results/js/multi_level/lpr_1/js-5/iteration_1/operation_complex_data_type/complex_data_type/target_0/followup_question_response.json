The program defines a function named `opt` which takes no arguments and returns a variable `g`.\n2. Inside the `opt` function, there is a nested function named `a`.\n3. `let e = new Proxy(a, {});` creates a new instance of `Proxy` with the function `a` as the target and an empty object as the handler. The resulting `Proxy` object is assigned to the variable `e`.\n4. `e.prototype = undefined;` sets the `prototype` property of `e` to `undefined`. This effectively removes the prototype chain, making `e` an instance without a prototype.\n5. `({ \"prototype\": a } = a);` destructures the `a` object and assigns its `prototype` property to the variable `a` itself. This line of code is equivalent to `a = a.prototype;`.\n6. `const g = a;` assigns the value of `a` to the variable `g`.\n7. Finally, `g` is returned from the `opt` function.\n\nVariable decomposition:\n- `e` is a complex data type - an instance of `Proxy` that wraps the function `a`.
