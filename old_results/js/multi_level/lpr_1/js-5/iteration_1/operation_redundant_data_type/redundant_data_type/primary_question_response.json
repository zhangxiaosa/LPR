The program defines a function named `opt()`.\n\n2. Within `opt()`, there is a function declaration named `a()`. This function does not have a return type specified, so it can be considered as having an implicit return type of `undefined`.\n\n3. A variable `e` is declared and assigned a new `Proxy` object with `a` as the target and an empty object as the handler.\n\n4. The `prototype` property of `e` is set to `undefined`.\n\n5. An object literal is created with a single property named `\"prototype\"`, and the value of `a` is assigned to it. Simultaneously, the value of `a` is also assigned to the variable `g`.\n\n6. The function `opt()` returns the value of `g`.\n\nIdentification of redundant data types:\n\nIn the provided program, there are no explicit data types defined using `typedef` or any other type specification method.
