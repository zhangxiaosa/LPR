Inside the loop:\n   - In the condition `if (c = 250UL)`, `c` is assigned the constant value `250UL` and can be optimized by copy propagation.\n   - `h = a || (c = g) == 0x294A85636008822LL`: `c` is reassigned with the value of `g` and can be optimized by copy propagation.\n     - Note that the expression `(c = g)` is also part of the condition in the `if` statement, but it does not affect optimization since `c` is already assigned a constant value and the condition is evaluated based on the value of `a`.\n   - `short d = 0xBCD1`: Not optimized as it is declared and assigned within the loop.\n   - `fn1(d, fn2(1 - c, 0xECL))`: No optimization can be performed on the arguments of the function calls.\n   - `f = 1UL`: Not optimized as it is assigned within the loop.\n4.
