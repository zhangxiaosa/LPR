Remove unused variables: Since variable `b` and variable `c` are not used in the program, we can remove their declarations and assignments.\n\n2. Simplify the loop conditions: The loop condition `for (g = 3; g; g -= 1)` can be simplified to `for (; g; g -= 1)` since `g` is already initialized with the value `3`.\n\n3. Assign value directly: Instead of assigning `1UL` to variable `f` in the if statement, we can assign `1` directly since `f` is declared as `long`, and the type `1` will be implicitly converted to `long`.\n\n4. Remove unnecessary parentheses: We can remove the unnecessary parentheses around the expression `(fn1(d, fn2(1 - c, 0xECL)) - h & 1UL)` in the if statement.\n\n5. Remove unnecessary computations: Since the value of `a` is always `1`, the expression `h = a || (c = g) == 0x294A85636008822LL` can be simplified to `h = 1`.\n\n6.
