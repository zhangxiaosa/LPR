Replace every occurrence of `d` with `unsigned` throughout the program, including function parameters, variable declarations, and return types.\n2. Update the function signatures accordingly. The function `fn2` will now have parameters and return type of `unsigned`.\n3. Replace the variable declarations for `unsigned` variables `k` and `l`.\n4. Continue replacing the variables, making sure to update their types. Variable `m` is already of type `short`, so it doesn't need to be modified.\n5. Replace the assignment of `ac` with `1L` since its type is `short`.\n6. In the `main` function, update the types of variables `i` and `am`.\n7. Inside the `for` loop conditional statement, replace the constant `250UL` with `250L`.\n8.
