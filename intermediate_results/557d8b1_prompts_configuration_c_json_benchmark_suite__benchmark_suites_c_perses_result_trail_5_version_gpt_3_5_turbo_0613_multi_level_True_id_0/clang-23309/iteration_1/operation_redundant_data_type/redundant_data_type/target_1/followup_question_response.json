Starting with the function `fn1`:\n   - The parameters `p1` and `p2` are of type `long`. We will substitute them with `unsigned`.\n   - The return type of the function is `long`. We will substitute it with `unsigned`.\n\n   After the substitution, `fn1` becomes:\n   ```c\n   unsigned fn1(unsigned p1, unsigned p2) {\n     return p1 - p2;\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. Moving to the function `fn2`:\n   - The parameters `p1` and `p2` are of type `unsigned`, which matches the target data type.\n   - The return type of the function is `unsigned`, which matches the target data type.\n\n   Therefore, `fn2` remains unchanged:\n   ```c\n   unsigned fn2(unsigned p1, unsigned p2) {\n     return p1;\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. Next, we have the global variables:\n   - Variable `e` is of type `unsigned`, which matches the target data type.\n   - Variable `f` is of type `long`. We will substitute it with `unsigned`.\n   - Variable `g` is of type `short`. We will substitute it with `unsigned`.\n\n   After the substitution, the global variables become:\n   ```c\n   unsigned e;\n   unsigned f;\n   unsigned short g;\n   ```\n\n4. Inside the `main` function:\n   - Variable `c` is of type `int`. We will substitute it with `unsigned`.\n   - Variable `a` is of type `short`. We will substitute it with `unsigned short`.\n   - The loop control variable `g` is already substituted with `unsigned short`.\n   - In the `if` condition, there is an assignment `c = 250UL`. We will substitute `250UL` with `250` since it already matches the target data type.\n   - Variable `d` is of type `short`. We will substitute it with `unsigned short`.\n   - In the condition `fn2(1 - c, 0xECL) - a & 1UL`, we will substitute `1UL` with `1` since it already matches the target data type.\n\n   After the substitutions, the `main` function becomes:\n   ```c\n   int main() {\n     unsigned c;\n     unsigned short a = 1;\n     unsigned short g;\n\n     for (g = 3; g; g -= 1) {\n       if (c = 250) {\n         a || (c = g);\n         unsigned short d = 0xBCD1;\n         if (fn1(d, fn2(1 - c, 0xECL)) - a & 1)\n           f = 1;\n       }\n     }\n\n     e = f;\n     printf(\"checksum = %X\\n\", e);\n     return 0;\n   }\n   ```\n\n5.

Replace `unsigned` in the arithmetic operation `- a & 1UL` with `int`: `fn1(d, fn2(1 - c, 0xECL)) - a & 1UL`\n\n12.
