Here is the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. The initial value of `d` is assigned as `0xBCD1`. Let's propagate this constant value wherever `d` is used.\n\n2. Inside the `if` statement, `d` is used as the first parameter of the function `fn1`, and `1U - c` is used as the second parameter. Since `d` is a constant `0xBCD1`, we can replace `d` with `0xBCD1` and simplify `1U - c` to `1 - c` (since `c` is an integer). The expression becomes `fn1(0xBCD1, 1 - c)`.\n\n3. The result of `fn1` is then subtracted from `a` (`fn1(d, 1U - c) - a`). Since `a` is a constant `1`, we can simplify this expression to `fn1(d, 1 - c) - 1`.\n\n4. Next, the subtraction result is bitwise ANDed with `1`. Since `1` is a constant, we can evaluate this expression to either `0` or `1`.\n\n5. The result of the bitwise AND operation is then assigned to `f`, which can be simplified to `f = 0` or `f = 1`.\n\n6.
