Since `long` is the original data type, no changes are required.\n   - `fn2` has two parameters of type `unsigned`. Since `unsigned` is the original data type, no changes are required.\n\n2.

The value `1` can be represented by an `int` without losing any precision. Therefore, `a` can be changed to type `int`.\n\n3.
