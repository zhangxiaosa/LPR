Enter the `main` function:\n   - Start a `for` loop with `g` initialized to 3 and the loop condition as `g`.\n     - Check if `c` is assigned the value 250 (unsigned long).

If false, assign the value of `g` to `c`.\n       - Declare a short variable `d` with the value 0xBCD1.\n       - Call `fn1` with arguments `d` and the result of calling `fn2` with arguments `(1 - c)` and `0xECL`.\n       - Perform subtraction `fn1(d, fn2(1 - c, 0xECL)) - a`.\n       - Perform bitwise AND with 1UL on the subtraction result.\n       - Check if the result is non-zero.

Next, apply the bitwise AND operator on `(d - (1UL - c)) - a` and `1UL`. This can be written as `(d - (1UL - c)) - a & 1UL`. \n\n4. Simplify the expression further:\n   - `a` is a constant and its initial value is `1`, so the expression becomes `(d - (1UL - c)) - 1 & 1UL`.\n   - Since `- 1` is the same as `~0UL`, the expression can be rewritten as `(d - (1UL - c)) & 1UL`.\n\n5. Replace the resulting expression in the if-statement: `if ((d - (1UL - c)) & 1UL)`\n\n6.
