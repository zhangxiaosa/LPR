Inside the `if (c = 250U)` condition, we can simplify the code by replacing `c` with its constant value `250U`.\n\n3. Since the condition `if (c = 250U)` is always true, we can remove the `if` statement and directly assign `g` to `c` without the need for the `a || (c = g)` check.\n\n4. The expression `1U - c` inside the `fn1` function call can be simplified to `-249U`.\n\n5. The expression `fn1(d, -249U - a) - a & 1` can be simplified to `fn1(d, -250) - 1 & 1`.\n\n6.

The variable `d` is assigned the value 0xBCD1 inside the `if` statement. Since the `if` condition is based on the comparison `c = 250U`, and if it is true, `d` is always assigned 0xBCD1, we can consider the value of `d` to be a constant.\n\n2. Moving further, we see that `fn1(d, 1U - c)` is called. Since `d` is a constant, we can replace the argument with the actual value `0xBCD1` and simplify the expression.\n\n3. The expression `1U - c` can be simplified since `c` is assigned the value `250U` inside the `if` statement. Therefore, `1U - c` evaluates to `1U - 250U` which results in a negative constant value.\n\n4. The expression `fn1(d, 1U - c) - a & 1` is evaluated. Since `d` has been replaced with its constant value `0xBCD1` and `1U - c` has been simplified, we can further simplify this expression by substituting the values.\n\n5.
